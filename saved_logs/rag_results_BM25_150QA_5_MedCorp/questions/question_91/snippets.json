        "content": "Smooth-pursuit deficits Smooth pursuit requires the coordination of many brain regions that are far away from each other. This makes it particularly susceptible to impairment from a variety of disorders and conditions. Schizophrenia There is significant evidence that smooth pursuit is deficient in people with schizophrenia and their relatives. People with schizophrenia tend to have trouble pursuing very fast targets. This impairment is correlated with less activation in areas known to play a role in pursuit, such as the frontal eye field. However, other studies have shown that people with schizophrenia show relatively normal pursuit, compared to controls, when tracking objects that move unexpectedly. The greatest deficits are when the patients track objects of a predictable velocity which begin moving at a predictable time. This study speculates that smooth pursuit deficits in schizophrenia are a function of the patients' inability to store motion vectors.",

        "content": "Schizophrenia Schizophrenia is associated with deficits in motivation, commonly grouped under other negative symptoms such as reduced spontaneous speech. The experience of \u201cliking\u201d is frequently reported to be intact, both behaviorally and neurally, although results may be specific to certain stimuli, such as monetary rewards. Furthermore, implicit learning and simple reward-related tasks are also intact in schizophrenia. Rather, deficits in the reward system are apparent during reward-related tasks that are cognitively complex. These deficits are associated with both abnormal striatal and OFC activity, as well as abnormalities in regions associated with cognitive functions such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC).

        "title": "Normal eye tracking is associated with abnormal morphology of medial temporal lobe structures in schizophrenia.",
        "content": "Eye tracking and brain morphology assessed by magnetic resonance imaging were examined in 48 patients in their first episode of schizophrenia and in 15 normal controls. Schizophrenic patients showed higher rates of eye tracking dysfunction and more abnormal brain morphology involving the lateral ventricles, medial temporal lobe (MTL) structures and the frontal-parietal cortex than controls. Enlargement of the lateral ventricles and global rating of abnormal brain morphology were significantly more prevalent in male schizophrenics than female schizophrenics. These findings indicate that abnormalities in a variety of brain regions are present in some schizophrenics during the period shortly after the first hospitalization and could not be a function of treatment or chronic illness. We found no relation between abnormal eye tracking and any single feature of abnormal brain morphology. However, normal eye tracking was significantly associated with MTL abnormalities in schizophrenics, reflecting an inverse association between quality of eye tracking and degree of abnormality in MTL structures. These results suggest that abnormal eye tracking is not mediated by the same processes that lead to structural brain anomalies in schizophrenia.",

        "content": "There is also growing evidence that group II metabotropic glutamate receptor agonists may play a role in the treatment of schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is associated with deficits in cortical inhibitory interneurons that release GABA and synaptic abnormalities associated with deficits in NMDA receptor function. These inhibitory deficits may impair cortical function via cortical disinhibition and asynchrony. The drug LY354740 (also known as Eglumegad, an mGlu2/3 agonist) was shown to attenuate physiologic and cognitive abnormalities in animal and human studies of NMDA receptor antagonist and serotonergic hallucinogen effects, supporting the subsequent clinical evidence of efficacy for an mGluR2/3 agonist in the treatment of schizophrenia.",

        "title": "The perception of heading during eye movements.",
        "content": "When a person walks through a rigid environment while holding eyes and head fixed, the pattern of retinal motion flows radially away from a point, the focus of expansion (Fig. 1a). Under such conditions of translation, heading corresponds to the focus of expansion and people identify it readily. But when making an eye/head movement to track an object off to the side, retinal motion is no longer radial (Fig. 1b). Heading perception in such situations has been modelled in two ways. Extra-retinal models monitor the velocity of rotational movements through proprioceptive or efference information from the extraocular and neck muscles and use that information to discount rotation effects. Retinal-image models determine (and eliminate) rotational components from the retinal image alone. These models have been tested by measuring heading perception under two conditions. First, observers judged heading while tracking a point on a simulated ground plane. Second, they fixated a stationary point and the flow field simulated the effects of a tracking eye movement. Extra-retinal models predict poorer performance in the simulated condition because the eyes do not move. Retinal-image models predict no difference in performance because the two conditions produce identical patterns of retinal motion. Warren and Hannon observed similar performance and concluded that people do not require extra-retinal information to judge heading with eye/head movements present, but they used extremely slow tracking eye movements of 0.2-1.2 deg s-1; a moving observer frequently tracks objects at much higher rates (L. Stark, personal communication). Here we examine heading judgements at higher, more typical eye movement velocities and find that people require extra-retinal information about eye position to perceive heading accurately under many viewing conditions.",
