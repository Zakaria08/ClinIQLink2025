        "title": "Pulmonary edema",
        "content": "Pulmonary edema (PE), also known as pulmonary congestion, is liquid accumulation in the tissue and air spaces of the lungs. It leads to impaired gas exchange and may cause respiratory failure. It is due to either failure of the left ventricle of the heart to remove blood adequately from the pulmonary circulation (cardiogenic pulmonary edema), or an injury to the lung tissue or blood vessels of the lung (non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema). Treatment is focused on three aspects: firstly improving respiratory function, secondly, treating the underlying cause, and thirdly avoiding further damage to the lung. Pulmonary edema, especially when sudden (acute), can lead to respiratory failure or cardiac arrest due to hypoxia. It is a cardinal feature of congestive heart failure. The term edema is from the Greek (oid\u0113ma, \"swelling\"), from \u03bf\u1f30\u03b4\u03ad\u03c9 (oid\u00e9\u014d, \"(I) swell\").",

        "title": "[An autopsy case of pulmonary metastasis of cholangiocellular carcinoma associated with marked fibrotic change of the lungs].",
        "content": "An autopsy case of pulmonary metastasis of cholangiocellular carcinoma is presented. A 44-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital because of dyspnea, general fatigue and a sense of abdominal fullness on February 5, 1990. In November 1986, at an other hospital, she had been diagnosed as having diffuse metastatic lung tumor and multiple bone metastases, by transbronchial lung biopsy and other examinations. During the clinical course, she was not received chest irradiation and chemotherapy which induced fibrotic change of lungs. Chest X-ray film on December 21, 1986 showed diffuse nodular shadows in both lung fields. Chest X-ray film on February 4, 1990 showed diffuse reticular shadows with marked shrinkage of lung fields. She died two months after admission. The primary site of the carcinoma was not determined clinically, but was revealed by autopsy to be cholangiocellular carcinoma of the liver, with generalized metastasis. Microscopic findings of the autopsied lung showed markedly increased connective tissue around bronchi and blood vessels, in areas where microtubular adenocarcinoma was scattered. This is a very rare case of pulmonary metastasis of cholangiocellular carcinoma, associated with marked fibrotic change of the lungs during about 3.5 years. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case.",

        "content": "An autopsy case of SLE died from acute and diffuse pulmonary hemorrhage is presented. A 50 year-old woman with SLE was admitted to our hospital because of high fever, butterfly rash, discoid skin lesions and renal dysfunction. She died from acute respiratory failure before initiation of the therapy with corticosteroid. Autopsy findings revealed a massive acute intrapulmonary hemorrhage. Histological study demonstrated a pulmonary arterial vasculitis with prominent fibrinoid necrosis at muscular pulmonary artery. No remarkable deposit of immunoglobulins and complements was found within the alveolar walls and pulmonary vessels by immunofluorescence and electron microscopy. Renal histology revealed diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis with fibrinoid necrosis, crescent formation and wireloop lesions compatible with type IVb according to the WHO classification. The granular deposit of IgM, C3 and Clq, and electron dense deposit was found by immunofluorescence and by electron microscopy, respectively, in the kidney. The small arteries and veins in other organs, such as liver, spleen, bladder, ovary and rectum also revealed fibrinoid vasculitis. Acute infectious lesion was not observed in any tissue examined. The diffuse pulmonary hemorrhage in SLE could be one of the manifestations of active and severe systemic vasculitis.",

        "content": "We encountered a patient with multiple myeloma who died suddenly, in whom bilateral pulmonary artery thrombosis was found at autopsy. The patient was a 50-year-old woman who had received chemotherapy for multiple myeloma at a local clinic for 4 years, and was transferred to our hospital because of recurrence of multiple myeloma in August 1990. Despite chemotherapy performed after admission, serum globulin level increased and her low back pain worsened, and she was generally restricted to bed. On October 21, she developed sudden dyspnea, became markedly cyanotic, lost consciousness, and then suffered a cardiopulmonary arrest. Autopsy revealed bilateral pulmonary artery thrombosis as well as thrombosis in the pelvic veins. Hyperviscosity due to multiple myeloma and long-term recumbency were the probable causes of pelvic venous thrombosis and subsequent pulmonary artery thrombosis. We report a rare case of bilateral pulmonary artery thrombosis which developed during the course of multiple myeloma and led to sudden death.",

He complained of pain in the lower abdomen and loss of appetite. After the clinical examination, the doctors concluded that he was suffering from an acute episode of diverticulitis, and he received treatment for this condition. During the treatment, Nicolaescu's condition improved, but the intestinal transit was not functional and the blood work was still unsatisfactory. The doctors opted for an exploratory laparoscopy, which led to the discovery of an acute perforated appendicitis complicated with peritonitis. After undergoing surgery, Nicolaescu developed respiratory complications, leading to acute respiratory failure within 48 hours. He entered into cardiac arrest on 3 January 2013, and could not be resuscitated by the hospital staff. He was pronounced dead at 8:20 AM GMT+2.
