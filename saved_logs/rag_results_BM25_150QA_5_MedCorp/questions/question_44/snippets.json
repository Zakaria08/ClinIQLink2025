        "title": "[Familial outbreak of psittacosis].",
        "content": "Three familial cases of psittacosis are reported. The first case was a 46-year-old woman, the second case, her 18-year-old daughter. Both of them often visited the house of the third case, a 49-year-old women, who was the elder sister of case 1 and who took care of the chick of a budgerigar which she kept in the house. Case 1 came to our hospital with abrupt onset of fever, headache, nausea and general malaise. Because she was suspected to have meningitis, she was admitted to the Department of Neurology. On admission, her chest X-ray film showed bilateral ground glass shadows. She also had hypoxemia and liver dysfunction. On learning of her history of contact with the chick, psittacosis was suspected. Case 2 suffered from fever and headache. Her chest X-ray film revealed opaque infiltration in the right lower lung field. Case 3 complained of fever, headache and vomiting. Her chest X-ray film showed fan-shaped faint shadows in the left upper, middle and lower lung fields. We interpreted these findings as showing psittacosis based on anamnesis. The result of the complement fixation (CF) antibody titer against chlamydia was 1:32 in cases 2 and 3, enabling a serological diagnosis of psittacosis. The corresponding result was 1:16 in case 1. Although the CF antibody titer showed no increase, we diagnosed the case clinically as psittacosis. It is difficult to correctly diagnose psittacosis only from the physical findings and chest X-ray films. Detailed anamnesis, in particular taking a history of exposure to birds, is an important clue for diagnosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "content": "We report a case of recurrent tonsillitis and otitis media with effusion (OME) from which Chlamydia trachomatis was isolated. Chlamydia pneumoniae, a newly recognized species of Chlamydia, was also recovered from the tonsillar and bronchial swabs. A 8-year-old girl was seen on February 23, 1988, because of a running nose, a productive cough and bilateral hearing difficulty. She had a history of recurrent tonsillitis. The diagnosis was acute sinusitis with tubal obstruction, then cefixime was prescribed. Her symptoms were once resolved, for the time being but she came back to the hospital a week later with a bilateral ear-ache. The tympanic membranes were injected and characteristically retracted. Her left ear showed type B tympanogram (effusion). Tympanocentesis was performed to remove middle-ear effusion, from which C. trachomatis but no ordinary bacterium was isolated. Therefore rokitamycin 300 mg/day was administered for a week. Her condition improved, however, a rhinorrhea, a plugged ear sensation and a hacking cough returned in a month. She was admitted to the hospital on May 10, for tympanostomy and grommet insertion, but from the day before admission, she had a sore throat with fever (39.2 degrees C). The surgery was withheld until May 26. When adenotonsillectomy and grommets insertion were undertaken, C. trachomatis had disappeared from the middle-ear effusion, but C. pneumoniae was recovered from both tonsillar and bronchial swabs. Readministration of rokitamycin was performed and to date (June, 1990) she remains well.",

        "title": "[A case of pulmonary infiltration with eosinophilia (PIE) syndrome induced by Saiboku-To (TJ96). Detection of ECF activity in lymphocytes stimulated with TJ96].",
        "content": "A case of PIE syndrome induced by Saiboku-To (TJ96) is reported. A 56-year-old woman had been treated for intractable bronchial asthma since the age of 42 years. She had a history of PIE syndrome induced by disodium cromoglycate 4 years previously (Jpn. J. Thoracic Disease, 27.1.1989). To reduce the dose of prednisolone for her asthma, administration of TJ96 was started in Dec. 1989. After 5 months of TJ96 treatment, she developed dry cough, fever, and chest pain. Physical findings and laboratory examinations revealed pulmonary infiltrations in the right lung field and severe eosinophilia. Because of suspected drug-induced PIE, TJ96 was stopped and 30 mg/day prednisolone was administered. Her symptoms and laboratory abnormalities subsequently resolved. To confirm the diagnosis of drug-induced PIE syndrome, drug-induced lymphocyte stimulation tests with TJ96 and other drugs were performed. TJ96 significantly induced lymphocyte blastogenesis with a stimulation index of 6.1. Moreover, the supernatant of the incubation mixture of TJ96 and peripheral lymphocytes from the patient showed marked eosinophil chemotactic activity. To our knowledge, there has been no previous report of PIE syndrome induced by TJ96. In addition, this is the first report of the detection of ECF activity in lymphocytes induced by an offending drug in vitro.",
