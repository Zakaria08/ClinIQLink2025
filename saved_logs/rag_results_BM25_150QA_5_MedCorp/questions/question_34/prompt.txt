Document 1 (Title: Epidemiologic and clinical aspects of animal bite injuries.): During 1975, 332 animal bite injuries accounted for 1.2% of all surgical problems treated at the UCLA Hospital Emergency Department. Data on 307 bite injuries were available and analyzed for environmental, animal, human, interaction, and clinical factors. More than half of the dog bites and almost three fourths of the cat bites-scratches happened at or near the victims' homes. Dog bites were almost twice as common among men, while cat bites-scratches were twice as common among women. Of the incidents in which ownership information was available, 85% of dog bites and 80% of cat bites-scratches were from an animal belonging to the victim, his family or friends, or another known person. Forty-three percent of dog bites, and 52% of cat bites-scratches were provoked, that is, happened while the victim was interacting with the animal. Of bites of the head and/or neck, 38% injured the upper lip; 17% of dog bites injured the eye or adjacent tissues; 48% were in children less than ten-years-old. On fifth of cat bites-scratches involved the head and/or neck, 60% of these injured orbital or periorbital tissues. Over 2% of patients were hospitalized. Five percent of dog bite victims and 29% of cat bite-scratch victims returned with complications, mostly cellulitis or lymphangitis. Pasteurella multocida was the most common pathogen cultured, as evidenced by the 50% and 80% culture-positive rates for dog and cat bite-scratches respectively in this series.
Document 2 (Title: Dog bite): The behavior of a dog may not always indicate its friendliness or unlikelihood of biting. This is because when a dog wags its tail, most people interpret this as the dog expressing happiness and friendliness. Though indeed tail wagging can express these positive emotions, tail wagging is also an indication of fear, insecurity, anxiety, challenging of dominance, establishing social relationships or a warning that the dog may bite. Treatment When a person receives a dog bite where the skin is broken, the risk of a serious infection can be reduced by cleaning the wound and getting appropriate health care treatment. It is important to find out if the dog's rabies vaccinations are current. A Cochrane review found that there is not much evidence for or against current practices of keeping dog bite wounds being left open to heal for a short time before closure (delayed closure) or not stitched at all (no closure) over immediate closure by stitching.
Document 3 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): In the United States, dogs bite >4.7 million people each year and are responsible for 80% of all animal-bite wounds, an estimated 15–20% of which become infected. Each year, 800,000 Americans seek medical attention for dog bites; of those injured, 386,000 require treatment in an emergency department, with >1000 emergency department visits each day and about a dozen deaths per year. Most dog bites are provoked and are inflicted by the victim’s pet or by a dog known to the victim. These bites are frequently sustained during efforts to break up a dogfight. Children are more likely than adults to sustain canine bites, with the highest incidence of 6 bites/1000 population among boys 5–9 years old. Victims are more often male than female, and bites most often involve an upper extremity. Among children <4 years old, two-thirds of all these injuries involve the head or neck. Infection typically manifests 8–24 h after the bite as pain at the site of injury with cellulitis accompanied by

Special consideration should be paid to puncture wounds in areas like the hands, which have multiple small compartments. Some groups have found that as long as wounds are properly irrigated and cleansed with povidone iodine solution while a short course of antibiotics is prescribed, there is no difference in infection rates in dog bite wounds closed primarily.62Rabies in domestic animals in the United States is rare, and most cases are contracted from bat bites. In developing countries, dog bites remain the most common source of rabies. Management of this is beyond the scope of this
Document 5 (Title: Three Stories (House)): At the lecture, House presents three cases of patients with leg pain to the students. The three stories are intercut with each other; the following summary presents each case in chronological order. The first patient is a farmer who appears to have been bitten by a snake. Foreman and Chase visit the man's farm and find a timber rattlesnake. However, the farmer suffers an allergic reaction to the anti-venom and a test of the snake’s venom sac indicates that it did not recently bite anyone. The patient continues to decline, and when House informs him he is dying, he asks what will happen to his dog. House then realizes that the farmer was bitten by his dog, and bacteria from its mouth caused necrotizing fasciitis. The dog is euthanized and the farmer’s leg is amputated, but he survives.

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
Question: A 27-year-old man presents to the emergency department after a dog bite. The patient was intoxicated and pulled the dog’s tail while it was eating. The dog belongs to his friend and is back at his friend’s house currently. Physical exam is notable for a dog bite on the patient’s right arm. The wound is irrigated and explored with no retained bodies found. A tetanus vaccination is administered. Which of the following is appropriate management of this patient?
Options:
A. Administer amoxicillin-clavulanic acid
B. Administer trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole
C. Close the wound with sutures and discharge the patient
D. Discharge the patient with outpatient follow up
