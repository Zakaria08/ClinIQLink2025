History It is commonly referred to as the Australia Antigen. This is because it was first isolated by the American research physician and Nobel Prize winner Baruch S. Blumberg in the serum of an Australian Aboriginal person. It was discovered to be part of the virus that caused serum hepatitis by virologist Alfred Prince in 1968. Heptavax, a \"first-generation\" hepatitis B vaccine in the 1980s, was made from HBsAg extracted from the blood plasma of hepatitis patients. Current vaccine are made from recombinant HBsAg grown in yeast. See also HBcAg HBeAg References Viral structural proteins Hepatitis B virus Antigens",

Hepatitis D Hepatitis D is caused by the hepatitis D virus (HDV), or hepatitis delta virus; it belongs to the genus Deltavirus. It is similar to a satellite virus as it can only propagate in the presence of the hepatitis B virus, depending on the helper function of HBV for its replication and expression. It has no independent life cycle, but can survive and replicate as long as HBV infection persists in the host body. It can only cause infection when encapsulated by hepatitis B virus surface antigens. The vaccine for hepatitis B protects against hepatitis D virus because of the latter's dependence on the presence of hepatitis B virus for it to replicate. Hepatitis E",

DHBV is a small DNA virus with a diameter of 40\u201345 nm. The viral envelope is made up from host cell lipid, with viral surface antigens (DHBsAg). The icosahedral nucleocapsid within, is composed of the virus core antigen (DHBcAg) and surrounds the DNA genome and viral polymerase. The viral genome is a circular double stranded DNA molecule about 3000 base pairs long. The genome has three overlapping open reading frames or ORFs: C-ORF \u2013 encoding the core antigen and pre-core protein which are processed and secreted as DHBcAg S-ORF \u2013 codes for the surface antigen DHBsAg P-ORF \u2013 encoding the viral polymerase. On binding and entry of the virus to the host cell, the genome is transported to the nucleus to be transcribed. Novel viral RNA is then transferred to the cytoplasm for translation and subsequent protein synthesis.",
