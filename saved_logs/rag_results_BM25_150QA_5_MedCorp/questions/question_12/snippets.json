        "content": "We report a case of \"steroid and immunosuppressant-resistant\" polymyositis that was successfully treated with immunoadsorption. A 46-year-old man was admitted to Shinshu University Hospital on June 2, 1989, with the chief complaint of muscle weakness and pain. He had a 1.5-year history of frequent episodes of Raynaud's phenomenon. Five months before presentation, he noticed muscle weakness and pain in the proximal muscles of his extremities. One month after the onset of these symptoms, his body temperature increased to 38 degrees C and remained elevated until the following month. He subsequently entered a local hospital. He was found to have diminished strength in all limbs that was more marked in the proximal areas. The muscle weakness and pain progressed until the patient was no longer able to walk. Muscle biopsy of the left quadriceps femoris showed mononuclear cell infiltration in the endomyosium that was accompanied by phagocytosis and interstitial fibrosis. Based on these findings, a diagnosis of polymyositis was made. During hospitalization, the weakness continued to worsen despite pulse therapy with methylprednisolone 1000 mg per day for 3 days and the administration of prednisolone 100 mg and azathioprine 100 mg per day. The patient was transferred to our hospital for further evaluation and treatment. On physical examination, he demonstrated hair loss, soft palate aphthae, tonsillar injection, and cervical lymphadenopathy. Neurological examination revealed generalized weakness; the patient was barely able to move all of his limbs. All of the muscles in his extremities were swollen and hard, and he felt pain when they were grasped. Deep tendon reflexes were diffusely hypoactive.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "title": "Nonlanguage disorders of speech reflect complex neurologic apparatus.",
        "content": "The mute or nearly mute patient who is alert and has good understanding of speech and a right hemiparesis could have Broca's aphasia, akinesia of speech (transcortical motor aphasia), or aphemia. The patient who has Broca's aphasia does not write well, and his speech does not improve greatly with repetition. The speech of a patient with akinesia of speech improves with repetition. The aphemic patient writes normally, but his speech does not improve with repetition. The mute patient whose eyes are open but who is poorly responsive and moves little or not at all could be an akinetic mute (with either a cingulate or a thalamomesencephalic lesion) or have a locked-in syndrome. The latter is diagnosed by asking the patient to look up and down or to open and close his eyes. If he obeys these commands, the physician questions him using a code of eye movement responses. If the patient fails to respond at all, he is an akinetic mute; intense stimulation may result in speech or movement. If the patient is drowsy and has third nerve involvement, the lesion is in the thalamomesencephalic reticular formation. If the patient appears alert and has episodes of agitation, he probably has bilateral lesions in the gyri cinguli. Patients with weakness of the bulbar musculature (facial, palatal, and tongue weakness and dysphonia) may have either upper motor neuron or lower motor neuron lesions. Only bilateral upper motor neuron lesions produce permanent dysarthria. As a typical example, a patient has a transient left hemiparesis with dysarthria and almost completely recovers. Later, however, a right hemiparesis develops and the patient experiences severe bilateral facial weakness, drooling, dysphagia, and severe dysarthria. The absence of atrophy of the bulbar musculature, a hyperactive jaw jerk and gag reflex and, sometimes, inappropriate laughing or crying episodes indicate that the lesion is located above the medulla in the corticobulbar tracts. Flaccid paralysis, absence of the jaw jerk or gag reflex, and absence of other upper motor neuron signs, such as upgoing toes, indicate a lower motor neuron or neuromuscular junction problem. Appropriate tests to rule out myasthenia gravis should be done. The other conditions discussed here are often obvious from their clinical presentation. Although the specific disorder of speech sometimes is helpful in localizing the cause, in most patients, the associated deficits on neurologic examination are of greatest value.",

        "title": "[A case of flexion myelopathy presenting juvenile segmental muscular atrophy of upper extremities--a successful treatment by cervical spine immobilization].",
        "content": "A 24-year-old man was well until 1982, when he noticed weakness and atrophy of right arm especially those of biceps muscles. These symptoms did not progress until 1988. In 1988 weakness of left elbow flexion appeared and he was admitted to our hospital. On examination, he had weakness and atrophy of both upper extremities. Fasciculation was noticed in the proximal part of right arm. When his head was bent forward, dysesthesia appeared around radial side of his arm. There were no long tract sign or objective sensory loss. EMG showed neurogenic change over both his upper extremities. In plain cervical roentgenogram there existed abnormal kyphosis of cervical vertebrae. In MRI imaged with his neck flexed, cervical cord was compressed by the posterior surface of 4th cervical vertebral body, which corresponded to the top of cervical kyphosis. Based on these signs and examinations, a diagnosis of flexion myelopathy was made. Spinal immobilization by wiring and bone graft implantation ranging from C2 to C6 was performed to limit the range of anterior nuchal flexion. After this operation, improvement of muscle strength along with the disappearance of dysesthesia on neck flexion was observed. Clinically, this case closely resembles to juvenile type of distal and segmental muscular atrophy of upper extremities (Hirayama type). From our study, pathomechanism of this case seems to be a flexion myelopathy at C4 level. This view is supported also by the good recovery after the operation. This case suggests that nonprogressive atrophy of upper extremities due to flexion myelopathy can be successfully treated by cervical spine immobilization.",

        "content": "His physical exam revealed clear lungs and a normal heart exam on auscultation. His abdomen was soft and non-tender, and his skin was warm and dry with no rash. He had 2 plus pitting edema at the ankles. Initial laboratory data was consistent with acute kidney injury (AKI) with worsening creatinine from 1.2 to 1.6 over 1 month and nephrotic range proteinuria. Serologies for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, anti-nuclear antibody (ANA), c-ANCA, serine protease 3 (PR3) IgG, myeloperoxidase antibody (MPO), and complement levels were sent. He was started on losartan for proteinuria with plans for renal biopsy; however, he was lost to follow up. The patient then presented two weeks later with worsening edema to his waist, continued weight gain, mild hemoptysis, and streaks of blood in the stool. Physical examination now showed worsening pitting edema up to his waist with new non-pruritic, erythematous excoriations on the medial aspect of his thighs bilaterally. He was admitted to the hospital with concern for worsening vasculitis. He was started on oral prednisone and underwent a renal biopsy. For his edema, he was started on diuretics to which he responded well. Due to persistent leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing was performed to complete the workup.",
