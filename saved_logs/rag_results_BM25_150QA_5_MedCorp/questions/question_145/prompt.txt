Document 1 (Title: Dimercaprol): Dimercaprol, also called British anti-Lewisite (BAL), is a medication used to treat acute poisoning by arsenic, mercury, gold, and lead. It may also be used for antimony, thallium, or bismuth poisoning, although the evidence for those uses is not very strong. It is given by injection into a muscle. Common side effects include high blood pressure, pain at the site of the injection, vomiting, and fever. It is not recommended for people with peanut allergies as it is typically formulated as a suspension in peanut oil. It is unclear if use in pregnancy is safe for the baby. Dimercaprol is a chelator and works by binding with heavy metals. It has a very, pungent odor. Dimercaprol was first made during World War II. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines.
Document 2 (Title: Arsenic distribution in rabbits after Lewisite administration and treatment with British anti-Lewisite (BAL).): The standard treatment of Lewisite (dichloro(2-chlorovinyl)arsine) poisoning is by chelation with BAL (British anti-Lewisite, dimercaptopropanol). The present study investigated the effect of BAL treatment on the distribution of arsenic after Lewisite administration. Lewisite was administered subcutaneously at the LD10 and LD40 of the compound. Without BAL treatment arsenic was eliminated with a half-life in blood of between 55 and 75 hr and a blood clearance of 120 ml/hr/kg. Arsenic had a large volume of distribution of several liters per kilogram, indicating extensive distribution in tissues. The highest tissue concentrations, more than seven times blood concentrations, were found in the liver, lung, and kidneys. These organs maintained an approximately constant concentration ratio with blood during the sampling period. Concentrations in tissues with a blood-to-tissue barrier, such as the brain and the spinal cord, rose between 4 and 96 hr while blood concentrations declined more than fourfold over the same time period. BAL treatment by four equal, maximally tolerated doses over 12 hr substantially reduced arsenic concentrations in blood and tissues. For example, at 24 hr the concentrations in brain and liver (target organs for arsenic toxicity) were reduced by 65 to 89% over the range of Lewisite doses administered. The total exposure of brain and spinal cord was reduced by more than two-thirds by BAL treatment. Further, the blood clearance of arsenic was increased. BAL treatment enhanced the elimination of arsenic in two ways: by decreasing the tissue-to-blood partitioning which mobilizes arsenic into the blood stream, and by increasing the clearance of arsenic.
Document 3 (Title: Dimercaprol -- Indications): In 1940, Sir Rudolph Albert Peters’ group at the University of Oxford, UK, developed dimercaprol (2,3-dimercapto-1-propanol), also known as British anti-Lewisite (BAL), as an antidote to lewisite, the arsenical chemical weapon used during World War II. [1] Shortly after its development, dimercaprol was also found to be just as effective for other metals such as mercury, gold, lead, and copper.
Document 4 (Title: Evaluation of the efficacy of dimercapto chelating agents for the treatment of systemic organic arsenic poisoning in rabbits.): 1 The standard drug for the treatment of arsenic poisoning is BAL (dimercaprol). BAL possesses marked side-effects and a low safety ratio, drawbacks which new BAL analogues, DMPS and DMSA, do not possess. 2 The efficacy of three chelating agents, BAL, DMPS and DMSA, has been evaluated as a treatment for systemic organic arsenic poisoning, induced by intravenous dichloro(2-chlorovinyl)arsine (lewisite) administration to rabbits. Equimolar dosing schedules were used based upon realistic doses for the most toxic agent, BAL. 3 It was concluded that all three dimercapto chelating agents provided significant protection against the lethal systemic effects of lewisite, and, under the test conditions reported here, there was no significant difference between them in therapeutic efficacy. 4 The cause of mortality following intravenous lewisite in treated and untreated rabbits was pulmonary damage. 5 It is considered that DMPS and DMSA are worthy of further study as replacements for BAL in the treatment of systemic poisoning by lewisite.
Document 5 (Title: Treating exposure to chemical warfare agents: implications for health care providers and community emergency planning.): Current treatment protocols for exposure to nerve and vesicant agents found in the U.S. stockpile of unitary chemical weapons are summarized, and the toxicities of available antidotes are evaluated. The status of the most promising of the new nerve agent antidotes is reviewed. In the U.S. atropine and pralidoxime compose the only approved antidote regimen for organophosphate nerve agent poisoning. Diazepam may also be used if necessary to control convulsions. To avoid death, administration must occur within minutes of substantial exposure together with immediate decontamination. Continuous observation and repeated administration of antidotes are necessary as symptoms warrant. Available antidotes do not necessarily prevent respiratory failure or incapacitation. The toxicity of the antidotes themselves and the individualized nature of medical care preclude recommending that autoinjectors be distributed to the general public. In addition, precautionary administration of protective drugs to the general population would not be feasible or desirable. No antidote exists for poisoning by the vesicant sulfur mustard (H, HD, HT); effective intervention can only be accomplished by rapid decontamination followed by palliative treatment of symptoms. British anti-Lewisite (BAL) (2,3-dimercapto-1-propanolol) is the antidote of choice for treatment of exposure to Lewisite, another potent vesicant. Experimental water-soluble BAL analogues have been developed that are less toxic than BAL. Treatment protocols for each antidote are summarized in tabular form for use by health care providers.
