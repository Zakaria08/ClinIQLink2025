With your own knowledge and the help of the following document:

Document 1 (Title: Identifying and Addressing Bullying -- History and Physical): Primary care clinicians are often asked to evaluate children for learning or behavior problems, including possible ADHD. An example is a teen boy who previously was a strong student, active in sports, and a musician in the school band who presents with declining grades. The teacher questions attention issues since he no longer completes his homework and says he "forgets to do it."  Further questioning reveals that a classmate has been confronting him daily after school, grabbing his backpack and dumping its contents. Therefore, he leaves his bag in his locker to avoid these unpleasant encounters and no longer finishes or turns in his assignments. He will not require an educational or psychiatric evaluation for ADHD once the clinician identifies that bullying is the underlying cause of his declining grades.
Document 2 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): Christian Lüscher, MD A 15-year-old high school student is brought to the emergency department after his parents found him in his room staring at the ceiling and visibly frightened. Earlier that evening, he attended a party but was depressed because his girlfriend just broke up with him. Jerry is failing this year at school and has stopped playing soccer. His parents are also worried about a change in his behavior over the last few months. He has lost interest in school, at times seems depressed, and tells his par-ents that his pocket money is not sufficient. When questioned by the intern, he reports that space-cookies were served at the party. He also says that smoking marijuana has become a habit (three to four joints a week) but denies consumption of alcohol and other drugs. How do you explain the state he was found in? What is the difference between hashish and marijuana? What may be the link to his poor performance at school? Are all drug users necessarily using several drugs?
Document 3 (Title: Working through conflict with self-destructive preschool children.): This case history charts the treatment of a preschooler who first presented at the age of three years and ten months with aggressive and self-destructive behaviors. During the initial months of treatment, the therapist focused upon establishing a therapeutic alliance with the child in order to evoke a transference reaction. Compelling evidence of the transference in this case occurred in the ninth month of treatment when the therapist told the child that she would be going on vacation. The child, whose own mother had abandoned him several times, responded with uncharacteristic physical and verbal abuse. Although the child engaged in aggressive and self-destructive play enactments almost from the onset of treatment, these behaviors intensified from the fifth month of treatment onwards, as it became evident that he had entered the working-through phase. Aggressive impulses were shown in his manipulation of toys and other objects, and self-destructive episodes emerged in the child's incessant efforts to jump from chairs and tables, as well as in repeated threats to "shoot" himself with a toy gun. The therapist was sensitive to the child's need to continually repeat and gradually modify these behaviors. She permitted their display without exhibiting shock or alarm, but at the same time, expressed concern for the child's safety and reinforced this concern by setting limits on his unacceptable behavior. Gradually, the child's self-destructive and aggressive tendencies abated. Further evidence that the conflict had been worked through was also seen in the child's ability to express a more realistic assessment of his home environment, one which reconciled the conflict between "good" and "bad" impulses. This advancement in perception was demonstrated by the child's verbal recognition that while his mother was capable of doing "bad" things, she was still his mother and he loved her. Prior to the termination of treatment, both the child's grandmother and teachers reported significant improvement in the child's behavior and linguistic abilities.
Document 4 (Title: Pennsylvania Child Abuse Recognition and Reporting -- Pearls and Other Issues -- A 16-year-old child presents to the emergency department due to acting out at school. Shortly after arrival, the child asks for a sandwich. The school could not reach the biological mother, and the biological father is deceased. The child indicates his mother is on a honeymoon on a boat somewhere in the Cayman Islands. He is currently being taken care of by his grandmother, who is at work as a dietician, but she will be home shortly. The mother left him with $200 ten days ago and told him to buy local fast food for both of them for dinner. He admits he was told not to spend more than $20 daily and avoid dessert due to his grandmother's diabetes. He says he is out of money because he bought dessert daily and spent $30 instead of $20. He says he is "starving." There is no food in the house besides the fruits, vegetables, and frozen meals his mother provided. Which of the following would be an appropriate response of the emergency department health providers?): The child should be given food, and the grandmother should be contacted. Additionally, while there may not be reasonable cause to suspect child abuse, the PA CPSL prescribes that a person, hospital, institution, school, facility, agency, or agency employee acting in good faith shall have immunity from civil and criminal liability that might otherwise result from making a report of suspected child abuse or making a referral for general protective services, regardless of whether the report is required to be made under the PA CPSL. General concerns for a child's safety, health, and well-being may be reported to ChildLine for assessment of services and support.
Document 5 (Title: Adlerian Therapy -- Introduction -- Historical Context): In the early 1900s, Adler became an imperative figure in the history of psychotherapy. He was an initial supporter and fellow of Sigmund Freud, who invited Adler to collaborate with the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society, where he served as leader and co-editor. During this time, his work focused on abnormal human behavior and appeared psychoanalytic. After some time, Adler elaborated his hypotheses on the nature of humankind, which caused significant theoretical disagreement with Freud. Following his ideology, he disclosed a novel doctrine and practice of counseling that emerged as a unification of cognitive, existential-humanistic, systemic, and psychodynamic viewpoints. He reaffirmed his theories during World War I by serving his country as a military doctor. This experience profoundly affected him. [1] As a result, Adler became more interested in standard human behavior, allowing him to establish several child guidance clinics in Vienna. For this reason, he developed a relatively small but significant following. His therapeutic methods became more encouragement-focused after the war, emphasizing human strengths and abilities. This postwar advisory technique was the fundamental basis of Adlerian psychotherapy. In 1935, Adler sought refuge in the United States with a hypothesis about a community of social equals. Although he taught and lectured extensively in the United States, his followers found substantial resistance from those who adopted Freud's psychoanalysis. [4]
