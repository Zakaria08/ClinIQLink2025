        "content": "More frequent Pap smears may be needed to follow up after an abnormal Pap smear, after treatment for abnormal Pap or biopsy results, or after treatment of cancer ( cervical, colon, etc ). Effectiveness The Pap test, when combined with a regular program of screening and appropriate follow-up, can reduce cervical cancer deaths by up to 80%. Failure of prevention of cancer by the Pap test can occur for many reasons, including not getting regular screening, lack of appropriate follow-up of abnormal results, and sampling and interpretation errors. In the US, over half of all invasive cancers occur in females who have never had a Pap smear; an additional 10 to 20% of cancers occur in those who have not had a Pap smear in the preceding five years. About one-quarter of US cervical cancers were in people who had an abnormal Pap smear but did not get appropriate follow-up (patient did not return for care, or clinician did not perform recommended tests or treatment).",

        "content": "In 1928, Papanikolaou told an incredulous audience of physicians about the noninvasive technique of gathering cellular debris from the lining of the vaginal tract and smearing it on a glass slide for microscopic examination as a way to identify cervical cancer. That year, he had undertaken a study of vaginal fluid in women, in hopes of observing cellular changes over the course of a menstrual cycle. In female guinea pigs, Papanicolaou had already noticed cell transformation and wanted to corroborate the phenomenon in human females. It happened that one of Papanicolaou's human subjects was suffering from uterine cancer. Upon examination of a slide made from a smear of the patient's vaginal fluid, Papanicolaou discovered that abnormal cancer cells could be plainly observed under a microscope. \"The first observation of cancer cells in the smear of the uterine cervix,\" he later wrote, \"gave me one of the greatest thrills I ever experienced during my scientific career.\"",

Mortality was increased compared with the general population. A family with sinonasal polyposis were followed up for 28 years. Two cases of sinonasal type adenocarcinoma developed.

        "content": "Although hyperkeratosis is a common cytological finding on Papanicolaou smear, its clinical significance is unclear. A profile of patients with hyperkeratosis was constructed by comparing them to an age-matched control population having normal Papanicolaou smears. The clinical significance of hyperkeratosis was evaluated and appropriate follow-up studies were recommended. Of 2198 Papanicolaou smears done in the University of Kansas Family Practice Department between October 1, 1988, and October 31, 1989, there were 184 diagnoses of hyperkeratosis from smears on which no other pathological findings were noted. Charts of 183 of these patients with hyperkeratosis were reviewed and compared with an age-matched control population having normal Papanicolaou smears. Patients with hyperkeratosis had a statistically higher incidence of infections with Gardnerella vaginalis, but a lower incidence of infections with Chlamydia trachomatis. Diaphragm use was more prevalent in the group with hyperkeratosis. The incidence of inflammation on Papanicolaou smear was similar between the two groups. Of the patients with hyperkeratosis, colposcopic examination had been performed on 48% (88 of 183), of which 28% (25 of 88) had evidence of human papillomavirus or dysplasia. Review of the data obtained suggests that follow-up colposcopy, including endocervical curettage, be performed on all patients with hyperkeratosis in order to screen for accompanying pathological conditions that may necessitate treatment.",
