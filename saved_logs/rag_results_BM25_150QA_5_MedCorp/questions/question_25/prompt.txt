With your own knowledge and the help of the following document:

Document 1 (Title: Porphyria cutanea tarda): Patients who are diagnosed with PCT typically seek treatment following the development of photosensitivities causing blisters and erosions on exposed areas of the skin. This is usually observed in the face, hands, forearms, and lower legs. Healing is slow and leaves scarring. Though blisters are the most common skin manifestations of PCT, other skin manifestations include hyperpigmentation (similar to a tan) and hypertrichosis (mainly on the cheeks) also occur. PCT is a chronic condition, with external symptoms often subsiding and recurring as a result of multiple factors. In addition to the skin lesions, chronic liver disease is very common in patients with sporadic PCT. This involves hepatic fibrosis (scarring of the liver), and inflammation. However, liver problems are less common in patients with the inherited form of the disease. Additionally, patients will often void a wine-red color urine with an increased concentration of uroporphyrin I due to their enzymatic deficiency.
Document 2 (Title: Basal cell carcinoma and breast carcinoma following repeated fluoroscopic examinations of the chest.): A 69-year-old white Italian woman was first seen at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in 1981 concerning several skin growths on her back. The patient had had several basal cell carcinomas surgically removed from her back during the preceding 5 years. There was no history of arsenic ingestion or prolonged sun exposure and her family history was negative for skin cancer. The patient had developed pulmonary tuberculosis in 1938 and was treated with pneumothorax therapy. She had had more than 50 fluoroscopic examinations of the chest following this therapy, as well as multiple diagnostic x-ray films since that time. She recalled that she had faced the fluoroscopy beam during the procedure. In 1959, she had a transabdominal hysterectomy for fibroid tumors. In 1980 she underwent a right modified radical mastectomy for adenoid cystic carcinoma of the breast; biopsies of lymph nodes were negative. Physical examination revealed a thin, white woman with a right mastectomy scar. On the back, clustered in the interscapular region, were multiple scars and nine erythematous nodules with pearly borders, telangiectasia, and translucent surfaces. Within several nodules there were areas of light and dark brown pigmentation. There were no other suspicious lesions on the head, chest, or extremities, nor did the patient show any evidence of the basal cell nevus syndrome. Biopsy of all lesions revealed basal cell carcinoma, some of which were pigmented, without evidence of chronic radiodermatitis. All lesions were treated with curettage and electrodesiccation three times with good cosmetic results (Fig. 1).
Document 3 (Title: Porphyria): Vesiculo-erosive skin disease. This—a reference to the characteristic blistering (vesicles) and open sores (erosions) noted in patients—is the pattern seen in CEP, PCT, VP, and HCP. The changes are noted only in sun-exposed areas such as the face and back of the hands. Milder skin disease, such as that seen in VP and HCP, consists of increased skin fragility in exposed areas with a tendency to form blisters and erosions, particularly after minor knocks or scrapes. These heal slowly, often leaving small scars that may be lighter or darker than normal skin. More severe skin disease is sometimes seen in PCT, with prominent lesions, darkening of exposed skin such as the face, and hypertrichosis: abnormal hair growth on the face, particularly the cheeks. The most severe disease is seen in CEP and a rare variant of PCT known as hepatoerythropoietic porphyria (HEP); symptoms include severe shortening of digits, loss of skin appendages such as hair and nails, and severe scarring of the skin
Document 4 (Title: Hand, foot, and mouth disease): Signs and symptoms Common constitutional signs and symptoms of the HFMD include fever, nausea, vomiting, feeling tired, generalized discomfort, loss of appetite, and irritability in infants and toddlers. Skin lesions frequently develop in the form of a rash of flat discolored spots and bumps which may be followed by vesicular sores with blisters on palms of the hands, soles of the feet, buttocks, and sometimes on the lips. The rash is rarely itchy for children, but can be extremely itchy for adults. Painful facial ulcers, blisters, or lesions may also develop in or around the nose or mouth. HFMD usually resolves on its own after 7–10 days. Most cases of the disease are relatively harmless, but complications including encephalitis, meningitis, and paralysis that mimics the neurological symptoms of polio can occur.
Document 5 (Title: [McArdle's disease without typical symptoms].): A 25-year-old female with McArdle's disease was reported. She had no characteristic symptoms for McArdle's disease such as muscle cramp and brown urine, but had general fatiguability from childhood. On examination, she showed no neurological abnormalities including muscle atrophy and weakness. On laboratory examination, serum creatinine kinase (CK) level was elevated, though serum lactic acid level remained unchanged after the ischemic forearm exercise test. Muscle biopsy from the biceps brachii showed almost completely absent phosphorylase activity both histochemically and biochemically. Thus, she was diagnosed as having McArdle's disease. The skinned fiber test of the muscle showed no enhanced Ca induced Ca release (CICR), and serum VLDL level was normal. Her 27-year-old elder brother had similar clinical symptoms and serological abnormalities and may also have McArdle's disease, although muscle biopsy was not performed. A possibility of McArdle's disease should be considered when we encounter a patient who has only general fatigue and high serum CK level.

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
Question: A 48-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of a photosensitive blistering rash on her hands, forearms, and face for 3 weeks. The lesions are not itchy. She has also noticed that her urine has been dark brown in color recently. Twenty years ago, she was successfully treated for Coats disease of the retina via retinal sclerotherapy. She is currently on hormonal replacement therapy for perimenopausal symptoms. Her aunt and sister have a history of a similar skin lesions. Examination shows multiple fluid-filled blisters and oozing erosions on the forearms, dorsal side of both hands, and forehead. There is hyperpigmented scarring and patches of bald skin along the sides of the blisters. Laboratory studies show a normal serum ferritin concentration. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management to induce remission in this patient?
Options:
A. Pursue liver transplantation
B. Begin oral thalidomide therapy
C. Begin phlebotomy therapy
D. Begin oral hydroxychloroquine therapy
