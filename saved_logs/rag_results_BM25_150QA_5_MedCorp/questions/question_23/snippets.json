        "content": "Diagnosis Conventionally, a leukocytosis exceeding 50,000 WBC/mm3 with a significant increase in early neutrophil precursors is referred to as a leukemoid reaction. The peripheral blood smear may show myelocytes, metamyelocytes, promyelocytes, and rarely myeloblasts; however, there is a mixture of early mature neutrophil precursors, in contrast to the immature forms typically seen in acute leukemia. Serum leukocyte alkaline phosphatase is normal or elevated in leukemoid reaction, but is depressed in chronic myelogenous leukemia. The bone marrow in a leukemoid reaction, if examined, may be hypercellular but is otherwise typically unremarkable.",

        "title": "Eosinophilia",
        "content": "Diagnosis is by complete blood count (CBC). However, in some cases, a more accurate absolute eosinophil count may be needed. Medical history is taken, with emphasis on travel, allergies and drug use. Specific test for causative conditions are performed, often including chest x-ray, urinalysis, liver and kidney function tests, and serologic tests for parasitic and connective tissue diseases. The stool is often examined for traces of parasites (i.e. eggs, larvae, etc.) though a negative test does not rule out parasitic infection; for example, trichinosis requires a muscle biopsy. Elevated serum B12 or low white blood cell alkaline phosphatase, or leukocytic abnormalities in a peripheral smear indicates a disorder of myeloproliferation. In cases of idiopathic eosinophilia, the patient is followed for complications. A brief trial of corticosteroids can be diagnostic for allergic causes, as the eosinophilia should resolve with suppression of the immune over-response. Neoplastic disorders",

        "content": "Basophilia can be detected through a complete blood count (CBC). The root cause of basophilia can be determined through a bone marrow biopsy, genetic testing to look for genetic mutations, or ultrasound to determine enlargement of the spleen. A bone marrow aspirate may be utilized to confirm an increase in basophils or significantly high numbers of precursors to the granulocytes. Since basophilia is present in a vast range of clinical conditions, depending on a variety of underlying causes, supplemental signs and symptoms must be investigated for a diagnosis. If splenomegaly is detected, a myeloproliferative syndrome may be suspected. Intrinsically related symptoms such as fever, malaise, pruritus (itching) due to the release of histamine, fatigue, and right upper quadrant pain may be present in the afflicted patient. With some conditions, such as polycythemia vera, erythromelalgia, or burning of the palms and soles, coupled with thrombocytosis is common. This severe symptomatology",

        "content": "Leukemoid reactions are generally benign and are not dangerous in and of themselves, although they are often a response to a significant disease state (see Causes above). However, leukemoid reactions can resemble more serious conditions such as chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), which can present with identical findings on the peripheral blood smear. Historically, various clues including the leukocyte alkaline phosphatase score and the presence of basophilia were used to distinguish CML from a leukemoid reaction. However, at present the test of choice in adults to distinguish CML is an assay for the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome, either via cytogenetics and FISH, or via PCR for the BCR/ABL fusion gene. The LAP (Leukocyte Alkaline Phosphatase) score is high in reactive states but is low in CML. In cases where the diagnosis is uncertain, a qualified hematologist or oncologist should be consulted.",

        "content": "A 53-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital on Nov. 16, 1987, because of general fatigue. On admission, she had hepatosplenomegaly and her peripheral blood profile showed a white blood cell count (WBC) of 309 x 10(3)/microliters with immature neutrophils, a hemoglobin level (Hb) of 7.6 g/dl, platelet count (PLT) of 536 x 10(3)/microliters, neutrophilic alkaline phosphatase (NAP) score of 44. Both Vitamin B12 and LDH levels were high. The bone marrow showed marked myeloid hyperplasia. In a cytogenetic study, Ph1 was found in 3 of 8 metaphases and Ph1 with an additional abnormality of 8 trisomy was noted in 5 of 8 metaphases. She was diagnosed as having chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and treated by i.m. injection of interferon (IFN)-alpha at a daily dose of 6 x 10(6) U. Administration of IFN-alpha induced fever for a few days. WBC, PLT count and LDH level gradually decreased, and the NAP score and hepatosplenomegaly improved. She achieved remission in February, 1988. Administration of IFN-alpha was stopped in April, 1988, when the bone marrow showed hypocellularity and normal karyotype. She was treated with 20 mg of prednisolone daily from May until August, because of progressive pancytopenia. She had received no treatment until July, 1989. In May, 1989, the bone marrow again showed myeloid hyperplasia and Ph1 was found in all cells analyzed. Therefore, we resumed IFN-alpha treatment. It is interesting that remission of CML continues for more than one year after discontinuation of IFN-alpha in this case.",
