Document 1 (Title: Ceftriaxone): Ceftriaxone, sold under the brand name Rocephin, is a third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic used for the treatment of a number of bacterial infections. These include middle ear infections, endocarditis, meningitis, pneumonia, bone and joint infections, intra-abdominal infections, skin infections, urinary tract infections, gonorrhea, and pelvic inflammatory disease. It is also sometimes used before surgery and following a bite wound to try to prevent infection. Ceftriaxone can be given by injection into a vein or into a muscle.
Document 2 (Title: Ceftriaxone in chemoprophylaxis and therapy of urinary tract infections.): We analysed eight prospective randomized trials describing the use of ceftriaxone (Rocephin) in short-term prophylaxis in patients undergoing urologic surgery. The results of these trials show that chemoprophylaxis with ceftriaxone is effective. In the therapy of postoperative infections in urologic surgery the single daily dose of ceftriaxone represents a considerable advantage both regarding patients' compliance and clinical convenience. From March 1987 to January 1988, 25 patients with postoperative infections after urologic surgery were treated with ceftriaxone 1 g i.m. once daily. Quick resolution of signs and symptoms of infection occurred in all cases.
Document 3 (Title: [Treatment of typhoid fever for three days with ceftriaxone].): Due to mass tourism and the exodus of refugees from Africa and Asia, typhoid fever, common in the tropics, has reappeared in the more temperate climates. The clinical signs of prolonged fever, headache, general malaise, anorexia and abdominal pain are not specific enough to allow diagnosis and only a blood culture will prove the presence of the disease. Unless there is resistance, which is in fact rare in Southeast Asia, chloramphenicol, an effective, well tolerated and cheap antibiotic, remains the treatment of choice for typhoid. In the search for an alternative treatment a cephalosporin, ceftriaxone (Rocephin) seems promising. It has a low MIC of 0.05 micrograms/ml for S. typhi and a high level of biliary excretion which destroys S. typhi in the bile and thus prevents relapse. In Southeast Asia three consecutive studies, of which two were randomised and comparative with chloramphenicol given for 14 days, showed that treatment for two or three days, 3 or 4 g per day of ceftriaxone was as effective as chloramphenicol and was not followed by relapse. In 46 adults there was one failure with ceftriaxone (in an immunocompromised patient) and none in the 30 patients treated with chloramphenicol, three of which, however, relapsed in the 15 days after completion of treatment. Defervescence was a little more rapid with chloramphenicol (six to seven days) than with ceftriaxone (seven to ten days) even though blood, urine and stool cultures were all negative from the third or fourth day of treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Document 4 (Title: [Use of ceftriaxone in urinary and respiratory tract infections].): Efficiency of ceftriaxone (Rocephin Hoffman Laroche) was assessed in 16 children aged between 3 and 14 years and in 4 adults aged between 17 and 70 years with severe infections of the urinary and respiratory tracts caused by E. coli. S. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, P. mirabilis or enterococci. Pyelonephritis as a sole pathology was diagnosed in 10 patients whereas in further 8 patients it complicated other diseases (nephrotic syndrome, hepatitis, cholangitis, leukemia). Pneumonia complicated nephritis leukemia or lymphoma in 8 children. Peritonitis was diagnosed in 1 adult patient. Ceftriaxone was given in a single daily dose of 50 mg/kg to all children and 2.0 g to adult patients for 7-10 days. No adverse reactions were noted. Clinical improvement was achieved in all treated patients. Cultures became negative in 17 cases after the treatment. Significant bacteremia caused by P. aeruginosa persisted in 2 patients and by E. coli in 1 patient. No toxic effects on liver, renal, pancreatic and bone marrow functioning were seen. Ceftriaxone may be safely and efficiently used for the treatment of the urinary and respiratory infections.
