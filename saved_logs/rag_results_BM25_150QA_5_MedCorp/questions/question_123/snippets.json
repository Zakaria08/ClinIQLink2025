        "title": "Iron poisoning",
        "content": "Toxic Dose Iron poisoning can occur when doses of 20 to 60 mg/kg or more of elemental iron is ingested with most cases reporting primarily gastrointestinal symptoms. Systemic signs and symptoms shown in serious toxicity occur at higher doses exceeding 60 mg/kg. Ingesting above 120 mg/kg may be fatal. The therapeutic dose for iron deficiency anemia is 3\u20136 mg/kg/day. Individuals who have ingested less than 20 mg/kg of elemental iron typically do not exhibit symptoms. It is unlikely to get iron poisoning from diet alone with iron supplements being the cause of overdose. The amount of elemental iron in an iron supplement can be calculate based on the percentage it constitutes for per tablet. For example, a 300 mg tablet of ferrous fumarate will contain 100 mg of elemental iron or 33%.",

        "content": "Today nicotine is less commonly used in agricultural insecticides, which was a main source of poisoning. More recent cases of poisoning typically appear to be in the form of Green Tobacco Sickness, accidental ingestion of tobacco or tobacco products, or ingestion of nicotine-containing plants. People who harvest or cultivate tobacco may experience Green Tobacco Sickness (GTS), a type of nicotine poisoning caused by dermal exposure to wet tobacco leaves. This occurs most commonly in young, inexperienced tobacco harvesters who do not consume tobacco. People can be exposed to nicotine in the workplace by breathing it in, skin absorption, swallowing it, or eye contact. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set the legal limit (permissible exposure limit) for nicotine exposure in the workplace as 0.5 mg/m3 skin exposure over an 8-hour workday. The US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended exposure limit (REL) of 0.5 mg/m3",

        "title": "[Thrombocytopenia in digitoxin poisoning].",
        "content": "Because she felt unwell, an 80-year-old woman who was receiving treatment with digitoxin (0.07 mg daily) raised the dose on her own initiative to twice or three times the previous level. She then experienced faintness, visual abnormalities and bradyarrhythmia (rate about 40/min). The ECG showed 2 degrees AV block. The digitoxin level was 70.8 ng/ml--far above the upper limit of the therapeutic range (7.5-25 ng/ml). One striking abnormality was thrombocytopenia (33,000/microliters), though the white and red cell counts were normal. Petechiae were not present and there was no evidence of internal bleeding. As the AV block had not produced any critical fall in ventricular rate, there was no need to start treatment with digitalis-binding antibody fragments (Fab fragments). Instead, the patient was given cholestyramine 4 g three times daily with the aim of interrupting the enterohepatic circulation of digitoxin. From then on the rise in platelet count paralleled the fall in digitoxin level. Seven days after discontinuing digitoxin the platelet count reentered the normal range (147,000/microliters). However, the digitoxin level (39.5 mg/ml) was still well above the therapeutic range.",

        "title": "T-2 mycotoxin",
        "content": "All of the mentioned effects happen when T-2 is ingested in high doses. Animals are able to metabolize the compound with enzymes from the CYP3A family, just like humans. Treatments At the moment, there is no specific therapy for T-2 mycotoxin poisonings. Exposure of the mycotoxin is typically followed by standardized treatment for toxic compounds in order to reduce the effect of the toxin. This includes using activated charcoal, which has a high binding capacity of 0.48 mg of T-2 mycotoxin to 1 mg of charcoal. For dermal contact, soap and water is used to reduce the dermal effects. As a kind of prophylaxis, antioxidants are believed to have properties that may provide benefits. Application There are currently no applications, aside from war, for T-2 mycotoxins; however, there are some plausible therapeutic uses. Due to their abilities, research shows possible uses for the mycotoxin as growth promoters, antibiotics, antivirals, as an antileukemic, and as an antimalarial.",
