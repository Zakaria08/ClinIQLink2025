Document 1 (Title: Predicate transformer semantics): Monotonic Predicate transformers of interest (wp, wlp, and sp) are monotonic. A predicate transformer T is monotonic if and only if: This property is related to the consequence rule of Hoare logic. Strict A predicate transformer T is strict iff: For instance, wp is strict, whereas wlp is generally not. In particular, if statement S may not terminate then is satisfiable. We have Indeed, true is a valid invariant of that loop. Terminating A predicate transformer T is terminating iff: Actually, this terminology makes sense only for strict predicate transformers: indeed, is the weakest-precondition ensuring termination of S. It seems that naming this property non-aborting would be more appropriate: in total correctness, non-termination is abortion, whereas in partial correctness, it is not. Conjunctive A predicate transformer T is conjunctive iff: This is the case for , even if statement S is non-deterministic as a selection statement or a specification statement.
Document 2 (Title: Selective concentration of IgD class-specific antibodies in human milk.): The participation of human IgD class antibody in local immune responses of breast tissue was studied by analysing the sera-to-milk ratios of total IgD, IgM, IgA, IgG isotypes and albumin found in matched samples, and by analysing the sera-to-milk (S/M) ratios of IgD, IgM, IgA, IgG antibodies against Haemophilus influenzae capsular polysaccharide (PRP), phosphorylcholine, tetanus and in some cases diphtheria antigens. The study group consisted of eight women immunized during pregnancy with PRP, and control, unimmunized women. Albumin, and total IgG showed high S/M ratios. IgA had a low S/M ratio as expected, consistent with reports that IgA is locally concentrated. Total IgD and IgM isotype ratio values were intermediate between IgG and IgA suggesting they were selectively concentrated in breast fluids due to local production or transport mechanisms, or both. Ratios for specific antibodies of IgA and IgM isotypes and for total IgA and IgM isotype showed parallel data. Among the IgD antibodies, those specific for PRP and phosphorylcholine suggested a higher degree of selective concentration as compared with tetanus antigen. In the group of unimmunized women, although selective concentration of total IgD was observed, specific antibody studies were inconclusive due to the low milk IgD antibody levels encountered. The results indicate that IgD (and also IgM) may participate in local immune responses of human breast tissues and fluids; possibly influenced by the nature of the antigen, the state of immunization and the hormonal environment (pregnancy).
Document 3 (Title: Quality storyboard): Analysis of Causes: Is there a clear statement of the major cause(s) of the issue? Have you explained how the possible causes were theorized? Are data included showing how the main causes were identified? Are data displayed in such a way that the connection between the issue and the cause(s) is clear? Have you explained how the data were collected and over what time-period they were collected? Plans: Is there a complete Purpose Statement and objectives designed to move toward the purpose: Direction, measure, reference, target, time frame, and owner? Is it clear how the target was derived from the analysis? Is it clear that the actions in the plan are aimed at correcting root cause(s)? Have you indicated what alternative solutions were considered, and how they were evaluated to select the best improvement theory? Have you included a copy of the planning documents? Have you indicated whether the plan was implemented on schedule? Study:
Document 4 (Title: Progress on the CSE diagnostic study. Application of McNemar's test revisited.): The authors describe an extension of McNemar's test that can be used to compare diagnostic performance when multiple statements are obtained from computer analysis or visual interpretation of the ECG. If two or more diagnostic statements are made, by definition only one can be correct for the cases in the CSE pilot database, which were selected for single, clinically well documented, abnormalities. If one statement stood out from others as being made with the highest degree of certainty, that was accepted as the single interpretation, right or wrong. However, when two or more statements were made with the same degree of certainty and only one statement was correct, then in the previous application of McNemar's test that interpretation was given credit for being correct. In the extension of the method presented in this article, such an interpretation is given partial credit for the one correct statement and partial discredit for any incorrect statement, thereby reporting the results more properly in the sensitivity and specificity statistics for the different diagnostic categories.
Document 5 (Title: Immunoglobulin D): Immunoglobulin D (IgD) is an antibody isotype that makes up about 1% of proteins in the plasma membranes of immature B-lymphocytes where it is usually co-expressed with another cell surface antibody called IgM. IgD is also produced in a secreted form that is found in very small amounts in blood serum, representing 0.25% of immunoglobulins in serum. The relative molecular mass and half-life of secreted IgD is 185 kDa and 2.8 days, respectively. Secreted IgD is produced as a monomeric antibody with two heavy chains of the delta (δ) class, and two Ig light chains. Function The function of IgD has been a puzzle in immunology since its discovery in 1964. IgD is present in species from cartilaginous fish to human (with the possible exception of birds). This nearly ubiquitous appearance in species with an adaptive immune system demonstrates that IgD may be as ancient as IgM and suggests that IgD has important immunological functions.

Answer the following list question.
Question: Select the correct statement(s): IgD:
Options:
1. Are responsible for anaphylactic phenomena
2. Have heavy chains consisting of 5 domains
3. Are monomeric
4. Are mainly membrane immunoglobulins
5. Have a molecular mass of approximately 160 to 190 kDa
