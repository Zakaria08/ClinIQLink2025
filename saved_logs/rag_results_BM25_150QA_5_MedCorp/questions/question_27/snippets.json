        "title": "[Suprasellar arachnoid cyst associated with precocious puberty: report of an operated case and review of the literature].",
        "content": "The pathogenesis remains unknown in the majority of patients with precocious puberty, and yet infrequently such causative cerebral lesions as hypothalamic hamartomas are associated with sexual precocity. We reported a rare case of suprasellar arachnoid cyst in an infant presenting with precocious puberty, which eventually disappeared after a cyst-peritoneal shunt. It was believed that the mass effect of the arachnoid cyst upon the hypothalamus was, at least in part, responsible for development of precocious puberty. The role of surgical decompression of the cyst was also discussed. A one-year-old girl was admitted to the hospital for evaluation of genital bleeding which had persisted on and off for two months. The height, 80cm, and the weight, 12.4kg, exceeded by far the two standard deviations from the mean level of the normal population. In addition she had the development of breast tissue as classified Tanner's Stage II, and both pubic and axillary hair. The bone age by skeletal survey of the hand was rated as 3 years. Endocrinological examination showed that serum levels of luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol had increased for her age, to levels equivalent to those for females at puberty. An LH-RH test revealed an excessive LH reaction. There were no definite neurological deficits. CT and MRI demonstrated the presence of a large arachnoid cyst involving the suprasellar region as well as the right middle and posterior fossa. After the patient underwent a cyst-peritoneal shunt, the cyst decreased in size and such symptoms as genital bleeding and breast growth disappeared. Serum levels of her LH and FSH also significantly decreased.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "content": "History of Present Illness: A 33-year-old\u00a0white female presents after admission to the general medical/surgical hospital ward with a chief complaint of shortness of breath on exertion. She reports that she was seen for similar symptoms previously at her primary care physician\u2019s office six months ago.\u00a0At that time, she was diagnosed with acute bronchitis and treated with bronchodilators, empiric antibiotics, and a short course oral steroid taper. This management did not improve her symptoms, and she has gradually worsened over six months. She reports a 20-pound (9 kg) intentional weight loss over the past year. She denies camping, spelunking, or hunting activities. She denies any sick contacts. A brief review of systems is negative for fever, night sweats, palpitations, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, neural sensation changes, muscular changes, and increased bruising or bleeding. She admits a cough, shortness of breath, and shortness of breath on exertion.",

        "title": "[A case of generalized komuragaeri disease (Satoyoshi disease) treated with glucocorticoid].",
        "content": "Generalized komuragaeri disease (Satoyoshi disease) is a rare disorder of unknown etiology, characterized by painful muscle spasms, alopecia, diarrhea and various endocrine disorders. We administered glucocorticoid to a girl with this disease, resulting in a marked improvement of all clinical features. The patient was a 15-year-old girl. Since the age of 13 years, she had had intermittent painful muscle spasms, which affected any skeletal muscles 5 to 15 times a day at exercise and at rest and lasted for a few minutes. At the age of 14 years, she had idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura which responded to the glucocorticoid treatment. Amenorrhea and orthostatic hypotension developed at the age of 14 years. Then the loss of body and head hair was noticed and progressed slowly. She had not experienced severe diarrhea. On admission, her physical and neurological examinations showed no abnormalities except for the thin hair and frequent muscle spasms. Laboratory examinations showed elevated levels of serum creatine kinase and aldolase, positive antinuclear antibody of speckled pattern and a mild disturbance in carbohydrate absorption. Endocrinological tests suggested the dysfunction of hypothalamus as a cause of amenorrhea. Electromyogram showed large action potentials on spasms. She was treated with glucocorticoid, 2 mg/kg on alternate days. The muscle spasms decreased gradually in frequency and duration in 1 month of treatment, and disappeared in 4 months. The growth of her hair was noticed and orthostatic hypotension disappeared in 4 months. Menstruation became regular in 7 months. The muscle spasms worsened when the dosage of glucocorticoid was reduced, and they improved on the increased dosage. She was free of symptoms at 6 months after the successful diminution of glucocorticoid. The etiology of this disease has not been revealed. The association of autoimmune disorders and the responsiveness of all clinical features to glucocorticoid suggest that an autoimmune process is involved in the pathogenesis of generalized komuragaeri disease.",
