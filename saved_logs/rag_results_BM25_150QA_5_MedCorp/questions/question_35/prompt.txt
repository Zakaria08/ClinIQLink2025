Document 1 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): Philip J. Rosenthal, MD A 5-year-old American girl presents with a 1-week history of intermittent chills, fever, and sweats. She had returned home 2 weeks earlier after leaving the USA for the first time to spend 3 weeks with her grandparents in Nigeria. She received all standard childhood immunizations, but no additional treat-ment before travel, since her parents have returned to their native Nigeria frequently without medical consequences. Three days ago, the child was seen in an outpatient clinic and diagnosed with a viral syndrome. Examination reveals a lethargic child, with a temperature of 39.8°C (103.6°F) and splenomegaly. She has no skin rash or lymphadenopathy. Ini-tial laboratory studies are remarkable for hematocrit 29.8%, platelets 45,000/mm3, creatinine 2.5 mg/dL (220 μmol/L), and mildly elevated bilirubin and transaminases. A blood smear shows ring forms of Plasmodium falciparum at 1.5% parasit-emia. What treatment should be started?
Document 2 (Title: A case of human ehrlichiosis acquired in Mali: clinical and laboratory findings.): We report on the clinical, epidemiologic, and laboratory characteristics of the first case of human ehrlichiosis acquired outside the United States caused by an Ehrlichia sp. other than E. sennetsu. The patient, a 24-year-old woman, presumably acquired the infection in Mali in northern Africa; the diagnosis was made when she returned to North America. The patient reported a fever and diarrhea a week before she left Mali; the diarrhea resolved, but the fever and chills continued. She also reported intermittent tingling in both hands and feet and muscle discomfort. Her temperature was 37.8 degrees C and her pulse rate was 100 per minute. She had two erythematous maculopapules (0.5 x 0.7 mm) on her thigh and ankle that resembled infected insect bites. Her hemoglobin level was 148 g/l with normal indices, and her white blood cell count was 10, 500/mm3 with many atypical lymphocytes and platelets. This report is intended to increase physicians' awareness of ehrlichiosis in foreign travelers and other patients, and suggests the need for further research to determine the prevalence and distribution of this disease.
Document 3 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): Her social history is significant for alcohol use (three to four glasses of wine/night). Her vital signs include the following: temperature 99.8°F, blood pressure 132/64 mm Hg, pulse 78 bpm, and respiratory rate 15/min. On physical examination, she had left upper abdominal tenderness with evidence of hepatomegaly and mild scleral icterus. Laboratory data revealed the following: alanine aminotransferase, 527 IU/L (normal 10–35 IU/L); aspartate aminotransferase, 425 IU/L (normal < 35 IU/L); and bilirubin, 2.9 mg/dL (normal 0.1–0.3 mg/dL). What medications do OTC cold and flu preparations typically contain? Which of the OTC medications might have contrib-uted to the patient’s current symptoms? KH, a 55-year-old woman, presents to the emergency department with nausea, vomiting, and complaints of new-onset flu symptoms over the past several days. Her past medical history is significant for allergic rhinitis and chronic lower back pain secondary to a work-related fall 2 years ago. Her

Document 5 (Title: [Successful treatment of levodopa-induced neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in a patient with Parkinson's disease].): A 77-year-old woman with a 9 years history of Parkinson's disease was admitted to our hospital because of high fever, disturbance of consciousness, increased muscular rigidity and abnormal involuntary movements. She was continuously treated with levodopa + carbidopa (Menesit) 300 mg and amantadine 150 mg every day until admission. On admission, the pulse rate was 102 per minute, blood pressure 90/40 mmHg, body temperature 40.9 degrees C, and bloody stool was noticed. On laboratory examination, erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 6 mm/h, thrombocytes 8.1 X 10(4)/microliters, fibrinogen 91 mg/dl, FDP 40 mg/ml, suggesting DIC. According to her biochemical examination, serum GOT (167 u), GPT (119 u), CPK (847 IU/l), BUN (53.9 mg/dl) and myoglobin (10,370 ng/ml) were increased. These laboratory data indicated that she was suffering from neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). On diagnosis of NMS associated with DIC, she was treated with dantrolene and FUT-175. Dantrolene was effective on the elevated COK level and FUT-175 was effective on the DIC, and symptoms of NMS and DIC were completely improved after a period of 14 days. Patients with Parkinson's disease have been suspected to have a low incidence of DIC, and this may be the first case report on successful treatment of levodopa-induced NMS with DIC in the patient with Parkinson's disease.

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
Question: A 19-year-old woman, accompanied by her parents, presents after a one-week history of abnormal behavior, delusions, and unusual aggression. She denies fever, seizures or illicit drug use. Family history is negative for psychiatric illnesses. She was started on risperidone and sent home with her parents. Three days later, she is brought to the emergency department with fever and confusion. She is not verbally responsive. At the hospital, her temperature is 39.8°C (103.6°F), the blood pressure is 100/60 mm Hg, the pulse rate is 102/min, and the respiratory rate is 16/min. She is extremely diaphoretic and appears stiff. She has spontaneous eye-opening but she is not verbally responsive and she is not following commands. Laboratory studies show: Sodium 142 mmol/L Potassium 5.0 mmol/L Creatinine 1.8 mg/dl Calcium 10.4 mg/dl Creatine kinase 9800 U/L White blood cells 14,500/mm3 Hemoglobin 12.9 g/dl Platelets 175,000/mm3 Urinalysis shows protein 1+, hemoglobin 3+ with occasional leukocytes and no red blood casts. What is the best first step in the management of this condition?
Options:
A. Intravenous hydration
B. Paracetamol
C. Stop risperidone
D. Switch risperidone to clozapine
