Document 1 (Title: Case Study: 33-Year-Old Female Presents with Chronic SOB and Cough (Archived) -- Case Presentation): History of Present Illness: A 33-year-old white female presents after admission to the general medical/surgical hospital ward with a chief complaint of shortness of breath on exertion. She reports that she was seen for similar symptoms previously at her primary care physician’s office six months ago. At that time, she was diagnosed with acute bronchitis and treated with bronchodilators, empiric antibiotics, and a short course oral steroid taper. This management did not improve her symptoms, and she has gradually worsened over six months. She reports a 20-pound (9 kg) intentional weight loss over the past year. She denies camping, spelunking, or hunting activities. She denies any sick contacts. A brief review of systems is negative for fever, night sweats, palpitations, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, neural sensation changes, muscular changes, and increased bruising or bleeding. She admits a cough, shortness of breath, and shortness of breath on exertion.
Document 2 (Title: Lower respiratory tract infection): Bronchitis describes the swelling or inflammation of the bronchial tubes. Additionally, bronchitis is described as either acute or chronic depending on its presentation and is also further described by the causative agent. Acute bronchitis can be defined as acute bacterial or viral infection of the larger airways in healthy patients with no history of recurrent disease. It affects over 40 adults per 1000 each year and consists of transient inflammation of the major bronchi and trachea. Most often it is caused by viral infection and hence antibiotic therapy is not indicated in immunocompetent individuals. Viral bronchitis can sometimes be treated using antiviral medications depending on the virus causing the infection, and medications such as anti-inflammatory drugs and expectorants can help mitigate the symptoms. Treatment of acute bronchitis with antibiotics is common but controversial as their use has only moderate benefit weighted against potential side effects (nausea and
Document 3 (Title: Palatine tonsil): Clinical significance The pathogenesis of infectious/inflammatory disease in the tonsils most likely has its basis in their anatomic location and their inherent function as organ of immunity, processing infectious material, and other antigens and then becoming, paradoxically, a focus of infection/inflammation. No single theory of pathogenesis has yet been accepted, however. Viral infection with secondary bacterial invasion may be one mechanism of the initiation of chronic disease, but the effects of the environment, host factors, the widespread use of antibiotics, ecological considerations, and diet all may play a role. A recent cross-sectional study revealed a high rate of prevalent virus infections in non-acutely ill patients undergoing routine tonsillectomy. However, none of the 27 detected viruses showed positive association to the tonsillar disease.
Document 4 (Title: [Late diagnosis of unilateral pulmonary hypoplasia. Report of a case].): A 12 year old female with three to four annual episodes of respiratory tract infections since age 2 months, was admitted to the hospital with the chief complaint of acute bronchitis. During her hospital stay, the diagnosis of left pulmonary hypoplasia was considered, which was lately confirmed by means of respiratory function tests, chest X-ray films, simple and perfusion gammagraphy as well as bronchography. During the 3 years follow-up, her body growth although below the third percentile for Mexican standards, has had normal annual increments (4.5-5.0 cm/year) and in the last eight months she has grown at a rate of 10.5 cm/year, simultaneously with the initial development of her secondary sexual characteristics. During the follow-up she has had only four minor episodes of respiratory tract infections which have been treated exclusively with symptomatic drugs. She is now under a program of pulmonary physiotherapy. It is concluded that throughout the years the right lung has satisfactorily compensated the initial deficit in pulmonary function and thus, is not only the degree of malformation, but also the complications secondary to it, with has a prognostic value for these patients, along with the supportive general medical management implanted.
Document 5 (Title: Hypogammaglobulinemia): The presenting feature of hypogammaglobulinemia is usually a clinical history of recurrent, chronic, or atypical infections. These infections include but are not limited to: bronchitis, ear infections, meningitis, pneumonia, sinus infections, and skin infections. Such infections can potentially damage organs, leading to severe complications. Other symptoms of hypogammaglobulinemia include chronic diarrhea and complications from receiving live vaccines. Certain symptoms of chronic damage may be related to recurrent infection. For example, shortness of breath, chronic cough, and sputum production may indicate the presence of bronchiectasis. Sinus pain, nasal discharge, and postnasal drip may indicate the presence of chronic sinusitis. Diarrhea and steatorrhea may indicate malabsorption. Another sign or symptom that may occur in patients is blotchiness of the skin color, especially noticed above the waist, on the arms, neck, and upper chest areas, however, it may occur anywhere
