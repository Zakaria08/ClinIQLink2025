Document 1 (Title: Melioidosis): Following the treatment of the acute disease, eradication (or maintenance) treatment with co-trimoxazole is the drug of choice and should be used for at least 3 months. For those with neurological melioidosis and osteomyelitis, drugs should be given for more than 6 months. Co-amoxiclav and doxycycline are drugs of second choice. Co-trimoxazole should not be used in those with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, as it can cause haemolytic anemia. Other side effects, such as rash, hyperkalemia, renal dysfunction, and gastrointestinal symptoms, should prompt the reduction of co-trimoxazole doses. Chloramphenicol is no longer routinely recommended for this purpose. Co-amoxiclav is an alternative for patients unable to take co-trimoxazole and doxycycline (e.g. pregnant women and children under the age of 12), but is not as effective and has higher relapse rate. Single-agent treatment with fluoroquinolone (e.g., ciprofloxacin) or doxycycline for the oral maintenance phase is
Document 2 (Title: Co-trimoxazole compared to chloramphenicol in the treatment of enteric fever.): Co-trimoxazole (trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole combination) was effective in the control of the acute infection in 60 patients with proven enteric fever. The mean interval between initiating treatment and defervescence was similar to that observed with a comparable group of 38 patients treated with chloramphenicol. Both co-trimoxazole and chloramphenicol were well tolerated and no serious adverse reactions, attributed to either drug, were noted. Two patients treated with chloramphenicol relapsed. No relapses were noted in the co-trimoxazole treated group. Although the evidence available at present in inadequate for drawing final conclusions regarding the relative efficacy of these two therapeutic agents in enteric fever, co-trimoxazole should be considered as an alternative drug, particularly when encountering salmonella strains resistant to chloramphenicol and ampicillin.
Document 3 (Title: Ofloxacin versus co-trimoxazole for prevention of infection in neutropenic patients following cytotoxic chemotherapy.): The efficacy of ofloxacin in preventing infection in neutropenic patients following cytotoxic chemotherapy was evaluated and was compared with that of co-trimoxazole. A total of 102 patients with hematological malignancies were randomly selected to receive either co-trimoxazole or ofloxacin. All patients were monitored for compliance, occurrence of infection, and drug-related side effects. A surveillance culture of a rectal swab was performed regularly. A total of 25 of the 52 patients (48%) who received co-trimoxazole and 11 of the 50 patients (22%) who received ofloxacin developed fever during the study period (P less than 0.025). Gram-negative bacteremia occurred in nine patients in the co-trimoxazole group (17%) but in only one patient (2%) in the ofloxacin group (P less than 0.05). No patient in either group had documented gram-positive bacterial or Pneumocystis carinii infection. Poor performance status was the only identifiable factor associated with an increased incidence of bacteremia. The surveillance study showed that significantly fewer bacterial strains were resistant to ofloxacin than to co-trimoxazole and that acquisition of resistance to co-trimoxazole was more commonly observed than was acquisition of resistance to ofloxacin. Significantly more patients had skin rashes following co-trimoxazole than ofloxacin treatment (P less than 0.05). Ofloxacin was superior to co-trimoxazole in preventing infection in this population of neutropenic patients.
Document 4 (Title: Kinetics and comparative efficacy of ofloxacin versus co-trimoxazole in the asymptomatic bacteriuria of elderly subjects.): In a prospective randomized study ofloxacin (400 mg orally once daily) versus co-trimoxazole (320/1,600 mg orally once daily) were given for 3 weeks in 30 and 22 elderly semimobile patients respectively, suffering from asymptomatic bacteriuria. From the obtained results it was evident that: (a) ofloxacin was superior to co-trimoxazole regarding eradication of bacteriuria (p less than 0.05) particularly in patients with a positive antibody-coated bacteria test; (b) a high rate of superinfections and reinfections with strains resistant to co-trimoxazole was observed in both groups indicative of hidden underlying conditions predisposing to urinary tract infections and (c) ofloxacin did not accumulate in serum during prolonged therapy but the half-life ranged between 8.3 and 10.2 h.
Document 5 (Title: Prophylactic co-trimoxazole versus norfloxacin in neutropenic children--perspective randomized study.): Co-trimoxazole or norfloxacin were randomly administered to 44 granulocytopenic children with malignancies in order to prevent bacterial infections. Although more patients in the co-trimoxazole group had febrile episodes (p less than 0.01), the mean of febrile days and the mean of days with systemic antibiotics did not differ significantly in the two groups. Five patients in the co-trimoxazole group had a microbiologically documented infection (four with septicemia) due to Escherichia coli (n = 2), Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus sp. There were four septicemic episodes in the norfloxacin group due to P. aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus mitis and Streptococcus faecalis. Compliance was good during administration of both drugs. No signs or symptoms of arthropathy were seen in the norfloxacin group. The number of gram-negative bacilli resistant to co-trimoxazole isolated from stools significantly increased during prophylaxis with co-trimoxazole (p less than 0.001). Norfloxacin did not select resistant strains and was very active in eradicating gram-negative bacilli from stools (27.5% of positive cultures).
