Document 1 (Title: [An emergency cesarean section using general anesthesia for a patient with schizophrenia].): A 27 year-old female in 39th week gestation with schizophrenia underwent an emergency Cesarean section using general anesthesia. A diagnosis of schizophrenia was made two years previously, since then oral anti-psychotic drugs such as chlorpromazine had been given to her. In June 1989 she suddenly became excited and generalized muscle rigidity was observed without any triggering episodes. Her excitement was so marked that we had to administer intramuscular levomepromazine 75 mg and diazepam 10 mg to her, but they failed to sedate her adequately. Emergency Cesarean section was scheduled to overcome this situation. Spinal or epidural anesthesia was not indicated because of her vigorous excitement, and anesthesia was induced with thiopental 350 mg and succinylcholine 40 mg. Induction-delivery time was 12 minutes. Pentazocine 30 mg in combination with nitrous oxide was given for the maintenance of anesthesia. Plasma levomepromazine levels were 46.9 ng.ml-1 in the mother and 11.3 ng.ml-1 in the umbilical vein, respectively. The baby's Apgar score was 9 and 1 min and 9 at 5 min after the delivery. The baby developed slight generalized tremor until next day, probably due to effect of levomepromazine given before the Cesarean section. The patient was discharged without any cardiorespiratory trouble and her baby has been doing well so far.
Document 2 (Title: Risk Management Event Evaluation and Responsibilities -- Issues of Concern -- Patient Handoff): For example, handoff of a patient following the "I-PASS" system would be structured as follows: "This patient is a watcher. Ms. X is a 65-year-old female, anticoagulated on apixaban, who presented to the ED after a mechanical fall. She was neurologically intact, but her head CT showed a subdural hematoma without midline shift, so she was admitted to the ICU. She needs neurological checks every 1 hour and a repeat head CT in 4 hours. Should she have an acute mental status change, please plan to reverse her anticoagulation, consider intubating her and giving hypertonic saline, obtain a STAT head CT, and contact neurosurgery immediately. "After this, the receiving provider would summarize the patient and repeat the action points back to ensure proper understanding.
Document 3 (Title: Heart rate in fetuses and neonates in normal conditions and with mild depression.): The continuous recording of fetal and neonatal heart rate gives reliable information on the condition of the fetus and neonate. In the present study the results obtained in vigorous and mildly depressed newborns, by the continuous recording of fetal heart rate during labor and of neonatal heart rate during 90 minutes after birth, are presented. Twenty three pregnant women were studied during labor, as well as their newborns. They fulfilled the following conditions: --Mothers without known complications and good prenatal care. --Term pregnancies with single fetuses in vertex presentation with birthweight normal for age. --All labors started, progressed and delivered spontanously withoug signs of fetal distress. No drugs were given to the mother during labor or to the neonate. The umbilical cord was clamped immediately after birth. Seventeen neonates were vigorous at 1 and 5 minutes (Apgar score 7 or higher). Six neonates were slightly depressed at the first minute but all of them recovered at 5 minutes. Both groups are studied separately. Figure 1 shows the average values of BFHR and NHR corresponding to 17 vigorous newborns (Apgar scores 7-10 at the first and fifth minutes of life). No major variations were found in the average values of BFHR in the time period studied. No statistically significant differences were found in the BFHR of the same fetus at 60, 30 and 8 minutes before delivery (Fig. 2). A decrease in BFHR occurred during the 6 minutes preceding birth (fig. 1). After birth the average values of NHR were higher than the fetal ones (Fig. 1). This post-natal increase in heart rate (32 beats/min) is statistically significant when BFHR values 30 minutes before delivery are compared with NHR values recorded 10 minutes after birth (Fig. 3). After this initial increase, NHR starts a gradual fall, lasting about 50 minutes and then becomes stable at a level similar to that of fetal heart rate (Fig. 1). Figure 1 shows that puncture of the heel causes an increase in NHR. The difference between NHR before and after the puncture is significant (Fig. 6). The heart rate of 6 newborns which were slightly depressed at the first minute of life (Apgar score 4-6) but vigorous at the fifth minute, are not significantly different from those of the vigorous group of 17 neonates (Fig.7). The cases chosen for this study have been carefully selected with the aim of establishing the "normal" pattern of fetal and neonatal heart rate. We concluded that in normal term labors BFHR remains stable from 90 until 10 minutes before delivery; there is a tendency to fall during the last 6 minutes preceeding birth. Immediately after birth, neonatal heart rate rises significantly, then falls gradually and becomes stabilized 50 minutes after delivery, at levels similar to those of BFHR.
Document 4 (Title: Nutria): Life history Nutria can live up to six years in captivity, but individuals uncommonly live past three years old; according to one study, 80% of nutrias die within the first year, and less than 15% of a wild population is over three years old. Male nutrias reach sexual maturity as early as four months, and females as early as three months; however, both can have a prolonged adolescence, up to the age of 9 months. Once a female is pregnant, gestation lasts 130 days, and she may give birth to as few as one or as many as 13 offspring. They generally line nursery nests with grasses and soft reeds. Baby nutrias are precocial, born fully furred and with open eyes; they can eat vegetation with their parents within hours of birth. A female nutria can become pregnant again the day after she gives birth to her young. If timed properly, a female can become pregnant three times within a year. Newborn nutrias nurse for seven to eight weeks, after which they leave their mothers.
Document 5 (Title: Persistent pulmonary arterial hypertension of the newborn.): Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) characterised by right to left shunting with intense cyanosis is difficult to manage, and in the best of centres carries a 40-60 percent mortality. We report our one year's experience of managing six neonates with PPHN. There were 5 males and 1 female with mean birth weight of 2.59 +/- 0.487 kg and gestation period 39 +/- 2.0 wks and 1 minute Apgar score 2.8 +/- 2.1. Four to six babies were born by cesarean section and 3-6 babies had aspiration pneumonia. All babies presented within 12 hours of age (mean 5.08 +/- 5 hrs) with intense cyanosis and respiratory distress. Diagnosis were confirmed in all by (a) hyperoxia test, (b) simultaneous determination of preductal and postductal paO2 (c) contrast echocardiography and (d) hyperoxia-hyperventilation test. Babies were managed with hyperventilation using mean ventilatory rates of 100 +/- 45 per minute, an inspired oxygen concentration of 100%, peak inspiratory pressures 27 +/- 9 cm of H2O, and expiratory pressures 5 +/- 1.6 cms of H2O, and mean air way pressures of 10.4 +/- 2.7 cms H2O. Alkali therapy was used in 3 of the six babies whereas low dose dopamine was infused in all six babies. Inspite of aggressive ventilatory therapy, only 3 out of 6 babies could be salvaged.

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
