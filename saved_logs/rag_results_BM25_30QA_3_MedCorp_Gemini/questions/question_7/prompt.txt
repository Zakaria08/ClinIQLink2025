With your own knowledge and the help of the following document:

Document 1 (Title: Metronidazole -- Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes): There should be judicious prescribing of metronidazole by providers only for known indications and high clinical suspicion for needing treatment of anaerobic bacterial infections, protozoal infections, and microaerophilic bacterial infections. Overprescribing may contribute to increasing future antibiotic resistance to the drug, so a pharmacy consult is necessary for the prescriber to ensure directed therapy. The documentation already exists regarding increased resistance to metronidazole in the treatment of C. difficile infections. Also, prescribers, nurses, and pharmacists should routinely educate patients to abstain from alcoholic beverages while taking metronidazole, which will help lead to fewer disulfiram reaction symptoms; nursing will play a role in this monitoring and for other potential adverse effects. The patient should also be informed by the health care provider of the possible change in urine color while on this medicine. The team of health professionals, including physicians, physician assistants, nurses, and pharmacists, must work together to provide the best care for these patients when using metronidazole in any formulation. [Level 5]
Document 2 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): Adverse effects include nausea, diarrhea, stomatitis, and peripheral neuropathy with prolonged use. Metronidazole has a disulfiram-like effect, and patients should be instructed to avoid alcohol. Although teratogenic in some animals, metronidazole has not been associated with this effect in humans. Other properties of metronidazole are discussed in Chapter 52. A structurally similar agent, tinidazole, is a once-daily drug approved for treatment of trichomonas infection, giardiasis, amebiasis, and bacterial vaginosis. It also is active against anaerobic bacteria, but is not approved in the USA for treatment of anaerobic infections.
Document 3 (Title: Gynecology_Novak): Treatment Ideally, treatment of BV should inhibit anaerobes but not vaginal lactobacilli. The following treatments are effective: 1. Metronidazole, an antibiotic with excellent activity against anaerobes but poor activity against lactobacilli, is the drug of choice for the treatment of BV. A dose of 500 mg administered orally twice a day for 7 days should be used. Patients should be advised to avoid using alcohol during treatment with oral metronidazole and for 24 hours thereafter. 2. Metronidazole gel, 0.75%, one applicator (5 g) intravaginally once daily for 5 days, may also be prescribed. The overall cure rates range from 75% to 84% with the aforementioned regimens (16). Clindamycin in the following regimens is effective in treating BV: 1. Clindamycin ovules, 100 mg, intravaginally once at bedtime for 3 days 2. Clindamycin bioadhesive cream, 2%, 100 mg intravaginally in a single dose 3. Clindamycin cream, 2%, one applicator full (5 g) intravaginally at bedtime for 7 days 4.
