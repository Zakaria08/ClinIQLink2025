With your own knowledge and the help of the following document:

Document 1 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Missense and nonsense mutations in the apoA-I gene are present in some patients with low plasma levels of HDL-C (usually 15–30 mg/ dL), but are a rare cause of low plasma HDL-C levels. Most individuals with low plasma HDL-C levels due to missense mutations in apoA-I do not appear to have premature CHD. Patients who are heterozygous for an Arg173Cys substitution in apoA-I (so-called apoA-IMilano) have very low plasma levels of HDL-C due to impaired LCAT activation and accelerated clearance of the HDL particles containing the abnormal apoA-I. Despite having very low plasma levels of HDL-C, these individuals do not have an increased risk of premature CHD. A few selected missense mutations in apoA-I and apoA-II promote the formation of amyloid fibrils, which can cause systemic amyloidosis.
Document 2 (Title: Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia -- Complications): Patients with CAH are at an increased risk of cardiometabolic diseases, including hypertension, obesity, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, impaired glucose homeostasis, increased carotid intima-media thickness, and cardiovascular events. However, most data available are based on surrogate markers rather than definitive outcomes. [51] [52] Practitioners should remain cautious, promote a healthy lifestyle, and continue analyzing longer-term data to assess hard outcomes.
Document 3 (Title: Familial Combined Hyperlipidemia -- Evaluation): Several studies have reported an association between FCH and increased carotid intima-media thickness (IMT), a marker of subclinical atherosclerosis. Therefore, a carotid ultrasound may be performed to assess the presence of subclinical atherosclerosis in patients with FCH. [24] [25]
