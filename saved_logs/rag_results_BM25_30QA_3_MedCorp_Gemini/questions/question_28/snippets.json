Mosaic Terminal capillaries surrounding roughly circular or polygonal-shaped blocks of acetowhite epithelium crowded together are called mosaic because their appearance is similar to mosaic tile (Fig. 19.11). These vessels form a \u201cbasket\u201d around the blocks of abnormal epithelium. They may arise from a coalescence of many terminal punctate vessels or from the vessels that surround the cervical gland openings (5). Mosaicism tends to be associated with higher-grade lesions and CIN 2 (Fig. 19.12) and CIN 3 (Fig. 19.13). Atypical Vascular Pattern Atypical vascular patterns are characteristic of invasive cervical cancer and include looped vessels, branching vessels, and reticular vessels.",
