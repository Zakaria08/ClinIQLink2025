Document 1 (Title: Physiology, Pituitary Hormones -- Mechanism -- Growth Hormone): Growth Hormone has a direct and indirect mechanism of action. The direct effect of growth hormone involves growth hormone directly binding to its receptors on target cells to stimulate a response. The indirect effect is mediated by the action of insulin-like growth factor-1(IGF-1), which is secreted by the liver hepatocytes in response to growth hormone. Insulin-like growth factor-1 binds to its receptor, IGF-1R, on the cellular surface. It activates a tyrosine kinase-mediated intracellular signaling pathway that phosphorylates various proteins intracellularly, leading to increased anabolism, cellular replication and division, and metabolism.

Document 2 (Title: Pediatrics_Nelson): The hypothalamus controls many endocrine systems either directly or through the pituitary gland. Higher central nervoussystem (CNS) centers control the hypothalamus. Hypothalamicreleasing or inhibiting factors travel through capillaries of the pituitary portal system to control the anterior pituitary gland,regulating the hormones specific for the factor (Fig. 170-2).The pituitary hormones enter the peripheral circulation andexert their effects on target glands, which produce other hormones that feed back to suppress their controlling hypothalamicand pituitary hormones. Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1),growth hormone (GH), cortisol, sex steroids, and thyroxine (T4)all feed back on the hypothalamic-pituitary system. Prolactin isthe only pituitary hormone that is suppressed by a hypothalamicfactor, dopamine. The hypothalamus is also the location of vasopressin-secreting axons that either terminate in the posteriorpituitary gland and exert their effect via vasopressin secretion
Document 3 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): may be a novel therapeutic strategy for preventing early PMN activation and subsequent organ failure in severely injured patients.Growth Hormone, Insulin-Like Growth Factor, and Ghrelin. Growth hormone (GH) is a neurohormone expressed primarily by the pituitary gland that has both metabolic and immunomodulatory effects. GH promotes both protein synthe-sis and insulin resistance while enhancing the mobilization of fat stores. GH secretion is upregulated by hypothalamic GH–releasing hormone and downregulated by somatostatin. GH pri-marily exerts its downstream effects through direct interaction with GH receptors and through the enhanced hepatic synthesis of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), an anabolic growth fac-tor that is known to improve the metabolic rate, gut mucosal function, and protein loss after traumatic injury. Less than 5% of IGF-1 circulates free in the plasma, with the remainder bound principally to one of six IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs), the majority to IGFBP-3.
