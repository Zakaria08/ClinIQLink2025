With your own knowledge and the help of the following document:

Document 1 (Title: Anatomy_Gray): In the orbit the ophthalmic artery gives off numerous branches as follows: the lacrimal artery, which arises from the ophthalmic artery on the lateral side of the optic nerve, and passes anteriorly on the lateral side of the orbit, supplying the lacrimal gland, muscles, the anterior ciliary branch to the eyeball, and the lateral sides of the eyelid; the central retinal artery, which enters the optic nerve, proceeds down the center of the nerve to the retina, and is clearly seen when viewing the retina with an ophthalmoscope—occlusion of this vessel or of the parent artery leads to blindness; the long and short posterior ciliary arteries, which are branches that enter the eyeball posteriorly, piercing the sclera, and supplying structures inside the eyeball; the muscular arteries, which are branches supplying the intrinsic muscles of the eyeball; the supra-orbital artery, which usually arises from the ophthalmic artery immediately after it has crossed the optic nerve, proceeds
Document 2 (Title: Anatomy, Head and Neck, Eye -- Nerves): The optic nerve is the sensory nerve that transmits impulses from the retina to the brain. The oculomotor , trochlear, and abducens nerve innervate the extraocular muscles. The oculomotor nerve has The ophthalmic nerve branches into the lacrimal, frontal, and nasociliary nerves. The lacrimal nerve runs to the lacrimal glands and branches off to other areas. The frontal nerve supplies sensation to the superior eyelid and forehead. The nasociliary nerve is the sensory nerve to the eyeball. [7] [8]
Document 3 (Title: Retrobulbar Block -- Anatomy and Physiology): Motor and sensory innervation: The oculomotor nerve provides motor innervation of the inferior oblique and rectus muscles, except the lateral rectus. The trochlear nerve innervates the superior oblique muscle. This nerve exits the annulus and runs along the muscular surface, typically unaffected by inferotemporal blocks. The orbicularis muscle is innervated by the facial nerve, which frequently must be blocked to prevent blinking during surgery. For this reason, a van Lint block is used at the same time as the retrobulbar block. Sensory innervation of the eye is majorly provided by the first branch of the trigeminal nerve (V1) and its branches (frontal, lacrimal, and nasociliary). The lacrimal and frontal branches of V1 innervate the peripheral conjunctiva. However, these branches run in the extraconal space; thus, the intraconal blockade will not provide any anesthetic effect in these branches. The second branch of the trigeminal nerve (V2) provides only a minor contribution to sensorial innervation through the infraorbital nerve. [4]

Answer the following multiple-choice question.

Options:
A. Central aery of the retina
B. Infraorbital aery
C. Lacrimal aery
D. Nasociliary aretry
