Document 1 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): in the pulled-through segment leading to ganglion cell loss. Long-term results with the three procedures are comparable and generally excellent in experienced hands. These three procedures also can be adapted for total colonic aganglionosis in which the ileum is used for the pull-through segment.Anorectal MalformationsAnatomic Description. Anorectal malformations describe a spectrum of congenital anomalies that include imperforate anus and persistent cloaca. Anorectal malformations occur in approximately 1 in 5000 live births and affect males and females almost equally. The embryologic basis includes failure of descent of the urorectal septum. The level to which this septum descends determines the type of anomaly that is present, which subsequently influences the surgical approach.In patients with imperforate anus, the rectum fails to descend through the external sphincter complex. Instead, the rectal pouch ends “blindly” in the pelvis, above or below the levator ani muscle. In most
Document 2 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): In all cases, it is critical that the level at which ganglion-ated bowel exists be determined. Most surgeons believe that the anastomosis should be performed at least 5 cm from the point at which ganglion cells are found. This avoids performing a pull-through in the transition zone, which is associated with a high incidence of complications due to inadequate emptying of the pull-through segment. Up to one-third of patients who undergo a transition zone pull through will require a reoperation.The main complications of all procedures include post-operative enterocolitis, constipation, and anastomotic stricture. There is also a reported incidence of recurrent Hirschsprung’s disease, which may reflect either residual aganglionic bowel left behind after the pull-through, or the presence of ischemia in the pulled-through segment leading to ganglion cell loss. Long-term results with the three procedures are comparable and generally excellent in experienced hands. These three procedures also
Document 3 (Title: Percutaneous Gastrostomy and Jejunostomy -- Technique or Treatment): The "pull" technique is most commonly used and was initially introduced by Gauderer et al. A string is attached to a needle and inserted via the abdominal wall into the stomach. It is grasped with endoscopic biopsy forceps or a snare, and then the endoscope is retracted, taking out the string through the esophagus and mouth. Then the string is attached to the external end of the PEG tube, and the string is pulled back through the abdominal wall. This results in pulling the tube from the mouth to the esophagus, the stomach, and then outside the body through the abdominal wall. [9]
Document 4 (Title: Glossectomy -- Technique or Treatment -- Transcervical Pull-Through Glossectomy Approach): Glossectomy via transcervical pull-through is an alternative resection technique to transoral glossectomy and lip-split mandibulotomy. This approach is a combined transoral/transcervical technique whereby the tongue, floor of the mouth, and the sublingual compartment are released through the submental and submandibular compartments into the neck. Compared to transoral glossectomy alone, this technique provides better exposure for a posterior resection. Transoral glossectomy can be converted to a pull-through without adding a significant time to the procedure. The exposure is not as wide as the lip-split mandibulotomy. However, transcervical pull-through does not require a mandibular osteotomy, thus avoiding the added procedure time for mandibular reconstruction and its associated complications. Flap inset requires thoughtful and disciplined closure to reduce the risk of a postoperative fistula.
Document 5 (Title: Swimmer's Shoulder -- Pathophysiology): Swimming strokes can be broken down into pull-through and recovery phases. The latissimus dorsi and the pectoralis major are the primary contributors to the propulsive forces of the swim stroke through adduction and internal rotation. The subscapularis and serratus anterior muscles also play an integral role in the freestyle stroke. [2] [21] [22] [19] The freestyle stroke can be divided into six distinct parts/phases: Hand entry Forward reach Pull through Middle pull through Hand exit Middle recovery
Document 6 (Title: Glossectomy -- Indications -- Technique-Specific Indications): Severe trismus is an obstacle to transoral glossectomy. Even with the administration of paralytics, if the jaw cannot be opened, lip-split mandibulotomy or transcervical pull-through may be indicated. Transcervical pull-through requires transoral mucosal cuts that might not be possible in severe trismus cases. In patients with prior head and neck radiation, lip-split mandibulotomy carries the risk of osteoradionecrosis. If feasible, cervical pull-through may be favored over mandibulotomy due to the theoretical risk of osteoradionecrosis.
Document 7 (Title: Gastrostomy Tube Replacement -- Introduction): A gastrostomy tube (G-tube) is indicated for long-term enteral nutritional support in patients with dysphagia secondary to various disorders. Endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement is now the preferred modality over surgical gastrostomy owing to a less invasive nature and faster time to start feeding. [1] During endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement, a small incision is made over the anterior abdominal wall through which the tube is placed via a push method (the tube inserted percutaneously through the incision) or a pull technique (the tube is pulled out from the stomach through the incision). Once the tube is placed, a fistulous gastrocutaneous tract is formed in about 2-4 weeks. However, in certain conditions such as severe malnutrition, immunocompromised patients, and large ascites, tract maturity is further delayed. If a percutaneous gastrostomy endoscopic (PEG) tube is dislodged within a month after placement, then endoscopic replacement is recommended. However, if the tube is dislodged after 4 to 6 weeks when tract maturity is expected, bedside replacement is usually sufficient. If the tube is dislodged within 4 weeks of initial placement, patients are at significant risk of peritonitis and perforation due to peritoneal spillage of gastric contents through the immature track, and replacement should not be attempted without surgical consultation. A blind attempt to re-insert the tube or even foley placement in an immature tract can lead to inadvertent placement of the tube into the peritoneal cavity. In this review article, we discuss the replacement of the Gastrostomy tube in adult patients with complete maturation of the gastrocutaneous tract.
Document 8 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): the newborn period as this provides excellent visualization of the pelvis. In children with significant colonic distention, it is important to allow for a period of decompression using a rectal tube if a single-staged pull-through is to be performed. In older children with very distended, hypertrophied colon, it may be prudent to perform a colostomy to allow the bowel to decom-press prior to performing a pull-through procedure. However, it should be emphasized that there is no upper age limit for per-forming a primary pull-through.Of the three pull-through procedures performed for Hirschsprung’s disease, the first is the original Swenson pro-cedure. In this operation, the aganglionic rectum is dissected in the pelvis and removed down to the anus. The ganglionic colon is then anastomosed to the anus via a perineal approach. In the Duhamel procedure, dissection outside the rectum is confined to the retrorectal space, and the ganglionic colon is anastomosed posteriorly just above the
Document 9 (Title: Facial Nerve Repair -- Technique or Treatment -- Direct End-to-End Coaptation): A cutting or spatula-tipped needle is preferable to a tapered needle. Tapered needles, such as those used for microvascular anastomosis, quickly dull with repeated passes through the relatively tough epineurium; cutting and spatula-tipped needles will not. The authors prefer to sew toward themselves whenever possible, placing the first bite of the first stitch through only the epineurium of the distal nerve stump and directing the stitch from outside the nerve to inside the nerve. The second bite is taken after pulling the needle completely through the distal stump epineurium; this bite goes from within the nerve to outside, again taking only epineurium in the bite. To approximate the nerve ends before tying, pull the suture through the nerve back towards the distal stump until the tail is short enough to manage easily. Four flat throws on the knot with the tails cut short will suffice, with a surgeon's knot often placed as the first throw.
Document 10 (Title: Hirschsprung Disease -- Treatment / Management): The recommended timing for a definite pull-through procedure varies from four to six months following colostomy placement. A variety of pull-through surgeries have been identified. The traditional Swenson's technique involves proctectomy, pulling the healthy ganglionated colon through, and anastomosing it to the anus. Novel surgical procedures (e.g., Duhamel's and Soave's procedures) have the advantage of preserving the intricate innervation of the rectum and bladder. [34] The early postoperative period following Soave's procedure is critical. Frequent regular sessions of mechanical anastomotic dilations, which might be done at home, are highly recommended. All of these procedures have high success rates, and morbidity is minimal. [35]
Document 11 (Title: Gynecology_Novak): To apply the Falope ring, the midisthmic portion of the tube is grasped, with tongs advanced through a cylindrical probe that has the ring stretched around it (Fig. 10.12A). A loop of tube is pulled back into the probe, and the outer cylinder is advanced (Fig. 10.12B), releasing the Silastic ring around the base of the loop of tube, producing ischemic necrosis (Fig. 10.12C). If the tube cannot be pulled easily into the applicator, the operator should stop and change to electrical coagulation rather than persist and risk lacerating the tube with the Falope ring applicator. The banded tube must be inspected at close range through the laparoscope to demonstrate that the full thickness of the tube was pulled through the Falope ring.

Document 12 (Title: Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy Tube -- Technique or Treatment -- Ponsky Technique): Ponsky technique (preoral pull) is the most commonly used and is similar to the Sacks-Vine technique; however, it requires pulling the feeding tube rather than pushing it. A braided suture is passed through the needle and entrapped by a snare passed through the endoscope. The needle is removed, and the endoscope with the snare and suture is withdrawn from the mouth. The feeding tube is attached to the rope is withdrawn from the stomach as the tube is carefully guided from the patient's mouth into the stomach and pulled through the anterior abdominal wall. The endoscope is re-inserted into the mouth to visualize the proper positioning of the feeding tube on the stomach wall. The skin disc is placed to hold the tube in position, and the length and tightness of the tube are noted. [5]
Document 13 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): down to below the peritoneal reflection. The operation then proceeds at the perineum, and the location of the muscle complex is determined using the nerve stimulator. A Veress needle is then advanced through the skin at the indicated site, with the laparoscope providing guidance to the exact intrapelvic orientation. Dilators are then placed over the Veress needle, the rectum is then pulled through this perito-neal opening, and an anoplasty is performed.JAUNDICEThe Approach to the Jaundiced InfantJaundice is present during the first week of life in 60% of term infants and 80% of preterm infants. There is usually accumula-tion of unconjugated bilirubin, but there may also be deposition of direct bilirubin. During fetal life, the placenta is the principal route of elimination of unconjugated bilirubin. In the newborn infant, bilirubin is conjugated through the activity of glucoronyl transferase. In the conjugated form, bilirubin is water soluble, which results in its excretion into the
Document 14 (Title: Gynecology_Novak): Surgical Treatment In general, surgical treatment should be employed after conservative measures have failed. Although there may be exceptions to this principle, most surgeons follow this recommendation because of the poor long-term outcomes and high complication rates with surgery for fecal incontinence. Overlapping sphincteroplasty is the procedure of choice for fecal incontinence caused by a disrupted anal sphincter. Most authorities believe that an overlapping technique is superior to an end-to-end repair, although there are few direct comparisons in the literature. The rationale for the overlapping technique is that a more secure repair can be accomplished by placing sutures through the scarred connective tissue rather than the sphincter muscle. Sutures should be less likely to tear through or pull out of connective tissue than muscle. Therefore, the key component of the overlapping technique is preservation of the scarred ends of the ruptured EAS for suture placement.
Document 15 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): artery. Gastric tubes are fashioned from the greater curvature of the stomach based on the pedi-cle of the left gastroepiploic artery. When the entire stomach is used, as in gastric pull-up, the blood supply is provided by the right gastric artery. The neoesophagus may traverse (a) sub-sternally; (b) through a transthoracic route; or (c) through the posterior mediastinum to reach the neck. A feeding jejunostomy is placed at the time of surgery and tube feedings are instituted once the postoperative ileus has resolved. Long-term follow-up has shown that all methods of esophageal substitution can sup-port normal growth and development, and the children enjoy reasonably normal eating habits. Because of the potential for late complications such as ulceration and stricture, follow-up into adulthood is mandatory, but complications appear to dimin-ish with time.Gastroesophageal RefluxGastroesophageal reflux (GER) occurs to some degree in all children and refers to the passage of gastric
