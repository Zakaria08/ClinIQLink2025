Document 2 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): 1154 Rickettsial diseases David H. Walker, J. Stephen Dumler, Thomas Marrie The rickettsiae are a heterogeneous group of small, obligately intra-cellular, gram-negative coccobacilli and short bacilli, most of which are transmitted by a tick, mite, flea, or louse vector. Except in the case of louse-borne typhus, humans are incidental hosts. Among 211 Epidemiologic clues to the transmission of a particular pathogen include (1) environmental exposure to ticks, fleas, or mites during the season of activity of the vector species for the disease in the appropriate geographic region (spotted fever and typhus rickettsioses, scrub typhus, ehrlichioses, anaplasmosis); (2) travel to or residence in an endemic geographic region during the incubation period (Table 211-1); (3) expo-sure to parturient ruminants, cats, and dogs (Q fever); (4) exposure to flying squirrels (R. prowazekii infection); and (5) history of previous louse-borne typhus (recrudescent typhus). Clinical laboratory findings, such
Document 3 (Title: Weil Felix Test -- Etiology and Epidemiology): The etiologic agents of rickettsial diseases have diverse transmission mechanisms, wide geographic distributions, and a range of disease manifestations. Rickettsiae are most commonly transmitted through fleas, ticks, mites, or mouse vectors, with humans acting as incidental hosts. [4] The Rickettsiaceae that cause life-threatening infections are R. rickettsii (rocky mountain spotted fever), R. prowazekii (louse-borne typhus), Orientia tsutsugamushi (scrub typhus), R. conorii (Mediterranean spotted fever), R. typhi (murine typhus); and, in rare cases, other organisms of the spotted fever group. Most rickettsial species are limited to a particular region due to climatic conditions and natural host constraints; however, some rickettsia species can be encountered globally, such as R. felis and R. typhi . [5] Epidemiologic clues can be used to narrow the possible bacterial etiologies of a suspected rickettsial infection. [6] These clues include:
Document 4 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Rickettsial infections dominated by fever may resolve without further clinical evolution. However, after nonspecific early manifestations, the illnesses can also evolve along one or more of several principal clinical lines: (1) development of a macular or maculopapular rash; (2) development of an eschar at the site of tick or mite feeding; (3) development of a vesicular rash (often in rickettsialpox and African tick-bite fever); (4) development of pneumonitis with chest radiographic opacities and/or rales (Q fever and severe cases of Rocky Mountain spotted fever [RMSF], Mediterranean spotted fever [MSF], louse-borne typhus, human monocytotropic ehrlichiosis [HME], human granulocytotropic anaplasmosis [HGA], scrub typhus, and murine typhus); (5) development of meningoencephalitis (louse-borne typhus and severe cases of RMSF, scrub typhus, HME, murine typhus, MSF, and [rarely] Q fever); and (6) progressive hypotension and multiorgan failure as seen with sepsis or toxic shock syndromes

Application of these clinical, epidemiologic, and laboratory principles requires consideration of a rickettsial diagnosis and knowledge of the individual diseases.

Document 7 (Title: Neurology_Adams): The following are the major rickettsial diseases: 1. Epidemic typhus, small pockets of which are present in many developing parts of the world. It is transmitted from lice to humans and from person to person. 2. Murine (endemic) typhus, which is present in the same areas as Rocky Mountain spotted fever (see in the following text). It is transmitted by fleas from rats to humans. 3. Scrub typhus or tsutsugamushi fever, which is confined to eastern and southeastern Asia. It is transmitted by mites from infected rodents or humans. 4. Rocky Mountain spotted fever, first described in Montana, is most common in Long Island, Tennessee, Virginia, North Carolina, and Maryland and in the Southwest. It is transmitted by special varieties of ticks.
Document 8 (Title: Rickettsial Infection -- Epidemiology): Rickettsia is typically vector-borne, transmitted by ticks, body lice, mites, and fleas. [6] In most cases, humans are thought to be accidental hosts. The transmitting ticks vary depending on the region and organism, with Dermacentor variabilis (American dog tick), Dermacentor andersoni (Rocky Mountain wood tick), and Amblyomma americanum (Lone Star tick) associated with most cases of Rocky Mountain spotted fever in the United States. Alternatively, Amblyomma cajennense has been associated with spotted fever in South America and Amblyomma hebraeum or Amblyomma variegatum in South Africa. [7] Because of the association with ticks and other vectors, infections with rickettsiae are more common during warmer months and in people exposed to outdoor activities. Epidemic typhus, R. prowazekii , is transmitted by body lice and is associated with crowded conditions and poor hygiene. Murine typhus ( R. typhi ) is most commonly reported in tropical and subtropical areas and is associated with flea bites. [8]

Document 10 (Title: Scrub Typhus -- Etiology): Scrub typhus is a significant cause of underdiagnosed acute febrile illness and is prevalent in endemic regions. This disease can affect multiple organ systems primarily through vasculitis and perivascular inflammation. Mite larvae or chiggers, which carry the pathogenic gram-negative bacteria, are the vectors to humans, and they transmit the organism through their bite. The infection persists in nature through transovarial transmission in the vector and occasionally in small mammals as a reservoir. [4]
Document 11 (Title: Pathology_Robbins): Table 9.3 ). Chlamydia and Rickettsia are obligate intracellular bacteria that replicate inside membrane-bound vacuoles in epithelial and endothelial cells, respectively. These bacteria get most or all of their energy source, ATP, from the host cell. Chlamydia trachomatis is a frequent infectious cause of female sterility (by scarring and narrowing of the fallopian tubes) and blindness (by chronic inflammation of the conjunctiva that eventually causes scarring and opacification of the cornea). Rickettsiae injure the endothelial cells in which they grow, causing a hemorrhagic vasculitis, often visible as a rash, but they also may injure the central nervous system (CNS), with potentially fatal outcome, as in Rocky Mountain spotted fever and epidemic typhus. Rickettsiae are transmitted by arthropod vectors, including lice (in epidemic typhus), ticks (in Rocky Mountain spotted fever and ehrlichiosis), and mites (in scrub typhus).
Document 12 (Title: Pediculosis Corporis -- Pathophysiology): The most significant medical impact of body lice is their ability to transmit bacterial diseases, most notably trench fever caused by Bartonella quintana , relapsing fever caused by Borrelia recurrentis , and epidemic (louse-borne) typhus caused by Rickettsia prowazekii . [7] Trench fever and epidemic typhus are transmitted not by louse bites but through infected feces. When feeding, the body louse often excretes feces onto the skin, which can be inadvertently rubbed into the bite site, eyes, or mucous membranes. Rickettsia prowazekii can also be transmitted through inhalation of aerosolized fecal dust, which has been documented as a potential source of infection for clinicians. Unlike trench fever and epidemic typhus, the transmission of relapsing fever, caused by Borrelia recurrentis , does not occur through contaminated feces. Infection occurs when a person crushes an infected louse, and the bacteria invade the bite site or the skin of the fingers or hand that crushed the louse. [7] In addition, a person can acquire the infection if they rub their eye or put their fingers in their mouth after crushing the louse.
Document 13 (Title: Chigger Bites and Trombiculiasis -- History and Physical -- Scrub Typhus): Chiggers are known vectors of scrub typhus, which is a bacterial infection caused by a gram-negative coccobacillus, O tsutsugamushi . [11] Although Hantavirus, [12] Borrelia burgdorferi , [13] and Ehrlichia phagocytophila [14] have been detected in trombiculid mites, the transmission of these diseases from trombiculid mites to humans has not been reported.
Document 14 (Title: Insect Bites -- Etiology -- Insecta): Chiggers are tiny red mite larvae, measuring 0.3 to 1.0 mm in length, belonging to the Thrombiculidae family. Encounters with chiggers tend to be in tall grasses, weeds, and in woodlands. Infestations occur when mite larvae feed on human skin, predominantly in areas where they reach a constricting area of clothing such as at the ankles, thigh or waist. Bites are usually not felt initially, but an allergic reaction to the mite saliva causes the development of extremely pruritic red papules 3 to 14 hours later. Mites are visible on the skin as tiny red dots that will often crawl until reaching an area of clothing-skin interfaces such as the top of a sock or the belt-line of pants. If present, chiggers can easily be removed in the shower by scrubbing the skin with soap and water. The primary treatment is to control the intense itching with topical calamine lotion or corticosteroids and systemic antihistamines. Chiggers do not transmit any diseases in the U.S. but are vectors for Scrub Typhus in parts of Asia, Russia, and islands of the Indian and the Pacific Oceans.
