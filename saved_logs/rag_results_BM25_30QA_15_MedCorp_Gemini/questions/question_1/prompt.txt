Document 1 (Title: Snellen Chart -- Definition/Introduction): Tumbling E: Dr. Snellen also developed this chart, which he designed for children and those unable to read or unfamiliar with the Roman alphabet. This chart displays a capital letter E facing in various directions. While observing each character, the patient points in the direction that the E is facing. Landolt C: Comparable to the Tumbling E, this chart displays a C - which some say appears more similar to a broken ring - facing in various directions. The chart was developed by the Swiss ophthalmologist Landolt and is regarded as a laboratory standard by the International Council of Ophthalmology. LEA Symbols Chart : This chart was designed for visual acuity screening in children to eliminate the problems of language barriers. The chart utilizes symbols and creates a play environment to entertain the pediatric patient during the exam. Vivekanand et al. determined that the LEA symbols chart performs better than the Snellen chart for visual acuity assessments in preschool children. [4]
Document 2 (Title: Neurology_Adams): Impairment of visual function, expressed as defects in acuity and alterations of visual fields, obviously stands as the most important symptom of eye disease. A number of terms are commonly used to describe visual loss. Amaurosis is a general term that refers to partial or complete loss of sight. Amblyopia refers to any monocular deficit in vision that occurs in the presence of normal ocular structures. A major cause of amblyopia is the suppression by the brain of vision from one eye during early childhood caused by either strabismus, anisometropia (a significant difference in refractive error), or by media opacities. Nyctalopia is a term for poor twilight or night vision and is associated with extreme myopia, cataracts, vitamin A deficiency, retinitis pigmentosa, and, often, color blindness. There are also a number of positive visual symptoms that are named based on their characteristics, phosphenes, migrainous scintillations, visual illusions, and hallucinations. Irritation,
Document 3 (Title: Pediatrics_Nelson): The most common cause of severe visual impairment in children is retinopathy of prematurity (see Chapter 61). Congenital cataracts may lead to significant amblyopia. Cataracts also are associated with other ocular abnormalities and developmental disabilities. Amblyopia is a pathologic alteration of the visual system characterized by a reduction in visual acuity in one or both eyes with no clinically apparent organic abnormality that completely accounts for the visual loss. Amblyopia is due to a distortion of the normal clearly formed retinal image (from congenital cataracts or severe refractive errors); abnormal binocular interaction between the eyes as one eye competitively inhibits the other (strabismus); or a combination of both mechanisms. Albinism, hydrocephalus, congenital cytomegalovirus infection, and birth asphyxia are other significant contributors to blindness in children.

Document 5 (Title: Pediatric Cataract -- History and Physical): Recognition acuity testing assesses the ability to recognize specific stimuli, encompassing direction identification using Landolt C or Snellen E tests, letter identification with Snellen charts or high-contrast optotype visual acuity (HOTV) tests, and picture identification with tools like Allen picture cards or Domino charts. Behavioral pattern assessment, through techniques like the Cardiff acuity test and optokinetic drum test, evaluates visual function indirectly by observing the child's response to visual stimuli. [43]
Document 6 (Title: Visual Acuity -- Introduction): In the 1800s, there was a move to standardize visual testing, which led to the formation of several visual acuity charts with different optotypes. The first and still most widely used today is the Snellen chart. Other testing charts developed around that time include the Tumbling E chart, Landolt C chart, and Allen chart. More recently, the LogMAR chart (also known as ETDRS chart) has gained favor. The LogMAR chart provides more accurate results when compared to other visual acuity charts, and the results are more easily used in vision analysis, making it the preferred chart in clinical studies. [2]
Document 7 (Title: Visual Acuity -- Equipment): Depending on the patient's vision and ability, one or more of the following may be required: Optotype chart (e.g., Snellen, tumbling E, Landolt C, Allen, or LogMAR chart) Occluder card or patch Pinhole occluder Penlight/flashlight [6]
Document 8 (Title: Evaluation of Visual Acuity -- Equipment -- Tests to Assess Visual Acuity): Tests to assess visual acuity fall into one of the three following groups, with some requiring special equipment. Detection acuity tests assess the ability to detect the smallest stimulus. Examples of detection acuity tests include: Boeck candy bead test Catford drum test Dot visual acuity test Schwarting metronome test STYCAR graded balls test Recognition acuity tests assess the ability to recognize the stimulus. Examples of recognition acuity tests include: Bailey-Hall cereal test Bailey-Lovie chart Beale Collin picture charts Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) chart Landolt C test Lea symbols chart [13] Lighthouse test Lippman's HOTV test Sheridan letter test Sjogren hand test Snellen charts Snellen E test Resolution acuity tests include: Optokinetic drum Preferential looking test
Document 9 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): CHAPTER 39 Disorders of the Eye PART 2 Cardinal Manifestations and Presentation of Diseases FIguRE 39-1 The Rosenbaum card is a miniature, scale version of the Snellen chart for testing visual acuity at near. When the visual acuity is recorded, the Snellen distance equivalent should bear a nota-tion indicating that vision was tested at near, not at 6 m (20 ft), or else the Jaeger number system should be used to report the acuity.
Document 10 (Title: Snellen Chart -- Definition/Introduction): Freiburg Visual Acuity Test (FrACT) : The FrACT is an automated, computerized test that displays large Landolt C optotypes on a monitor screen. The monitor randomly presents Landolt C characters in various sizes and orientations. Schulze-Bonsel et al. determined that the FrACT can be utilized to quantify the visual acuities previously characterized as "hand motion" and "counting fingers." [5]
Document 11 (Title: Neurology_Adams): In the investigation of a disturbance of vision, one inquires as to what the patient means when he claims that he cannot see properly, for the disturbance in question may vary from nearor farsightedness to diplopia, partial syncope, dizziness, or a hemianopia. Fortunately, the patient’s statement can be checked by the measurement of visual acuity, which is an essential part of the ocular examination. Inspection of the refractive media and the optic fundi, the testing of pupillary reflexes, color vision, and the plotting of visual fields complete this part of the examination. Examination of the eye movements is also essential, particularly if amblyopia predicated on an early life strabismus is suspected, as discussed in Chap. 13.
Document 12 (Title: Anisometropia -- Evaluation): Amblyopia can be detected by measuring the natural and corrected visual acuity with normal or specific optotype charts, such as Landolt C or tumbling "E" charts, picture charts, or Tellers tables, according to the patient's age, compliance, and intellectual capability (See various optotype chart images). The refraction must be measured in cycloplegic conditions.
Document 13 (Title: Tests for Potential Vision -- Procedures -- Visual Acuity): Although this is not a test for potential vision, it is a test that needs to be performed at the very beginning of the ocular examination. [4] Visual acuity is defined as the reciprocal of the minimum resolvable angle. It is a subjective method of assessing macular function. Different components of visual acuity include distance vision, near vision, color vision, and contrast sensitivity, which can be measured using different methods. [5] Distant vision – Snellen's chart, Landolt C chart, Sheridan Gardiner HOTV test. [6] Near vision – Jaeger chart, Roman chart, and Snellen near vision chart. [7] Color vision – Ishiharas pseudoisochromatic plates, Farnsworth Munsell 100 Hue test, Green lantern test and Anomaloscopes. [8] Contrast sensitivity – Pelli-Robson, Regan, Arden-Grating charts. [9] [10]
Document 14 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): The Snellen chart is used to test acuity at a distance of 6 m (20 ft). For convenience, a scale version of the Snellen chart called the Rosenbaum card is held at 36 cm (14 in.) from the patient (Fig. 39-1). All subjects should be able to read the 6/6 m (20/20 ft) line with each eye using their refractive correction, if any. Patients who need reading glasses because of presbyopia must wear them for accurate testing with the Rosenbaum card. If 6/6 (20/20) acuity is not present in each eye, the deficiency in vision must be explained. If it is worse than 6/240 (20/800), acuity should be recorded in terms of counting fingers, hand motions, light perception, or no light perception. Legal blindness is defined by the Internal Revenue Service as a best corrected acuity of 6/60 (20/200) or less in the better eye or a binocular visual field subtending 20° or less. For driving the laws vary by state, but most states require a corrected acuity of 6/12 (20/40) in at least one eye for unrestricted
Document 15 (Title: Neurology_Adams): Once binocular fusion is established, usually by 6 months of age, any type of ocular muscle imbalance will cause diplopia, as images then fall on disparate or noncorresponding parts of the two functionally active retinas. After a time, however, the child eliminates the diplopia by suppressing the image from one eye. After another variable period, the suppression becomes permanent, and the individual retains diminished visual acuity in that eye, the result of prolonged disuse (amblyopia ex anopsia), as described in the last portion of Chap. 12. Nonparalytic strabismus may create misleading ocular findings in the neurologic examination. Sometimes a slight phoric misalignment of the eyes is first noticed after a head injury or a febrile infection, or it may be exposed by any other neurologic disorder or drug intoxication that impairs fusional mechanisms (vergence).
