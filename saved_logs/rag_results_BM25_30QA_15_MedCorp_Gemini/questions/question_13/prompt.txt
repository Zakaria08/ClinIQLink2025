Document 1 (Title: Health Maintenance Organization -- Nursing, Allied Health, and Interprofessional Team Interventions): HMOs are a type of managed care designed to maintain the health of their patients cost-effectively. A primary method HMOs use to achieve these goals is to coordinate health services and care provided to patients. [15] Such care coordination requires collaboration among various members of the care team. Multiple strategies have sought to attempt to improve care coordination in managed care organizations such as HMOs. For example, explicitly defining the responsibility of each member of the care team is thought to improve coordination among members. [16] Financial risk-sharing strategies, such as bundled payments and capitated payments, shared among different care team members, can also incentivize increased collaboration for cost-efficient care. [17] Additionally, pharmacies have attempted to control costs without compromising care by using techniques such as drug formularies and prescribing protocols. [17] Ultimately, strategies that can incentivize communication among the various members of the care team and further align their goals can improve care coordination within an HMO.
Document 2 (Title: Gynecology_Novak): Correlation of Findings Biopsy must be performed on patients with a dominant or suspicious mass despite absence of mammographic findings (48). Mammography should be performed before biopsy so other suspicious areas can be noted and the contralateral breast can be checked (Fig. 21.2). Mammography is never a substitute for biopsy because it may not reveal clinical cancer, especially when it occurs in the dense breast tissue of young women with fibrocystic changes. The sensitivity of mammography is 75%, with a specificity of 92.3% depending on the patient’s age; breast density; use of hormone therapy; and the size, location, and mammographic appearance of the tumor (49). Mammography is less sensitive in young women with dense breast tissue than in older women, who tend to have fatty breasts, in which mammography can detect at least 90% of malignancies (50). Small tumors, particularly those without calcifications, are more difficult to detect, especially in women with dense breasts.
Document 3 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Genetic screening for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations and other markers of breast cancer risk has identified a group of women at high risk for breast cancer. Unfortunately, when to begin and the optimal frequency of screening have not been defined. Mammography is less sensitive at detecting breast cancers in women carrying BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, possibly because such cancers occur in younger women, in whom mammography is known to be less sensitive. MRI screening may be more sensitive than mammography in women at high risk due to genetic predisposition or in women with very dense breast tissue, but specificity may be lower. An increase in overdiagnosis may accompany the higher sensitivity. The impact of MRI on breast cancer mortality with or without concomitant use of mammography has not been evaluated in a randomized controlled trial.
Document 4 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): in BRCA mutation carriers, provided it is performed and interpreted by an experienced radiologist with a high level of suspicion. Pres-ent screening recommendations for BRCA mutation carriers who do not undergo risk-reducing mastectomy include clinical breast examination every 6 months and mammography every 12 months beginning at age 25 years because the risk of breast cancer in BRCA mutation carriers increases after age 30 years. Recent attention has been focused on the use of MRI for breast cancer screening in high-risk individuals and known BRCA mutation carriers. MRI appears to be more sensitive at detect-ing breast cancer in younger women with dense breasts.113 How-ever, as noted previously, MRI does lead to the detection of benign breast lesions that cannot easily be distinguished from malignancy, and these false-positive events can result in more interventions, including biopsy specimens. The current recom-mendations from the American Cancer Society are for annual MRI in women
Document 5 (Title: Cancer Screening -- Function -- Breast Cancer): As mammography rates remained constant during this period, the recent rise in breast cancer incidence cannot be attributed to increased detection through mammography. However, due to breast cancer screening, most cases are diagnosed at stage I, which has a 5-year survival rate of 100%. [6] From 1989 to 2015, breast cancer mortality dropped by 39%. The mortality rate among women aged 50 and older has continued to decline since 2007, while it has remained steady for women aged 50 or younger. [7] Widely accepted breast cancer screening modalities include mammography, breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT), breast ultrasound, and breast self-examinations.
Document 6 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): used continue to be mod-ified and improved to enhance image quality.137-140 Conventional mammography delivers a radiation dose of 0.1 cGy per study. By comparison, chest radiography delivers 25% of this dose. However, there is no increased breast cancer risk associated with the radiation dose delivered with screening mammography. Screening mammography is used to detect unexpected breast cancer in asymptomatic women. In this regard, it supplements history taking and physical examination. With screening mam-mography, two views of the breast are obtained: the craniocau-dal (CC) view (Fig. 17-20A,B) and the mediolateral oblique (MLO) view (Fig. 17-20C,D). The MLO view images the great-est volume of breast tissue, including the upper outer quadrant and the axillary tail of Spence. Compared with the MLO view, the CC view provides better visualization of the medial aspect of the breast and permits greater breast compression. Diagnos-tic mammography is used to evaluate women with abnormal
Document 7 (Title: Health Maintenance Organization -- Issues of Concern): HMOs increased in popularity following the passage of the HMO Act in 1973, which sought to increase the usage of HMOs to improve patient care, decrease health care costs, and put a greater emphasis on preventative health care. [3] [4] In the years following the HMO Act, HMOs became a prominent method of health insurance in the United States. For example, by 1987, over 29 million Americans (12%) received care through HMOs. [1] As such, it is useful for health care providers to understand HMOs and their features.
Document 8 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Some observational data suggest that the length of the interval between menopause onset and HT initiation may influence the association between such therapy and breast cancer risk, with a “gap time” of <3–5 years conferring a higher HT-associated breast cancer risk. (This pattern of findings contrasts with that for CHD, as discussed later in this Chapter.) However, this association remains inconclusive and may be a spurious finding attributable to higher rates of screening mammography and thus earlier cancer detection in HT users than in nonusers, especially in early menopause. Indeed, in the WHI trial, hazard ratios for HT and breast cancer risk did not differ among women bEnEfiTS AnD RiSkS of PoSTmEnoPAuSAl HoRmonE THERAPy in THE ovERAll STuDy PoPulATion of womEn 50–79 yEARS of AgE in THE inTERvEnTion PHASE of THE womEn’S HEAlTH iniTiATivE (wHi) ESTRogEn-PRogESTin AnD ESTRogEn-AlonE TRiAlSa diseased women and women many years past (n.s.)

Document 9 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): A number of trials have suggested that annual or biennial screening with mammography or mammography plus clinical breast examination in normal-risk women older than age 50 years decreases breast cancer mortality. Each trial has been criticized for design flaws. In most trials, breast cancer mortality rate is decreased by 15–30%. Experts disagree on whether average-risk women age 40–49 years should receive regular screening (Table 100-3). The U.K. Age Trial, the only randomized trial of breast cancer screening to specifically evaluate the impact of mammography in women age 40–49 years, found no statistically significant difference in breast cancer mortality for screened women versus controls after about 11 years of follow-up (relative risk 0.83; 95% confidence interval 0.66–1.04); however, <70% of women received screening in the intervention arm, potentially diluting the observed effect. A meta-analysis of eight large randomized trials showed a 15% relative reduction in mortality
Document 10 (Title: Health Maintenance Organization -- Clinical Significance): The HMO Act offered funds to support HMO development with the hope of improving overall U.S. health care and simultaneously decreasing costs. HMOs are designed to accomplish these goals by integrating health insurance and health care delivery within the same organization and thus aligning the incentives of the health care payer and provider. [5] This structure intends to yield lower health care costs by, for example, motivating the transition of inpatient care to outpatient care when appropriate and the utilization of less expensive and fewer unnecessary medical interventions. [5] [6] Following the passage of the HMO Act, HMO enrollment increased from approximately 6 million in 1976 to over 29 million in 1987. [1]
Document 11 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): used to estimate a younger woman’s risk of developing breast cancer and that help assess the risks and benefits of regular screening.Screen film mammography has replaced xeromam-mography because it requires a lower dose of radiation and provides similar image quality. Digital mammography was developed to allow the observer to manipulate the degree of contrast in the image. This is especially useful in women with dense breasts and women <50 years of age. Recently, investigators directly compared digital vs. screen film mam-mography in a prospective (DMIST) trial that enrolled over 42,000 women.143 The investigators found that digital and screen film mammography had similar accuracy; however, digital mammography was more accurate in women <50 years of age, women with mammographically dense breasts, and premenopausal or perimenopausal women. The use of digital breast tomosynthesis with 3D images has been introduced as an alternative to standard 2D mammography imaging that is limited by
Document 12 (Title: Mammary Paget Disease -- Evaluation): After a careful history and physical exam, the workup may be started either with mammography or a biopsy of the lesion. Scrape cytology is a quick, easy, non-invasive method of screening eczema of the nipple in the out-patient clinic. Bilateral mammography should be done to look for underlying mass. Approximately 50% of cases of PDB have associated abnormal mammographic findings. In 20 percent of cases, a mammographic abnormality is present without a palpable mass . The mammographic findings may include simply a mass or suspicious microcalcifications, architectural distortion, and asymmetric thickening of the nipple-areolar complex. A negative mammogram does not rule out underlying malignancy. In one case series, mammography failed to find underlying Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) in 17 women, five of them had the extensive multicentric disease. Whole breast ultrasound can be done for further evaluation, but the addition of ultrasound to mammography has not been found to increase the overall sensitivity to detect underlying lesion as compared to mammography alone. However, ultrasound can be used to further categorize or to guide core biopsy from any palpable mass or mass-like abnormality found in mammography.
Document 13 (Title: Breast Cancer Screening in the Average-Risk Patient -- Continuing Education Activity): Breast cancer is the most common non-skin cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in women. Early detection through screening can significantly reduce both morbidity and mortality. Screening recommendations distinguish between women at average and high risk for developing breast cancer, as this risk stratification guides the selection of screening methods and timing. Most major guidelines recommend starting routine mammography at age 40 for women at average risk. Although the frequency of screening—either annually or biennially—varies among guidelines, the overall trend is toward increased surveillance due to its potential to save lives.
Document 14 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): In addition to addressing the negative impact of smoking on fertility and pregnancy outcome, counseling about nutrition and weight is a fundamental component of infertility and pregnancy management. Both low and increased body mass index (BMI) are associated with infertility in women and with increased morbidity during pregnancy. Obesity has also been associated with infertility in men. The treatment of infertility should be tailored to the problems unique to each couple. In many situations, including unexplained infertility, mild-to-moderate endometriosis, and/or borderline semen parameters, a stepwise approach to infertility is optimal, beginning with low-risk interventions and moving to more invasive, higher risk interventions only if necessary. After determination of all infertility factors and their correction, if possible, this approach might include, in increasing order of complexity: (1) expectant management, (2) clomiphene citrate or an aromatase inhibitor (see below) with or
