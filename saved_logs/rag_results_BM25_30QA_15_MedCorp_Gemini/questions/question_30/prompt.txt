Document 1 (Title: Pediatrics_Nelson): The simplest way to assess intellectual abilities is through language skills. Language function is receptive (understanding speech or gestures) and expressive (speech and use of gestures). Abnormalities of language resulting from cerebral hemisphere disorders are referred to as aphasias. Anterior, expressive, or Broca aphasia is characterized by sparse, non-fluent language. Posterior, receptive, or Wernicke aphasia is characterized by an inability to understand language, with speech that is fluent but nonsensical. Global aphasia refers to impaired expressive and receptive language. The cranial nerve evaluation assesses brainstem integrity but depends on the stage of brain maturation and the ability to cooperate. A colorful toy may capture a young child’s attention and permit observation of coordination, movement, and cranial nerve function.
Document 2 (Title: Fahr Syndrome -- History and Physical -- Clinical Features): (A) Movement disorder like features: [4] Signs and symptoms resembling parkinsonism, such as bradykinesia, rigidity, tremor, hypophonia, hypomimia, mask-like facies, shuffling gait Clumsiness Fatigability Gait dysfunction Choreoathetosis Dystonia Slurred speech Muscle cramping Pyramidal or cerebellar symptoms (rarely) (B) Neuropsychiatric features [5] Depression Apoplexia Dementia, mostly fronto-executive type resembling subcortical dementia in Wilson disease and Huntington disease Concentration deficits Behavioral changes (C) Other CNS features [6] [3] Loss of consciousness Tetany Seizures Spasticity Speech impairment Myoclonus Coma Papilledema Chronic headache Vertigo Urinary urgency or incontinence Impotence Severe hypertension
Document 3 (Title: Body Dysmorphic Disorder -- Pathophysiology): Subjects with BDD have a decreased ability to recognize the emotions of others through facial expressions, an emotional processing deficit. One study found that patients with BDD are likelier to misinterpret neutral facial expressions in photographs as angry. [23] Executive function may also be impaired. Specific areas of difficulty are response inhibition, planning, and decision-making. [24] [25] Deficits in executive function combined with neuroimaging findings suggest that subjects with BDD have frontal lobe dysfunction compared to healthy controls. [26]
Document 4 (Title: Neurology_Adams): Broca aphasia conforms to a primary deficit in language output and speech production with relative preservation of comprehension. There is a wide range of variation in the severity of the motor speech deficit, from the mildest poverty of speech and minimal dysarthria with entirely intact comprehension and ability to write (so-called Broca area aphasia; “mini-Broca”), to a complete loss of all means of lingual, phonetic, written, and gestural communication. Because the muscles that can no longer be used in speaking may still function in other acts, they are not paralyzed. The term apraxia has been imprecisely applied to this deficit in oro-buccal-lingual use (it does not represent the loss of a previously learned ability) but there are accompanying apractic deficits of the orofacial apparatus as noted in the following text.
Document 5 (Title: Broca Aphasia -- History and Physical): Broca aphasia is non-fluent aphasia. The output of spontaneous speech is markedly diminished. There is a loss of normal grammatical structure (agrammatic speech). Specifically, small linking words, conjunctions (and, or, but), and the use of prepositions are lost. For example, a sentence like "I took the dog for a walk." may become "I walk the dog." Patients can exhibit interjectional speech with a long latency, and the words expressed are produced as if under pressure. The ability to repeat phrases is also impaired. Despite these impairments, the produced words are often intelligible and contextually correct. In pure Broca aphasia, comprehension is intact. Patients with Broca aphasia are often very upset about their difficulty communicating. This may be due to the deficit or damage to adjacent frontal lobe structures, which control the inhibition of negative emotions. Broca aphasia can accompany other neurological deficits such as right facial weakness, hemiparesis or hemiplegia, and apraxia.
Document 6 (Title: Neuroanatomy, Broca Area -- Clinical Significance): Insults and injury to the brain and the Broca area may lead to Broca's aphasia. Also known as expressive aphasia, it is non-fluent aphasia characterized by partially losing the ability to produce spoken and written language. Their speech will still contain important content, but they may omit articles, prepositions, and other words that only have grammatical significance. Thus, they are said to have "telegraphic speech." The aphasia can vary in severity, and in some cases, patients may only be able to speak in single-word sentences. In other words, these individuals know what they are trying to say, but they cannot say it. Patients will also lose the ability of repetition, as an intact Broca area, Wernicke's area, and arcuate fasciculus are required to repeat words or phrases. These patients do not entirely lose their ability to comprehend, but they exhibit an increased effort of speech. This is because language comprehension is primarily a function of Wernicke's area, located in the posterior superior temporal gyrus. Therefore, they are typically aware of their deficits, and Broca aphasia patients are likely to become frustrated and often develop depression. It is also essential to differentiate dysphasia from dysarthria. Those with dysarthria have problems speaking because of an inability to move mouth and tongue musculature, while expressive aphasia is more issues with word-finding. [11] [12]
Document 7 (Title: Neurology_Adams): In contrast to Broca aphasia, the patient with Wernicke aphasia usually talks volubly, gestures freely, and appears strangely unaware of his deficit. Speech is produced mostly without effort; the phrases and sentences appear to be of normal length and are properly intoned and articulated. These attributes, in the context of aphasic disturbances, are referred to as “fluency” of speech (i.e., Wernicke aphasia is a fluent aphasia). Despite the fluency and normal prosody, the patient’s speech is remarkably devoid of meaning. The patient with Wernicke aphasia produces many nonsubstantive words, and the words themselves are often malformed or inappropriate, a disorder referred to as paraphasia. A phoneme (the minimal unit of sound recognizable as language) or a syllable may be substituted within a word (e.g., “The grass is greel”); this is called literal paraphasia. The substitution of one word for another (“The grass is blue”) is termed verbal paraphasia or semantic substitution and is
Document 8 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): most patients with MCI and some with clinically apparent AD, bedside screening tests may be normal, and a more challenging and comprehensive set of neuropsychological tests will be required. When the etiology for the dementia syndrome remains in doubt, a specially tailored evaluation should be performed that includes tasks of working and episodic memory, executive function, language, and visuospatial and perceptual abilities. In AD, the early deficits involve episodic memory, category generation (“name as many animals as you can in 1 minute”), and visuoconstructive ability. Usually deficits in verbal or visual episodic memory are the first neuropsychological abnormalities detected, and tasks that require the patient to recall a long list of words or a series of pictures after a predetermined delay will demonstrate deficits in most patients. In FTD, the earliest deficits on cognitive testing involve executive control or language (speech or naming) function, but some patients lack
Document 9 (Title: Neurology_Adams): If there is any suggestion of a speech or language disorder, the nature of the patient’s spontaneous speech should be noted. In addition, the accuracy of reading, writing, and spelling, executing spoken commands, repeating words and phrases spoken by the examiner, naming objects, and parts of objects should be assessed. The ability to carry out commanded tasks (praxis) is pertinent to the evaluation of several aspects of cortical function. For example, commonly used tests are carrying out commanded and imitated gestures such as hammering a nail, blowing out a candle, throwing dice and copying sequential hand positions. Visuospatial abilities may be tested by asking the patient to bisect a line, draw the numbers and hands of a clock face or the floor plan of one’s home or a map of one’s country, and copying figures. Recognition (gnosis) is tested by naming of objects or pictures and describing their use. Testing of Cranial Nerves
Document 10 (Title: Neurology_Adams): The term apraxia denotes a disorder in which an attentive patient loses the ability to execute previously learned activities in the absence of weakness, ataxia, sensory loss, or extrapyramidal derangement that would be adequate to explain the deficit. All the elements of the activity may be demonstrated in circumstances other than in response to the command to execute the activity or gesture. This was the meaning given to apraxia by Liepmann, who introduced the term in 1900, and discussed further by Denny-Brown in 1958.

Document 12 (Title: Neurology_Adams): In transcortical sensory aphasia the patient suffers a deficit of auditory and visual word comprehension, making writing and reading impossible, in every way conforming to Wernicke aphasia. Speech remains fluent, with marked paraphasia, anomia, and empty circumlocutions. However, unlike the deficit in Wernicke and conduction aphasias, the ability to repeat the spoken word is preserved. This facility in repetition may be of extreme degree, taking the form of echoing, parrot-like, word, phrases, and songs that are heard (echolalia). In a series of 15 such patients, CT and isotope scans have uniformly disclosed a lesion in the posterior parietooccipital region, according to Kertesz and colleagues. In general, this disorder has a good prognosis.
Document 13 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Conduction Aphasia Speech output is fluent but contains many phonemic paraphasias, comprehension of spoken language is intact, and repetition is severely impaired. Naming elicits phonemic paraphasias, and spelling is impaired. Reading aloud is impaired, but reading comprehension is preserved. The lesion sites spare the functionality of Broca’s and Wernicke’s areas but may induce a disconnection between the two. Occasionally, a transient Wernicke’s aphasia may rapidly resolve into a conduction aphasia. The paraphasic output in conduction aphasia interferes with the ability to express meaning, but this deficit is not nearly as severe as the one displayed by patients with Wernicke’s aphasia. Associated neurologic signs in conduction aphasia vary according to the primary lesion site. PART 2 Cardinal Manifestations and Presentation of Diseases
Document 14 (Title: Primary Progressive Aphasia -- History and Physical -- History and Physical Examination Features of SvPPA): Individuals with svPPA typically experience a gradual decline in their ability to understand and use words correctly, resulting in severe and progressive difficulties in word retrieval (anomia) and comprehension of single words. The patients' speech output is fluent. Naming and single-word comprehension deficits are more prominent for low-frequency or low-familiarity items (eg, "rhinoceros" vs. "dog") in the illness' earlier stages. [27] Patients often replace less frequent words with more familiar ones, typically using the superordinate category (eg, "animal" for "cat"). Anomia may also be observed in spontaneous speech, often empty and not very informative. [28]
Document 15 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): delay will demonstrate deficits in most patients. In FTD, the earliest deficits on cognitive testing involve executive control or language (speech or naming) function, but some patients lack either finding despite profound social-emotional deficits. PDD or DLB patients have more severe deficits in visuospatial function but do better on episodic memory tasks than patients with AD. Patients with vascular dementia often demonstrate a mixture of executive control and visuospatial deficits, with prominent psychomotor slowing. In delirium, the most prominent deficits involve attention, working memory, and executive function, making the assessment of other cognitive domains challenging and often uninformative.
