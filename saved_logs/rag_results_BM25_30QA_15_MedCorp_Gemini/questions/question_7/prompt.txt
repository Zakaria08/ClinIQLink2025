With your own knowledge and the help of the following document:

Document 1 (Title: Metronidazole -- Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes): There should be judicious prescribing of metronidazole by providers only for known indications and high clinical suspicion for needing treatment of anaerobic bacterial infections, protozoal infections, and microaerophilic bacterial infections. Overprescribing may contribute to increasing future antibiotic resistance to the drug, so a pharmacy consult is necessary for the prescriber to ensure directed therapy. The documentation already exists regarding increased resistance to metronidazole in the treatment of C. difficile infections. Also, prescribers, nurses, and pharmacists should routinely educate patients to abstain from alcoholic beverages while taking metronidazole, which will help lead to fewer disulfiram reaction symptoms; nursing will play a role in this monitoring and for other potential adverse effects. The patient should also be informed by the health care provider of the possible change in urine color while on this medicine. The team of health professionals, including physicians, physician assistants, nurses, and pharmacists, must work together to provide the best care for these patients when using metronidazole in any formulation. [Level 5]
Document 2 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): Adverse effects include nausea, diarrhea, stomatitis, and peripheral neuropathy with prolonged use. Metronidazole has a disulfiram-like effect, and patients should be instructed to avoid alcohol. Although teratogenic in some animals, metronidazole has not been associated with this effect in humans. Other properties of metronidazole are discussed in Chapter 52. A structurally similar agent, tinidazole, is a once-daily drug approved for treatment of trichomonas infection, giardiasis, amebiasis, and bacterial vaginosis. It also is active against anaerobic bacteria, but is not approved in the USA for treatment of anaerobic infections.
Document 3 (Title: Gynecology_Novak): Treatment Ideally, treatment of BV should inhibit anaerobes but not vaginal lactobacilli. The following treatments are effective: 1. Metronidazole, an antibiotic with excellent activity against anaerobes but poor activity against lactobacilli, is the drug of choice for the treatment of BV. A dose of 500 mg administered orally twice a day for 7 days should be used. Patients should be advised to avoid using alcohol during treatment with oral metronidazole and for 24 hours thereafter. 2. Metronidazole gel, 0.75%, one applicator (5 g) intravaginally once daily for 5 days, may also be prescribed. The overall cure rates range from 75% to 84% with the aforementioned regimens (16). Clindamycin in the following regimens is effective in treating BV: 1. Clindamycin ovules, 100 mg, intravaginally once at bedtime for 3 days 2. Clindamycin bioadhesive cream, 2%, 100 mg intravaginally in a single dose 3. Clindamycin cream, 2%, one applicator full (5 g) intravaginally at bedtime for 7 days 4.
Document 4 (Title: Antiparasitic Drugs -- Mechanism of Action -- Antiprotozoal Agents): Metronidazole and tinidazole are 5-nitroimidazole derivatives. Metronidazole has both antibacterial and antiprotozoal properties. It is active against amoebiasis and other protozoal diseases such as trichomoniasis and giardiasis. Within the parasites, it engages in redox reactions, releasing toxic reactive intermediates, making it effective as a luminal and extra-luminal amoebicide. The metronidazole metabolites are taken up by the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), leading to the DNA disruption and, consequently, protein synthesis inhibition. Tinidazole has a similar structure to metronidazole and shares a similar activity profile. However, tinidazole has a higher cure rate for protozoal infections and a better toxicity profile than metronidazole.
Document 5 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): Metronidazole is well absorbed after oral administration, is widely distributed in tissues, and reaches serum levels of 4–6 mcg/mL after a 250-mg oral dose. It can also be given intravenously. The drug penetrates well into the cerebrospinal fluid and brain, reaching levels similar to those in serum. Metronidazole is metabolized in the liver and may accumulate in hepatic insufficiency. Metronidazole is indicated for treatment of anaerobic or mixed intra-abdominal infections (in combination with other agents with activity against aerobic organisms), vaginitis (trichomonas infection, bacterial vaginosis), Clostridium difficile infection, and brain abscess. The typical dosage is 500 mg three times daily orally or intravenously (30 mg/kg/d). Vaginitis may respond to a single 2-g dose. A vaginal gel is available for topical use.
Document 6 (Title: Quinolones -- Indications): Quinolones are a class of broad-spectrum antibiotics with excellent oral bioavailability and can be used to treat a wide variety of bacterial infections. Their clinical utility is restricted, particularly in the outpatient setting, due to their potential for severe side effects. Due to these safety concerns, quinolones are not recommended as first-line agents by the FDA if there are other available antibiotic options with less potential for severe adverse events. There are currently four generations of quinolones. While initial quinolones were effective only against Gram-negative bacteria, succeeding generations gained activity against Pseudomonas sp ., Gram-positive, and atypical bacterial strains. Many different quinolones have undergone development, and among them, the ones currently approved by the FDA for systemic use include moxifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, gemifloxacin, levofloxacin, delafloxacin, and ofloxacin. A few key differences exist in the spectrum of activity between the quinolones. Ciprofloxacin is ineffective against S. pneumoniae . Moxifloxacin lacks sufficient activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa but is effective in treating anaerobes (along with delafloxacin). Delafloxacin is the only quinolone effective against methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). [1]
Document 7 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): The antibiotics used to treat anaerobic infections should be active against both aerobic and anaerobic organisms because many of these infections are of mixed etiology. Antibiotic regimens can usually be selected empirically on the basis of the type of infection, the species of the organisms usually present in such cases, the results of Gram’s staining, and a knowledge of antimicrobial resistance patterns (Chap. 170 and Table 201-2). Other factors influencing the selection of antibiotics include need for bactericidal activity and for penetration into certain organs (such as the brain), toxicity, and impact on the normal microbiota. Antibiotics active against clinically relevant anaerobes can be grouped into four categories based on their predicted activity (Table 201-2). Nearly all the drugs listed have toxic side effects, which are described in detail in Chap. 170.
Document 8 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): 1. Amebiasis—Metronidazole or tinidazole is the drug of choice in the treatment of all tissue infections with E histolytica. Neither drug is reliably effective against luminal parasites and so must be used with a luminal amebicide to ensure eradication of the infection. 2. Giardiasis—Metronidazole is the treatment of choice for giardiasis. The dosage for giardiasis is much lower than that for amebiasis, and the drug is thus better tolerated. Efficacy after a single treatment is about 90%. Tinidazole is at least equally effective, and can be used as a single dose. 3. Trichomoniasis—Metronidazole is the treatment of choice. A single dose of 2 g is effective. Metronidazole-resistant organisms can lead to treatment failures. Tinidazole may be effective against some of these resistant organisms.
Document 9 (Title: Dental Abscess -- Treatment / Management): Penicillins and cephalosporins can be used in odontogenic infections, but there is increasing antimicrobial resistance due to B-lactamase production. This increase in resistance would make using penicillins with other antimicrobials, such as metronidazole or an antibiotic with an extended spectrum, like ampicillin-sulbactam and ampicillin-clavulanate, more appropriate. Dosing: Ampicillin-sulbactam 3 g intravenously every 6 hours Dosing: Amoxicillin-clavulanate: 875 mg orally every 12 hours Dosing: Penicillin G 2 to 4  intravenously every 4 to 6 hours PLUS Metronidazole 500 mg intravenously or orally every 8 hours Dosing: Cefoxitin: 1 to 2 g intravenously every 4 hours Dosing: Cefotetan: 2 g intravenously every 12 hours
Document 10 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): A. Penicillin Penicillin G is a drug of choice for infections caused by streptococci, meningococci, some enterococci, penicillin-susceptible pneumococci, staphylococci confirmed to be non-β-lactamaseproducing, Treponema pallidum and certain other spirochetes, some Clostridium species, Actinomyces and certain other Gram-positive rods, and non-β-lactamase-producing Gram-negative anaerobic organisms. Depending on the organism, the site, and the severity of infection, effective doses range between 4 and 24 million units per day administered intravenously in four to six divided doses. High-dose penicillin G can also be given as a continuous intravenous infusion. Penicillin V, the oral form of penicillin, is indicated only in minor infections because of its relatively poor bioavailability, the need for dosing four times a day, and its narrow antibacterial spectrum. Amoxicillin (see below) is often used instead.
Document 11 (Title: Foscarnet -- Indications -- Off-Label Uses): Foscarnet also has off-label use in certain instances, such as gastrointestinal diseases including esophagitis or colitis, outer retinal necrosis, allogeneic stem cell transplant, varicella zoster virus (VZV) treatment, and even in the prevention of CMV infection itself. [3] [4] [1] Foscarnet is often administered as monotherapy or in combination with agents such as ganciclovir for CMV and acyclovir for HSV. When ganciclovir alone is ineffective, clinicians will often combine it with foscarnet. If ganciclovir therapy causes strong adverse effects in a patient, foscarnet is administered instead. [5] While foscarnet is often indicated for the above-mentioned viral infections in immunocompromised patients, it has no use in treating HIV because it does not have antiretroviral properties. Preemptive treatment with foscarnet for early human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) reactivation in allogeneic stem cell transplant patients effectively prevents complications, with no cases of encephalitis or pneumonitis. The treatment results in undetectable viral loads and minimal adverse effects, demonstrating a safe, effective strategy. [6] The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) acknowledges the potential use of foscarnet as an option for outpatient parenteral antibiotic therapy (OPAT) in select patients. [7]
Document 12 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): B. Oral Administration In preparation for elective bowel surgery, 1 g of neomycin may be given orally every 6–8 hours for 1–2 days, often combined with 1 g of erythromycin base. This reduces the aerobic bowel flora with little effect on anaerobes. In hepatic encephalopathy, coliform flora can be suppressed by giving 1 g every 6–8 hours together with reduced protein intake, thus reducing ammonia production. Use of neomycin for hepatic encephalopathy has been largely supplanted by lactulose and other medications that are less toxic. Use of paromomycin in the treatment of protozoal infections is discussed in Chapter 52. C. Intravenous and Intramuscular Administration
Document 13 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): 2. Amebic Colitis—Metronidazole plus a luminal amebicide is the treatment of choice for amebic colitis and dysentery. Tetracyclines and erythromycin are alternative drugs for moderate colitis but are not effective against extraintestinal disease. Dehydroemetine or emetine can also be used, but are best avoided because of toxicity. 3. Extraintestinal Infections—The treatment of choice for extraintestinal infections is metronidazole plus a luminal amebicide. A 10-day course of metronidazole cures over 95% of uncomplicated liver abscesses. For unusual cases in which initial therapy with metronidazole has failed, aspiration of the abscess and the addition of chloroquine to a repeat course of metronidazole should be considered. Dehydroemetine and emetine are toxic alternative drugs. TABLE 52–5 Treatment of amebiasis. Not all preparations are available in the USA.1 Clinical Setting Drugs of Choice and Adult Dosage Alternative Drugs and Adult Dosage
Document 14 (Title: Metronidazole -- Indications): Metronidazole is one of the mainstay drugs for the treatment of anaerobic bacterial infections, protozoal infections, and microaerophilic bacterial infections. It is cytotoxic to facultative anaerobic microorganisms.
Document 15 (Title: Metronidazole -- Toxicity): There have been reports of disulfiram-like reactions in patients drinking alcohol while administered systemic or vaginal metronidazole. A typical disulfiram reaction causes flushing, tachycardia, palpitations, nausea, and vomiting. Alcohol should be avoided during treatment and from up to forty-eight hours to fourteen days after treatment completion, depending on the source; the manufacturer's product information recommends avoiding alcohol ingestion during metronidazole therapy and for at least 48 hours afterward. Ethanol-containing medications such as elixirs and tipranavir, capsules, intravenous (IV) anidulafungin, IV trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and many cough/cold syrups can also lead to a disulfiram-like reaction when ingested with metronidazole.
