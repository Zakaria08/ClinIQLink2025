With your own knowledge and the help of the following document:

Document 1 (Title: Gynecology_Novak): 1. The perianal and perineal regions are common sites for itching. Pruritus ani is usually indicated by thickening, excoriations, and eczema of the perianal region and adjacent areas. 2. The anal opening often is the site of fissures, fistulae, and external hemorrhoids. 3. The pilonidal area may present a dimple, a sinus, or an inﬂamed pilonidal cyst. 2. Instruct the patient to “strain down” and note whether this technique brings into view previously concealed internal hemorrhoids, polyps, or a prolapsed rectal mucosa. 3. Palpate the pilonidal area, the ischiorectal fossa, the perineum, and the perianal region before inserting the gloved finger into the anal canal. Note the presence of any concealed induration or tenderness in any of these areas. 4.

Document 3 (Title: Gynecology_Novak): Anorectal Examination Visual and digital inspection of the vagina and anus will help to identify structural abnormalities such as prolapse, fistulas, fissures, hemorrhoids, or prior trauma. As previously mentioned, a rectovaginal examination provides useful information regarding the integrity of the rectovaginal septum and can demonstrate laxity in the support of the perineal body. The rectovaginal examination is helpful in the diagnosis of enteroceles, which can be felt as protrusion of bowel between the vaginal and rectal fingers with straining. Digital rectal examination should be performed at rest, with squeeze, and while straining. The presence of fecal material in the anal canal may suggest fecal impaction or neuromuscular weakness of the anal continence mechanism. Circumferential protrusion of the upper rectum around the examining finger during straining suggests intussusception, which often occurs in combination with laxity of the posterior rectal support along the sacrum.
Document 4 (Title: Radiation Therapy for Anal Cancer -- Differential Diagnosis): The differential diagnosis for anal cancer is broad and dependent upon its clinical presentation. Bright red blood per rectum may also be the result of hemorrhoids, polyps, diverticulosis, anal fissures, ulcers, abscess, or proctitis. A sizeable malignant mass at the anus may also originate from the rectum, bladder, prostate, or vagina.
Document 5 (Title: Gynecology_Novak): 4. Palpate the anal canal and rectum with a well-lubricated, gloved index finger. Lay the pulp of the index finger against the anal orifice and instruct the subject to strain downward. Concomitant with the patient’s downward straining (which tends to relax the external sphincter muscle), exert upward pressure until the sphincter is felt to yield. Then, with a slight rotary movement, insinuate the finger past the anal canal into the rectum. Examine the anal canal systematically before exploring the rectum. 5. Evaluate the anal canal for: a. Tonus of the external sphincter muscle and the anorectal ring at the anorectal junction b. Tenderness (usually caused by a tight sphincter, anal fissure, or painful hemorrhoids) c. Tumor or irregularities, especially at the pectinate line d. Superior aspect: Reach as far as you can. Mild straining by the patient may cause some lesions, which are out of reach of the finger, to descend sufficiently low to be detected by palpation. e.
Document 6 (Title: External Hemorrhoid -- Differential Diagnosis): When considering hemorrhoid disease as a diagnosis, one must give specific consideration to other potential anorectal pathologies. For example, anal fissures occur in the lower portion of the anal canal and typically yield pain and bleeding, worse with defecation. Anorectal abscesses can yield severe rectal pain and sometimes a palpable mass. These have the potential to result in life-threatening sepsis. Although rather uncommon, anal prolapse typically presents with pain during defecation, and the patient may report a palpable mass. Anal intercourse can result in proctitis that yields pain, bleeding, and even skin changes. Offending microbes include Chlamydia trachomatis , Neisseria gonorrhoeae , and Herpes simplex. Malignancy is a potential cause of blood per rectum that must be considered. If bleeding originates from hemorrhoid disease in a young, otherwise healthy patient, the complete colonic examination may be deferred in favor of a close follow-up. Patients with a family history of cancer or patients older than 49 years of age should be scheduled for a routine colonoscopy.
Document 7 (Title: Diverticulosis -- Differential Diagnosis): Diverticulosis presents with bleeding per rectum, and most of the time, that is the only presenting symptom. The differential diagnosis includes: Hemorrhoids Ulcers in the gut wall Inflammatory bowel disease Anal fissure Anal abscess or fistula Colonic polyps Colon cancer Constipation Radiation therapy Angiodysplasias Colitis Proctitis
Document 8 (Title: Perianal Abscess -- Differential Diagnosis): The differential diagnosis for a perianal abscess includes anal trauma, anal fissure, anal fistula, thrombosed external hemorrhoid, pilonidal cyst, buttocks abscess, cellulitis, Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, malignancy, proctitis, HIV/ AIDS, other sexually transmitted diseases, Bartholin’s abscess, and hidradenitis suppurativa.
Document 9 (Title: Anal Fissures -- Differential Diagnosis): An anal fissure is a clinical diagnosis made essentially by physical exam alone, which must be done to rule out other possible causes of rectal pain. Hemorrhoids are the most common finding in patients with rectal pain. However, only external hemorrhoids are painful, especially if they are thrombosed. Patients can also have perianal abscesses that cause pain on defecation and can bleed. Perianal abscesses can also form anal fistulas to a deeper site and either bleed or have purulent drainage. Patients with sexually transmitted infections, inflammatory bowel disease, or tuberculosis can form perianal ulcerations. A rare condition known as solitary rectal ulcer syndrome can also be encountered; however, this lesion has no known cause and is usually found by sigmoidoscopy, several centimeters proximal to the anus itself.
Document 10 (Title: Perirectal Abscess -- Differential Diagnosis): Differential diagnosis includes anal fissure, anal fistula, thrombosed hemorrhoid, pilonidal cyst, buttocks abscess, or cellulitis of the skin, Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, malignancy, proctitis, HIV/ AIDS, other sexually transmitted diseases, Bartholin’s abscess, and hidradenitis suppurativa.
Document 11 (Title: Gynecology_Novak): 6. Follow the bimanual examination with a rectovaginal–abdominal examination. Insert the index finger into the vagina and the middle finger into the rectum very gently. Place the other hand on the infraumbilical region. The use of this technique makes possible higher exploration of the pelvis because the cul-de-sac does not limit the depth of the examining finger. 7. In patients who have an intact hymen, examine the pelvic organs by the rectal–abdominal technique. Table 1.6 (Continued ) E. Rectal examination 1. Inspect the perianal and anal area, the pilonidal (sacrococcygeal) region, and the perineum for the following aspects: a. Color of the region (note that the perianal skin is more pigmented than the surrounding skin of the buttocks and is frequently thrown into radiating folds) b. 1. The perianal and perineal regions are common sites for itching. Pruritus ani is usually indicated by thickening, excoriations, and eczema of the perianal region and adjacent areas. 2.
Document 12 (Title: Anoscopy -- Indications): This procedure can be useful in individuals experiencing rectal/anal discomfort to evaluate for common lower gastrointestinal pathology which can cause pain such as anal fissures, sexually transmitted infection, anal condylomata, or bleeding such as internal hemorrhoids, rectal ulceration/inflammation, rectal varices or trauma. Anoscopy can be useful in evaluating for anal cancer, particularly in high-risk groups such as in men who have sex with men and have co-existing HIV infection. This translates to a lifetime risk of 7% to 8% in a male infected in his 20s. There are no current routine screening guidelines at this time. [5] [6] [7] [8] . Anoscopy will help visualize the anus, the anal canal, and the internal sphincter, it is usually used when the digital rectal examination is inconclusive. The following summarizes the indications for anoscopy
Document 13 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): Patients are often too tender to tolerate digital rectal examination, anoscopy, or proctoscopy. An acute fissure is a superficial tear of the distal anoderm and almost always heals with medical management. Chronic fissures develop ulceration and heaped-up edges with the white fibers of the internal anal sphincter visible at the base of the ulcer. There often is an associated external skin tag and/or a hypertrophied anal papilla internally. These fissures are more challenging to treat and may require surgery. A lateral loca-tion of a chronic anal fissure may be evidence of an underlying disease such as Crohn’s disease, HIV, syphilis, tuberculosis, or leukemia. If the diagnosis is in doubt or there is suspicion of another cause for the perianal pain such as abscess or fistula, an examination under anesthesia may be necessary.Treatment. Therapy focuses on breaking the cycle of pain, spasm, and ischemia thought to be responsible for development of fissure in ano. First-line therapy to
Document 14 (Title: Anoscopy -- Introduction): Anoscopy is a bedside procedure that is inexpensive, can be performed quickly without bowel preparation or the need for sedation. With this method, the examiner can visualize the internal portions of the anal sphincter and the distal rectum. Prospective studies suggest that anoscopy has a higher sensitivity for anorectal lesions such as internal hemorrhoids, proctitis, lacerations, fistulas, ulcers, and masses than a flexible sigmoidoscopy. Up to 50% of rectal bleeding can be falsely attributed to hemorrhoids without internal examination to confirm this diagnosis. [1] [2] [3] [4]
Document 15 (Title: Pediatrics_Nelson): be measured (with a tape measure), noting abnormal firmness or contour. A rectal examination, including inspection for fissures, skin tags, abscesses, and fistulous openings, should be performed for children with history suggesting constipation, GI bleeding, abdominal pain, chronic diarrhea, and suspicion of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Digital rectal examination should include assessment of anal sphincter tone, anal canal size and elasticity, tenderness, extrinsic masses, presence of fecal impaction, and caliber of the rectum. Stool should be tested for occult blood.
