Document 2 (Title: Construction of a fast, inexpensive rapid-scanning diode-array detector and spectrometer.): A 512-element diode-array spectroscopic detection system capable of acquiring multiple spectra at a rate of 5 ms per spectrum with an effective scan rate of 102.9 kHz has been constructed. Spectra with fewer diode elements can also be acquired at scan rates up to 128 kHz. The detector utilizes a Hamamatsu silicon photodiode-array sensor that is interfaced to Hamamatsu driver/amplifier and clock generator boards and a DRA laboratories 12-bit 160-kHz analog-to-digital converter. These are standard, commercially available devices which cost approximately $3500. The system is interfaced to and controlled by an IBM XT microcomputer. Detailed descriptions of the home-built detector housing and control/interface circuitry are presented and its application to the study of the reaction of horseradish peroxidase with hydrogen peroxide is demonstrated.
Document 3 (Title: Apache Point Observatory Lunar Laser-ranging Operation): The increased optical gain brings some problems due to the possibility of getting more than one returned photon per pulse. The most novel component of the APOLLO system is the integrated array of Single-Photon Avalanche Diodes (SPADs) used in the detector. This technology is needed to deal with multiple photon returns within each pulse. Most single photon detectors suffer from "dead time": they cannot detect a photon if it arrives soon after another. This means that if more than one photon comes back in a single pulse, a conventional single-photon detector would only record the arrival time of the first photon. However, the important quantity is the centroid of the time of all returned photons (assuming the pulse and reflectors are symmetrical), so any system that can return multiple photons per pulse must record the arrival times of each photon. In APOLLO, the incoming photons are spread over an array of independent detectors, which reduces the chance that two or more photons hit
Document 4 (Title: Miniature silicon diode matrix-detector for in vivo measurement of 133xenon disappearance in the canine myocardium following local tissue injection.): After local tissue depositioning of 133Xenon (133Xe) the regional washout is usually registered by a NaI(Tl) detector. The residual radioactivity of 133Xe is usually measured at its 81 keV photopeak. However, using small Silicon (Si) photodiodes it is feasible to measure only the low-energy activity in the X-ray energy range. In the myocardium of open chest dogs 133Xe washout measurements by a matrix of Si diodes composed in a 4 x 4 array and a conventional NaI(Tl) detector were carried out simultaneously. Fourteen separate pairs of measurements were performed in 3 dogs. When the Si-diodes in the matrix were selected individually in accordance to the position with reference to the diode with maximum count rate or pooled, comparisons could be made between the corresponding washout rate constants measured by the reference detector. In the correlation between the rate constants the intercepts with the y axis were not significantly different from zero allowing the correlation lines to be fitted through (0.0). The slope of the correlation line was close to unity. The registration of the low-X-ray energy of 133Xe by the Si-detectors is an alternative to the conventional high energy activity recording appearing from the gamma-energy of the photopeak. The detector matrix concept allows elimination of motion artefacts and indicator distribution in the myocardial tissue. Due to the uniformity and low cost of Si-diodes the perspective may be the introduction as a disposable transducer useful during cardiac surgery for example.
Document 5 (Title: Ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy): The basic parts of a spectrophotometer are a light source, a holder for the sample, a diffraction grating in a monochromator or a prism to separate the different wavelengths of light, and a detector. The radiation source is often a Tungsten filament (300–2500 nm), a deuterium arc lamp, which is continuous over the ultraviolet region (190–400 nm), Xenon arc lamp, which is continuous from 160 to 2,000 nm; or more recently, light emitting diodes (LED) for the visible wavelengths. The detector is typically a photomultiplier tube, a photodiode, a photodiode array or a charge-coupled device (CCD). Single photodiode detectors and photomultiplier tubes are used with scanning monochromators, which filter the light so that only light of a single wavelength reaches the detector at one time. The scanning monochromator moves the diffraction grating to "step-through" each wavelength so that its intensity may be measured as a function of wavelength. Fixed monochromators are used with CCDs and
Document 6 (Title: Crystal radio): The crystal detector demodulates the radio frequency signal, extracting the modulation (the audio signal which represents the sound waves) from the radio frequency carrier wave. In early receivers, a type of crystal detector often used was a "cat whisker detector". The point of contact between the wire and the crystal acted as a semiconductor diode. The cat whisker detector constituted a crude Schottky diode that allowed current to flow better in one direction than in the opposite direction. Modern crystal sets use modern semiconductor diodes. The crystal functions as an envelope detector, rectifying the alternating current radio signal to a pulsing direct current, the peaks of which trace out the audio signal, so it can be converted to sound by the earphone, which is connected to the detector.
Document 7 (Title: Detector (radio)): Amplitude modulation detectors Envelope detector One major technique is known as envelope detection. The simplest form of envelope detector is the diode detector that consists of a diode connected between the input and output of the circuit, with a resistor and capacitor in parallel from the output of the circuit to the ground to form a low pass filter. If the resistor and capacitor are correctly chosen, the output of this circuit will be a nearly identical voltage-shifted version of the original signal. An early form of envelope detector was the crystal detector, which was used in the crystal set radio receiver. A later version using a crystal diode is still used in crystal radio sets today. The limited frequency response of the headset eliminates the RF component, making the low pass filter unnecessary.
Document 8 (Title: Detector (radio)): Ratio detector The ratio detector is a variant of the Foster–Seeley discriminator, but one diode conducts in an opposite direction, and using a tertiary winding in the preceding transformer. The output in this case is taken between the sum of the diode voltages and the center tap. The output across the diodes is connected to a large value capacitor, which eliminates AM noise in the ratio detector output. The ratio detector has the advantage over the Foster–Seeley discriminator that it will not respond to AM signals, thus potentially saving a limiter stage; however the output is only 50% of the output of a discriminator for the same input signal. The ratio detector has wider bandwidth but more distortion than the Foster–Seeley discriminator.
Document 9 (Title: Neon lamp): A variant of the NE-2 type lamp for circuit applications, the NE-77, have three wire electrodes in the lamp (in a plane) instead of the usual two, the third for use as a control electrode. Detector Neon lamps have been historically used as microwave and millimeter-wave detectors ("plasma diodes" or glow discharge detectors (GDDs)) up to about 100 GHz or so and in such service were said to exhibit comparable sensitivity (of the order of a few 10s to perhaps 100 microvolts) to the familiar 1N23-type catwhisker-contacted silicon diodes once ubiquitous in microwave equipment. More recently it has been found that these lamps work well as detectors even at sub-millimeter ("terahertz") frequencies and they have been successfully used as pixels in several experimental imaging arrays at these wavelengths.
Document 10 (Title: Monitoring of haemoglobin-methyl isocyanate adduct by high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detector.): Carbamylation of haemoglobin by methyl isocyanate (MIC) was detected by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a photodiode array detector following cyclisation of the N-terminal valine into methyl isopropyl hydantoin (MIH). MIH was also synthesised by reaction of MIC with valine, the chromatographic conditions standardised and the spectrum derived by a photodiode array detector recorded for confirmation of the identity of MIH. This HPLC method is specific, sensitive and suitable for the detection of exposure of blood samples to methyl isocyanate.
Document 11 (Title: Envelope detector): In the case of FM, the transmitted has a constant envelope R(t) = R and can be ignored. However, many FM receivers measure the envelope anyway for received signal strength indication. Diode detector The simplest form of envelope detector is the diode detector which is shown above. A diode detector is simply a diode between the input and output of a circuit, connected to a resistor and capacitor in parallel from the output of the circuit to the ground. If the resistor and capacitor are correctly chosen, the output of this circuit should approximate a voltage-shifted version of the original (baseband) signal. A simple filter can then be applied to filter out the DC component. Precision detector An envelope detector can also be constructed using a precision rectifier feeding into a low-pass filter.
Document 12 (Title: Solar Anomalous and Magnetospheric Particle Explorer): The HILT experiment was designed to measure the charge, energy, and mass of cosmic rays in the energy range of about 8.0--310 MeV/nucleon. Specifically, the energy ranges were: Helium (He): 3.9--90 MeV/nucleon; Carbon (C): 7.2--160 MeV/nucleon; Oxygen (O): 8.3-310 MeV/nucleon; Neon (Ne): 9.1--250 MeV/nucleon; and, Iron (Fe): 11–90 Mev/nucleon. The instrument consisted of (a) an array of position sensitive proportional counters at the entrance, followed by (b) an ionization chamber, (c) another array of position sensitive proportional counters just before, (d) a coplanar, 10-element, solid state array of detectors. The detectors were backed by, (e) a large caesium iodide (CsI) scintillation counter which was viewed by four light sensitive diodes. The geometric factor was as large as 35 cm2-sr. The two position sensitive counters enabled computation of the exact length of the trajectory along the ionization chamber. Items (a), (b), and (c) were filled with flowing, isobutane gas at a
Document 13 (Title: Detector (radio)): After sound (amplitude modulation, AM) transmission began around 1920, the term evolved to mean a demodulator, (usually a vacuum tube) which extracted the audio signal from the radio frequency carrier wave. This is its current meaning, although modern detectors usually consist of semiconductor diodes, transistors, or integrated circuits. In a superheterodyne receiver the term is also sometimes used to refer to the mixer, the tube or transistor which converts the incoming radio frequency signal to the intermediate frequency. The mixer is called the first detector, while the demodulator that extracts the audio signal from the intermediate frequency is called the second detector. In microwave and millimeter wave technology the terms detector and crystal detector refer to waveguide or coaxial transmission line components, used for power or SWR measurement, that typically incorporate point contact diodes or surface barrier Schottky diodes. Amplitude modulation detectors
Document 14 (Title: Digital radiography): A high-density line-scan solid state detector is composed of a photostimulable barium fluorobromide doped with europium (BaFBr:Eu) or caesium bromide (CsBr) phosphor. The phosphor detector records the X-ray energy during exposure and is scanned by a laser diode to excite the stored energy which is released and read out by a digital image capture array of a CCD.
Document 15 (Title: Radio receiver design): Tuned radio frequency The tuned radio frequency receiver (TRF) consists of a radio frequency amplifier having one or more stages all tuned to the desired reception frequency. This is followed by a detector, typically an envelope detector using a diode, followed by audio amplification. This was developed after the invention of the triode vacuum tube, greatly improving the reception of radio signals using electronic amplification which had not previously been available. The greatly improved selectivity of the superheterodyne receiver overtook the TRF design in almost all applications, however the TRF design was still used as late as the 1960s among the cheaper "transistor radios" of that era.
