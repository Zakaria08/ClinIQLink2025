Document 1 (Title: Hypomimia): Hypomimia (masked facies, masking of facies, mask-like facial expression), a medical sign, is a reduced degree of facial expression. It can be caused by motor impairment (for example, weakness or paralysis of the facial muscles), as in Parkinson's disease, or by other causes, such as psychological or psychiatric factors (for example, if a patient does not feel emotions and thus does not show any expression). Persons receiving excessive Botox treatments and thus losing disproportionate facial expression features may be incorrectly identified as suffering from hypomimia.

Document 2 (Title: Chronic traumatic encephalopathy): Signs and symptoms Symptoms of CTE, which occur in four stages, generally appear eight to ten years after an individual experiences repetitive mild traumatic brain injuries. First-stage symptoms are confusion, disorientation, dizziness, and headaches. Second-stage symptoms include memory loss, social instability, impulsive behavior, and poor judgment. Third and fourth stages include progressive dementia, movement disorders, hypomimia, speech impediments, sensory processing disorder, tremors, vertigo, deafness, depression and suicidality.
Document 3 (Title: Emotional expression): Disorders There are a few disorders that show deficiency in emotional expression and response. These include alexithymia, autism, hypomimia and involuntary expression disorder. Effects Expressing emotions can have important effects on individuals’ well-being and relationships with others, depending on how and with whom the emotions are shared. Emotions convey information about our needs, where negative emotions can signal that a need has not been met and positive emotions signal that it has been meet. In some contexts, conveying this information can have a negative impact on an individual; for example, when others ignore or exploit those needs.
Document 4 (Title: Emotional expression): There is evidence that when individuals experience crisis and trauma, such as natural disaster, emotional expression is the coping mechanism that leads to better mental health following the event. This process requires accepting and engaging with the emotional experience in order to reflect on and make sense of them. This can then lead to increases in emotional tolerance, altruism, resilience, psychological flexibility, and community engagement. Furthermore, this process is most effective with done collectively. This research highlights the inherent adaptiveness of these emotional experiences, and the importance of engaging with them.

Document 5 (Title: Encephalopathy): Depending on the type and severity of encephalopathy, common neurological symptoms are loss of cognitive function, subtle personality changes, and an inability to concentrate. Other neurological signs may include dysarthria, hypomimia, problems with movements (they can be clumsy or slow), ataxia, tremor. Other neurological signs may include involuntary grasping and sucking motions, nystagmus (rapid, involuntary eye movement), jactitation (restlessness while in bed), and respiratory abnormalities such as Cheyne-Stokes respiration (cyclic waxing and waning of tidal volume), apneustic respirations and post-hypercapnic apnea. Focal neurological deficits are less common. Wernicke encephalopathy can co-occur with Korsakoff alcoholic syndrome, characterized by amnestic-confabulatory syndrome: retrograde amnesia, anterograde amnesia, confabulations (invented memories), poor recall and disorientation.
Document 6 (Title: Emotional expression): Some researchers argue that emotional intelligence is biological, while others say it is innate. Gunderman states that emotional intelligence is a learned and an instinctual skill. According to him, it can be cultivated through three means: learning more about it, drawing attention to it for oneself and others, and reading the works of authors he considers to be emotionally intelligent, such as Jane Austen and Leo Tolstoy. Through engaging in emotional expressions and regulation, it is contemplated more than before and brings forth considerable changes in life and attitude. Sy and Cote conducted a study that proved emotionally intelligent are more competent and perform better. Therefore, many companies are using "EI training programs" to increase matrix performance. Disorders There are a few disorders that show deficiency in emotional expression and response. These include alexithymia, autism, hypomimia and involuntary expression disorder.

Document 8 (Title: Relationship of neurological and psychological signs to physical and metabolic risk factors in elderly persons living in retirement facilities: a multidisciplinary approach.): A multidisciplinary study was performed on 128 elderly subjects living in retirement facilities to correlate the occurrence of neurological signs with the presence of physical or metabolic risk factors, and cognitive impairment. Primitive reflexes were significantly correlated with ankle/arm ratio, Hachinski dementia score, Plutchik GRS score, and hypomimia. The contemporary presence of snout reflex, glabella tap, and palmomental reflex was consistently associated with dementia.
Document 9 (Title: Dopaminergic hypothesis for retarded depression: a symptom profile for predicting therapeutical responses.): We assessed the therapeutical efficacy of various antidepressants (amineptine, minaprine and clomipramine) in patients affected by retarded depression. All patients exhibited symptoms of retardation, including hypokinesia, anergia, reduction of speech, increased salivation, hypersomnia, Parinaud's syndrome, reduced sexual activity, slowness, hypomimia, orthostatic hypotension, dysphagia and drowsiness. Antidepressant drugs were administered for a 6-week period in a randomized double-blind vs placebo design. The rank order of clinical effectiveness (amineptine much greater than minaprine greater than clomipramine greater than placebo) paralleled the specificity of antidepressants as dopaminomimetic agents. These results support the view that a reduced dopaminergic transmission contributes to the pathophysiology of retarded depression.
Document 10 (Title: [An unusual association of myasthenia gravis and Parkinsonism in a female patient with tuberculous lymphadenitis].): We report on a female patient who had a tumour below the mandibular, on the right side of the neck, aged 70 years. When she was 74 years old easy discomfort characterized by trembling of the hands while resting and moving to the target as well as a certain stiffness of the neck, appeared. Three years later, at the age of 77, she felt fatigue, ptosis, double vision, weakness of the jaws while chewing, speech and swallowing disturbances, and weakness of the legs, that led to disability. In such state of health the patient was admitted to hospital for medical examination. Hypomimia, rigor of the neck muscles, vesting tremor, and, above all, clearly marked signs of myasthenic weakness and fatigue of the extraocular, masseteric, mimic, and bulbar muscles and those of the limbs, but in a lesser degree, were found. With Tensilon test we registered a positive response, and by an electrophysiological examination we defined a myasthenic decrement under the repetitive stimulus. Biopsy of submandibular tumour and histologic analysis indicated tuberculous lymphadenitis. Most symptoms of the disease disappeared during the treatment with anticholinesterase drugs and amantadine.
Document 11 (Title: [Motor neuron disease with Parkinson's disease--case report].): The patient was a 64-year-old woman who showed muscle weakness and tremor of upper extremities and gait disturbance at the age of 62 years. The symptoms progressed and she was admitted to our hospital. Neurological examination revealed muscle weakness, muscle atrophy and fasciculation bilaterally in the upper extremities. The deep tendon reflexes were reduced in the upper extremities and increased in the lower extremities, but Babinski's sign was not present. There was mild hand tremor at rest (right greater than left). Muscle rigidity was also evident. Her gait was small-stepped and her trunk was bent forward. She showed hypomimia, but no dementia was detected. She died of respiratory failure 7 months after admission. The duration of the illness was about 2 years. At autopsy, macroscopic examination showed depigmentation of the substantia nigra and locus ceruleus, and atrophy of the anterior roots of the spinal cord. Microscopic examination revealed a few senile plaques in the temporal cortex. In the substantia nigra, the number of melanin-containing cells was decreased in its central parts. A few Lewy bodies were found in some of the remaining neurons, and melanin pigment migrated into the parenchyma. In the locus ceruleus and dorsal motor nucleus of vagus, abundant Lewy bodies and mild astrocytosis were seen. A few Lewy bodies were also seen in the nucleus raphe, nucleus basalis of Meynert and hypothalamic nuclei. Severe neuronal loss of the anterior horn cells was observed in the cervical segment, and to a lesser degree, in the lumbo-sacral segments. segments.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Document 13 (Title: Neurology_Adams): in the parkinsonian patient to 5 to 10/min, and with it there is a slight widening of the palpebral fissures, creating a stare. A reduction in movements of the small facial muscles imparts the characteristic expressionless “masked” appearance (hypomimia). When seated, the patient makes fewer small shifts and adjustments of position than the normal person (the above mentioned hypokinesia), and the fingers straighten and assume a flexed and adducted posture at the metacarpophalangeal joints.
Document 14 (Title: Neurology_Adams): or greatly reduced. In looking to one side, the eyes move, but not the head. In arising from a chair, there is a failure to make the usual small preliminary adjustments, such as pulling the feet back, putting the hands on the arms of the chair, and so forth. Blinking is infrequent. Saliva is swallowed less frequently and drooling results. The face lacks expressive mobility (“masked facies,” or hypomimia). Speech is rapid, mumbling (or “cluttered”), and monotonic, and the voice is soft.
Document 15 (Title: Neurology_Adams): The stiffness, slowness of movement, difficulty in turning and sitting down, and hypomimia may suggest a diagnosis of Parkinson disease. However, the facial expression of the PSP patient is more a matter of tonic grimace than of lack of movement, and the lack of tremor, the erect rather than stooped posture, and prominence of oculomotor abnormalities serve to distinguish the two disorders. The signs of pseudobulbar palsy are eventually prominent, and this feature, along with the eye movements, distinguishes the process most conspicuously from other degenerative conditions. The face becomes less expressive (“masked”), speech is slurred in a slowed spastic fashion, quite different from Parkinson disease, the mouth tends to be held open, and swallowing is difficult. Many patients complain of sleep disturbances. The total sleep time and REM sleep are reduced, and spontaneous awakenings during the night are more frequent and longer than in normal individuals of the same age. Complaints of
