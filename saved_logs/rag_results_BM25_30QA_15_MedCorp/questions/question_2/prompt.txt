Document 1 (Title: Sinus bradycardia): Sinus bradycardia is commonly seen in normal healthy persons and athletes in the absence of pathophysiological diseases or conditions. Different factors or etiologies could lead to the dysfunction of the sinus node, causing a malformation or prolongation of the impulse. In terms of pathophysiological diseases, sinus rhythm may be caused by: Diseases/Conditions: Acute myocardial infarction, carotid sinus syndrome, eating disorders (such as anorexia nervosa), rhodotoxin poisoning, hypothermia, hypothyroidism, infections (such as diphtheria, acute rheumatic fever, or viral myocarditis), intrinsic disease of the SA node (such as sick sinus syndrome), Roemheld syndrome, sleep apnea Physiological causes: Increased vagal tone, increased intracranial pressure Medications, most commonly: digitalis glycosides, beta-blockers, quinidine, adenosine, calcium channel blockers, class I antiarrhythmic agents, ivabradine, clonidine, reserpine, cimetidine, lithium, amitriptyline
Document 2 (Title: Amitriptyline): Amitriptyline should be used with caution in patients with epilepsy, impaired liver function, pheochromocytoma, urinary retention, prostate enlargement, hyperthyroidism, and pyloric stenosis. In patients with the rare condition of shallow anterior chamber of eyeball and narrow anterior chamber angle, amitriptyline may provoke attacks of acute glaucoma due to dilation of the pupil. It may aggravate psychosis, if used for depression with schizophrenia, or precipitate the switch to mania in those with bipolar disorder. CYP2D6 poor metabolizers should avoid amitriptyline due to increased side effects. If it is necessary to use it, half dose is recommended. Amitriptyline can be used during pregnancy and lactation, in the cases when SSRI do not work.
Document 3 (Title: Digoxin immune fab): Regulatory information and clinical studies Case series have reported benefits from anti‐digoxin Fab, but data regarding the response in acute or chronic poisoning are conflicting. Recent observational data support an effect in acute poisoning, but efficacy in chronic poisoning be minimally effective in alleviating cardiac toxicities in chronic digoxin poisoning. Data also support outcomes of acute digoxin poisoning without use of anti‐digoxin Fab. A case series of 147 patients showed that not all cases of acute digoxin overdose require anti‐digoxin Fab, nor should anti‐digoxin Fab dose be calculated based on ingested dose. In contrast, a higher mortality (7.6%) was noted in a case series of acute and chronic digoxin and digitoxin poisoning despite Fab being used first line. Further, a retrospective case‐controlled study of chronic digoxin poisoning did not observe a beneficial effect of anti‐digoxin Fab on mortality.
Document 4 (Title: Poison): Most biocides, including pesticides, are created to act as acute poisons to target organisms, although acute or less observable chronic poisoning can also occur in non-target organisms (secondary poisoning), including the humans who apply the biocides and other beneficial organisms. For example, the herbicide 2,4-D imitates the action of a plant hormone, which makes its lethal toxicity specific to plants. Indeed, 2,4-D is not a poison, but classified as "harmful" (EU). Many substances regarded as poisons are toxic only indirectly, by toxication. An example is "wood alcohol" or methanol, which is not poisonous itself, but is chemically converted to toxic formaldehyde and formic acid in the liver. Many drug molecules are made toxic in the liver, and the genetic variability of certain liver enzymes makes the toxicity of many compounds differ between individuals. Exposure to radioactive substances can produce radiation poisoning, an unrelated phenomenon.
Document 5 (Title: Nick Drake): At the inquest in December, the coroner stated that the cause of death was "Acute amitriptyline poisoning—self-administered when suffering from a depressive illness", and concluded a verdict of suicide. Although the verdict has been disputed by some of his friends and members of his family,Brown, M., "Nick Drake: the fragile genius", The Daily Telegraph, 25 November 2014. there is a widely held view that, accidental or not, Drake had by then "given up on life". Rodney described his son's death as unexpected and extraordinary; however, in a 1979 interview he said he had been "worried about Nick being so depressed. We used to hide away the aspirin and pills and things like that."
Document 6 (Title: Dialysis): Acute indications Indications for dialysis in a patient with acute kidney injury are summarized with the vowel mnemonic of "AEIOU": Acidemia from metabolic acidosis in situations in which correction with sodium bicarbonate is impractical or may result in fluid overload. Electrolyte abnormality, such as severe hyperkalemia, especially when combined with AKI. Intoxication, that is, acute poisoning with a dialyzable substance. These substances can be represented by the mnemonic SLIME: salicylic acid, lithium, isopropanol, magnesium-containing laxatives and ethylene glycol. Overload of fluid not expected to respond to treatment with diuretics Uremia complications, such as pericarditis, encephalopathy, or gastrointestinal bleeding.
Document 7 (Title: Mercury poisoning): Chelation therapy for acute inorganic mercury poisoning, a formerly common method, was done with DMSA, 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanesulfonic acid (DMPS), D-penicillamine (DPCN), or dimercaprol (BAL). Only DMSA is FDA-approved for use in children for treating mercury poisoning. However, several studies found no clear clinical benefit from DMSA treatment for poisoning due to mercury vapor. No chelator for methylmercury or ethylmercury is approved by the FDA; DMSA is the most frequently used for severe methylmercury poisoning, as it is given orally, has fewer side-effects, and has been found to be superior to BAL, DPCN, and DMPS. α-Lipoic acid (ALA) has been shown to be protective against acute mercury poisoning in several mammalian species when it is given soon after exposure; correct dosage is required, as inappropriate dosages increase toxicity. Although it has been hypothesized that frequent low dosages of ALA may have potential as a mercury chelator, studies in rats have been
Document 8 (Title: Fatal poisonings with antidepressants in Finland 1985-1987.): In Finland the majority of the users of antidepressants are women and old age people. In the 80's the number of fatal poisonings has increased. During the years 1985-1987 58% of these poisonings were women who belonged to the younger age group of the users. The older tricyclic drugs are known to be more toxic, at least in overdose, than the newer antidepressants especially when they are compared to mianserin. Of the latter, however, lately more serious side effects have been reported. For this reason the use of the different kinds of antidepressants in Finland had changed: the sales of doxepin and amitriptyline have increased and those of maprotiline and mianserin have decreased. To study the role of antidepressants in sudden and unexpected deaths the fatality ratio (defined as fatalities divided by defined daily doses per 1000 inhabitants/day) was calculated for four most prescribed antidepressants. As to the sales, amitriptyline has to be considered to be the leading antidepressant followed by doxepin, mianserin and maprotiline. As a detection in the forensic toxicological screening the sales related ratios showed that maprotiline was most commonly found followed by doxepin, amitriptyline and mianserin. When an antidepressant was the cause of death the fatality ratio was highest for doxepin (6.4) followed by maprotiline (4.3), amitriptyline (4.0) and mianserin (1). In cases of established suicides the order was the same again.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Document 9 (Title: Gyromitrin): Gyromitrin may not be considered especially toxic, which may lead people to underestimate its poisonous qualities. In Poland, from 1953 to 1962, there were 138 documented poisonings, only two of which were fatal. Of 706 calls to the Swedish poison center regarding Gyromitra mushrooms between 1994 and 2002, there were no fatalities. In the United States from 2001 to 2011, 448 calls to poison centers involved gyromitrin. The North American Mycological Association (NAMA) reported on 27 cases over 30 years, none of which were fatal. Although poisonings due to gyromitrin are not often fatal, it is still highly toxic to the liver. Of those 27 analyzed cases, nine developed liver injury; there were also three instances of acute kidney injury. As gyromitrin is not especially stable, most poisonings apparently occur from the consumption of the raw or insufficiently cooked "false morel" mushrooms.
Document 10 (Title: Cardioprotective effects of carbocromen in awake and anesthetized dogs with amitriptyline poisoning.): We studied the effects of the antianginal drug carbocromen (4 mg/kg bolus plus 80 micrograms/kg/min i.v.) on amitriptyline (400 micrograms/kg/min i.v.) toxicity. In anesthetized dogs, amitriptyline increased heart rate, left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic pressure, and the PR and QT intervals, the QRS complex, and the S-T segments of the peripheral electrocardiogram. Blood pressure, LV pressure, and LV dP/dtmax fell considerably. Survival time was 37 +/- 4 min in amitriptyline-treated dogs and 64 +/- 3 min (p less than 0.05) in those receiving amitriptyline plus carbocromen. The amount of amitriptyline consumed until death increased from 14.8 to 25.6 mg/kg (p less than 0.05) with carbocromen. In conscious dogs, the hemodynamic impact of intraatrial amitriptyline was similar to that in anesthetized animals, and changes in stroke volume resembled those of dP/dt. Cardiac output was not altered, and peripheral resistance decreased moderately. Carbocromen prevented most of the typical amitriptyline effects on the heart and circulation. Sustained ventricular arrhythmia occurred at 29 +/- 4 min with amitriptyline infusion but was delayed to 58 +/- 3 min (p less than 0.05) when carbocromen was added. These experiments demonstrate (a) amitriptyline intoxication produced ventricular tachyarrhythmia and cardiac failure if high agent concentrations were achieved; (b) these rhythm disorders were associated with slowing of intraventricular conduction, which could be enhanced by carbocromen; and (c) carbocromen might be an effective therapy for amitriptyline-caused arrhythmia with cardiovascular collapse.
Document 11 (Title: Poison): Poisoning Poisoning can be either acute or chronic, and caused by a variety of natural or synthetic substances. Substances that destroy tissue but do not absorb, such as lye, are classified as corrosives rather than poisons. Acute Acute poisoning is exposure to a poison on one occasion or during a short period of time. Symptoms develop in close relation to the exposure. Absorption of a poison is necessary for systemic poisoning. Furthermore, many common household medications are not labeled with skull and crossbones, although they can cause severe illness or even death. Poisoning can be caused by excessive consumption of generally safe substances, as in the case of water intoxication. Agents that act on the nervous system can paralyze in seconds or less, and include both biologically derived neurotoxins and so-called nerve gases, which may be synthesized for warfare or industry.
Document 12 (Title: Gray (unit)): Radiation poisoning Radiation poisoning: The gray is conventionally used to express the severity of what are known as "tissue effects" from doses received in acute exposure to high levels of ionizing radiation. These are effects that are certain to happen, as opposed to the uncertain effects of low levels of radiation that have a probability of causing damage. A whole-body acute exposure to 5 grays or more of high-energy radiation usually leads to death within 14 days. LD1 is 2.5 Gy, LD50 is 5 Gy and LD99 is 8 Gy. The LD50 dose represents 375 joules for a 75 kg adult. Absorbed dose in matter The gray is used to measure absorbed dose rates in non-tissue materials for processes such as radiation hardening, food irradiation and electron irradiation. Measuring and controlling the value of absorbed dose is vital to ensuring correct operation of these processes.
Document 13 (Title: Alcoholic polyneuropathy): Pain Painful dysesthesias caused by alcoholic polyneuropathy can be treated by using gabapentin or amitriptyline in combination with over-the-counter pain medications, such as aspirin, ibuprofen, or acetaminophen. Tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline, or carbamazepine may help stabbing pains and have central and peripheral anticholinergic and sedative effects. These agents have central effects on pain transmission and block the active reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin. Anticonvulsant drugs like gabapentin block the active reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin and have properties that relieve neuropathic pain. However, these medications take a few weeks to become effective and are rarely used in the treatment of acute pain. Topical analgesics like capsaicin may also relieve minor aches and pains of muscles and joints.
Document 14 (Title: Pesticide poisoning): Epidemiology Acute pesticide poisoning is a large-scale problem, especially in developing countries. "Most estimates concerning the extent of acute pesticide poisoning have been based on data from hospital admissions which would include only the more serious cases. The latest estimate by a WHO task group indicates that there may be 1 million serious unintentional poisonings each year and in addition 2 million people hospitalized for suicide attempts with pesticides. This necessarily reflects only a fraction of the real problem. On the basis of a survey of self-reported minor poisoning carried out in the Asian region, it is estimated that there could be as many as 25 million agricultural workers in the developing world suffering an episode of poisoning each year." In Canada in 2007 more than 6000 cases of acute pesticide poisoning occurred. Estimating the numbers of chronic poisonings worldwide is more difficult.
Document 15 (Title: Amitriptyline): Moderate evidence exists in favor of amitriptyline use for atypical facial pain. Amitriptyline is ineffective for HIV-associated neuropathy. Headache Amitriptyline is probably effective for the prevention of periodic migraine in adults. Amitriptyline is similar in efficacy to venlafaxine and topiramate but carries a higher burden of adverse effects than topiramate. For many patients, even very small doses of amitriptyline are helpful, which may allow to minimize the side effects. Amitriptyline is not significantly different from placebo when used for the prevention of migraine in children. Amitriptyline may reduce the frequency and duration of chronic tension headache, but it is associated with worse adverse effects than mirtazapine. Overall, amitriptyline is recommended for tension headache prophylaxis, along with lifestyle advice, which should include avoidance of analgesia and caffeine.
