        "title": "A common pathophysiology for full thickness rectal prolapse, anterior mucosal prolapse and solitary rectal ulcer.",
        "content": "Anorectal pressures at rest, during conscious contraction of the external sphincter, during serial distension of the rectum and during straining to inflate a balloon were measured in 56 patients (21 patients with full thickness rectal prolapse, 24 patients with anterior mucosal prolapse, 11 patients with solitary rectal ulcer) and in 30 normal subjects. Both basal and squeeze pressures were significantly lower in the three groups of patients compared with matched normal controls (P less than 0.05). During increases in intra-abdominal pressure, anal pressure remained above maximum rectal pressure (P less than 0.05) in normal controls, with the highest anal pressures being recorded in the most caudal anal channels. In contrast, anal pressures tended to be lower than rectal pressures during this manoeuvre in patients with rectal prolapse, anterior mucosal prolapse and solitary rectal ulcer, and the highest pressures were recorded in the channels nearest the rectum. During serial distension of the rectum, 64 per cent of patients with solitary rectal ulcer, 75 per cent with anterior mucosal prolapse and 76 per cent with rectal prolapse, but only 10 per cent of controls, showed repetitive rectal contractions. The highest anal pressure always remained higher than rectal pressure during rectal distension in normal subjects (P less than 0.05) but not in patients. The threshold rectal volume required to cause a desire to defaecate and the maximum tolerable volume were significantly lower (P less than 0.05) in each of the patient groups, compared with normal subjects. The similarity in the results from patients with rectal prolapse, anterior mucosal prolapse and solitary rectal ulcer support the hypothesis that they share a common pathophysiology. In each of the groups, the rectum is hypersensitive and hyper-reactive, and weakness of the anal sphincter creates the conditions for prolapse of the rectum to occur into or through the anal canal.",

        "content": "Examination A physical examination should involve at least an abdominal exam and rectal exam. Abdominal exam may reveal an abdominal mass if there is significant stool burden and may reveal abdominal discomfort. Rectal examination gives an impression of the anal sphincter tone and whether the lower rectum contains any feces or not. Rectal examination also gives information on the consistency of the stool, the presence of hemorrhoids, blood and whether any perineal irregularities are present including skin tags, fissures, anal warts. Physical examination is done manually by a physician and is used to guide which diagnostic tests to order. Diagnostic tests Functional constipation is common and does not warrant diagnostic testing. Imaging and laboratory tests are typically recommended for those with alarm signs or symptoms.",

        "title": "Urinary Obstruction and Stasis   Kidney",
        "content": "The pressure within the renal pelvis is normally close to zero. When this pressure increases because of obstruction or reflux, the pelvis and calyces dilate. The degree of hydronephrosis that develops depends on the duration, degree, and site of the obstruction (Figure 12\u20134). The higher the obstruction, the greater the effect on the kidney. If the renal pelvis is entirely intrarenal and the obstruction is at the ureteropelvic junction, all the pressure will be exerted on the parenchyma (Klein et al., 2010). If the renal pelvis is extrarenal, only part of the pressure produced by a ureteropelvic stenosis is exerted on the parenchyma; this is because the extrarenal pelvis is embedded in fat and dilates more readily, thus \"decompressing\" the hydronephrotic left renal pelvis. Low density mass (P) in the left renal sinus had an attenuation value similar to that of water, suggesting the correct diagnosis. Unless intravenous contrast material is used, differentiation from a peripelvic cyst may be difficult. In the earlier stages, the renal pelvic musculature undergoes compensatory hypertrophy in its effort to force urine past the obstruction. Later, however, the muscle becomes stretched and atonic and decompensated. The progression of hydronephrotic atrophy is as follows (Chevalier, 2010; Rodriguez, 2004): 1. The earliest changes in the development of hydronephrosis are seen in the calyces. The end of a normal calyx is concave because of the papilla that projects into it; with increased intrapelvic pressure, the fornices become blunt and rounded. With persistence of increased intrapelvic pressure, the papilla becomes flattened, then convex (clubbed) as a result of compression enhanced by ischemic atrophy (Figure 12\u20135). The parenchyma between the calyces is affected to a lesser extent. The changes in the renal parenchyma are due to (a) compression atrophy from increased intrapelvic pressure (more accentuated with intrarenal pelves) and (b) ischemic atrophy from hemodynamic changes, mainly manifested in arcuate vessels that run at the base of the pyramids parallel to the kidney outline and are more vulnerable to compression between the renal capsule and the centrally increasing intrapelvic pressure. 2. This spotty atrophy is caused by the nature of the blood supply of the kidney. The arterioles are end arteries; therefore, ischemia is most marked in the areas farthest from the interlobular arteries. As the back pressure increases, hydronephrosis progresses, with the cells nearest the main arteries exhibiting the greatest resistance. 3. This increased pressure is transmitted up the tubules. The tubules become dilated, and their cells atrophy from ischemia. It should be pointed out that a few instances of dilated renal pelves and calyces are not due to the presence of obstruction. Rarely, the renal cavities are congenitally capacious and thus simulate hydronephrosis. More commonly, hydronephrosis may occur in childhood owing to the back pressure associated with vesicoureteral reflux. If the valvular incompetence resolves (and this is common), some degree of the hydronephrotic changes may persist. These persisting changes may cause the physician to suspect the presence of obstruction, which may lead to unnecessary surgery. A radioisotope renogram to assess ureteral drainage function can be performed to determine whether organic obstruction is present. 4. Only in unilateral hydronephrosis are the advanced stages of hydronephrotic atrophy seen. Eventually, the kidney is completely destroyed and appears as a thin walled sac filled with clear fluid (water and electrolytes) or pus (Figure 12\u20136).",
