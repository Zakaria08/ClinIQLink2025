Document 1 (Title: Exploring novel pyrazole nitroimidazole hybrids): “Trichomoniasis, a prevalent sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by the protozoan Trichomonas vaginalis, has gained increased significance globally. Its relevance has grown in recent years due to its association with a heightened risk of acquiring and transmitting the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and other STIs. In addition, many publications have revealed a potential link between trichomoniasis and certain cancers. Metronidazole, a nitroimidazole compound developed over 50 years ago, remains the first choice drug for treatment. However, reports of genotoxicity and side effects underscore the necessity for new compounds to address this pressing global health concern. In this study, we synthesized ten pyrazole nitroimidazoles 1(a j) and 4 nitro 1 (hydroxyethyl) 1H imidazole 2, an analog of metronidazole, and assessed their trichomonacidal and cytotoxic effects. All compounds 1(a j) and 2 exhibited IC50 values ≤ 20 μM and ≤ 41 μM, after 24 h and 48 h, respectively. Compounds 1d (IC50 5.3 μM), 1e (IC50 4.8 μM), and 1i (IC50 5.2 μM) exhibited potencies equivalent to Metronidazole (IC50 4.9 μM), the reference drug, after 24 h. Notably, compound 1i showed high anti trichomonas activity after 24 h (IC50 5.2 μM) and 48 h (IC50 2.1 μM). Additionally, all compounds demonstrated either non cytotoxic to HeLa cells (CC50 > 100 μM) or low cytotoxicity (CC50 between 69 and 100 μM). These findings suggest that pyrazole nitroimidazole derivatives represent a promising heterocyclic system, serving as a potential lead for further optimization in trichomoniasis chemotherapy.
Document 2 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): Adverse effects include nausea, diarrhea, stomatitis, and peripheral neuropathy with prolonged use. Metronidazole has a disulfiram-like effect, and patients should be instructed to avoid alcohol. Although teratogenic in some animals, metronidazole has not been associated with this effect in humans. Other properties of metronidazole are discussed in Chapter 52. A structurally similar agent, tinidazole, is a once-daily drug approved for treatment of trichomonas infection, giardiasis, amebiasis, and bacterial vaginosis. It also is active against anaerobic bacteria, but is not approved in the USA for treatment of anaerobic infections.
Document 3 (Title: Guidelines for clinical care: anti-infective agents for intra-abdominal infection. A Surgical Infection Society policy statement.): Several antibiotics have been marketed for therapeutic use in intra-abdominal infection. Often, these agents do not provide a sufficient spectrum activity against both facultative and obligate anaerobic gram-negative organisms, or have certain toxic effects that would not otherwise support their use. Guidelines have been developed for selection of antibiotic therapy for intra-abdominal infections and are presented as a statement of the Surgical Infection Society endorsed by the Executive Council. These guidelines are restricted to infections derived from the gastrointestinal tract and deal with those microorganisms commonly seen in such infections. The recommendations are based on in vitro activity against enteric bacteria, experience in animal models, and documented efficacy in clinical trials. Other concerns regarding pharmacokinetics, mechanisms of action, microbial resistance, and safety were also used in the formation of these guidelines. For community-acquired infections of mild to moderate severity, single-agent therapy with cefoxitin, cefotetan, or cefmetazole or ticarcillin-clavulanic acid is recommended. For more severe infections, single-agent therapy with carbapenems (imipenem/cilastatin) or combination therapy with either a third-generation cephalosporin, a monobactam (aztreonam), or an aminoglycoside plus clindamycin or metronidazole is recommended. Regimens with little or no activity against facultative gram-negative rods or anaerobic gram-negative rods are not considered acceptable.
