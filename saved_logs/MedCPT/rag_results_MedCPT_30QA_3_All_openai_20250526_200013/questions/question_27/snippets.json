        "title": "[Optic nerve hemangioblastoma. Case report].",
        "content": "A solitary hemangioblastoma of the optic nerve was found in a 36-year-old male with a distinct family history of intracranial hemangioblastoma. The patient was admitted with complaints of visual loss and exophthalmos of the right eye. X-rays showed enlargement of the right optic canal. Right carotid angiography revealed a hypervascular tumor in the orbital apex, supplied by the ophthalmic artery. Computed tomography disclosed a pear-shaped, isodense mass with moderate contrast enhancement in the orbital apex. The right optic nerve was enlarged along its entire course and was involved with the apical mass. Surgery via the right frontal extradural approach disclosed a solid, vascular tumor involving the optic nerve at the apex of the orbit. Histological examination showed the tumor to be a characteristic hemangioblastoma. Over 90% of intracranial hemangioblastomas are located in the posterior fossa. Supratentorial hemangioblastomas, especially those arising in the optic nerve, are extremely rare. In addition, optic nerve hemangioblastomas are frequently familial and are associated with infratentorial hemangioblastomas, angiomatosis retinae, and cysts of the abdominal viscera.",

        "title": "Comparison of Landolt C and Snellen E Acuity in Strabismus Amblyopia",
        "content": "Purpose: Assessment of visual acuity depends on the optotypes used for measurement. The ability to recognize different optotypes differs even if their critical detail appears under the same visual angle. Since optotypes are evaluated on individuals with good visual acuity and without eye disorders, differences in the lower visual acuity range cannot be excluded. In this study, visual acuity measured with the Snellen E was compared to the Landolt C acuity. Methods: 100 patients (age 8\u201390 years, median 60.5 years) with different eye disorders, among them 39 with amblyopia due to strabismus, and 13 healthy volunteers (age 18\u201333 years, median 24 years) were tested. Visual acuity assessment was performed using charts with the Snellen E and the Landolt C (Precision Vision) which mimic the ETDRS charts. 3 out of 5 optotypes per line had to be correctly identified, while wrong answers were monitored. In the group of patients, the eyes with the lower visual acuity, and for the healthy subjects, the right eyes were evaluated. Results: Differences between Landolt C and Snellen E acuity were small. The mean decimal values for Landolt C and Snellen E were 0.25\u00b10.4 and 0.29\u00b10.4 in the entire group and 0.14\u00b10.8 and 0.16\u00b10.8 for the eyes with strabismus amblyopia. The mean difference between Landolt C and Snellen E was 0.55 lines in the entire group and 0.55 lines for the eyes with strabismus amblyopia, with higher values for the Snellen E in both groups. In the acuity range below 0.1, the mean difference between Landolt C and Snellen E was 0.58 lines for the entire group and 0.58 lines for the eyes with strabismic amblyopia with higher values for the Snellen E in both groups. Conclusions: Using the charts described, there was a slight overestimation of visual acuity by the Snellen E compared to the Landolt C, even in strabismus amblyopia. Small differences in the lower visual acuity range have to be considered.",

        "content": "Arterial supply to the eye is\u00a0via the\u00a0ophthalmic artery, a branch of the cavernous portion of the internal carotid artery. The central retinal artery enters the globe along with the optic nerve and serves the inner layers of the retina through its many branches. Fifteen percent to 30% of the population have a cilioretinal artery, part of the choroidal arterial supply. This supplies the area of the retina around the macula, which is the central vision area. Patients with a cilioretinal artery may still have preserved central vision because this portion of the retina is still being perfused.",
