        "title": "IDL, VLDL, chylomicrons and atherosclerosis.",
        "content": "In humans with the lipoprotein lipase deficiency disorder large amounts of chylomicrons and large very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) accumulate in plasma. In spite of this, atherosclerosis does not seem to develop at an accelerated rate, suggesting that these lipoproteins do not promote atherogenesis. In humans with dysbetalipoproteinemia remnant lipoproteins (intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL) plus beta-VLDL) accumulate in plasma and these particles may therefore be the factor causing accelerated atherosclerosis in this disorder. Epidemiological studies in humans suggest that IDL or remnant lipoproteins are predictors of the severity or progression of atherosclerosis. Similar studies in the St. Thomas' Hospital rabbit strain, an animal model with genetically elevated plasma levels of VLDL, IDL and low-density lipoprotein (LDL), showed that IDL or remnant lipoproteins were better predictors of the extent of atherosclerosis than were LDL or VLDL. Studies of lipoprotein/arterial wall interactions have demonstrated that the larger the lipoprotein particle, the lower the influx into intima. Very large VLDL and chylomicrons do not seem to enter intima. Although high-density lipoprotein (HDL) enters intima faster than other lipoproteins, the small HDL particles seem to penetrate the entire arterial wall and leave via lymphatics and vasa vasorum in the outer media and adventitia. In contrast, LDL, and possibly also IDL and smaller VLDL, may only leave the intima via the lumen of the artery. In conclusion, a substantial body of evidence suggests that remnant lipoproteins (IDL and smaller VLDL) share with LDL the potential for promoting atherosclerosis, whereas very large VLDL and chylomicrons do not seem to have this effect.",

        "title": "Growth promoting effects of IGF-1",
        "content": "The first demonstration that exogenous IGF-1 stimulates growth was the administration of purified hormone to hypophysectomised rats. After the biosynthesis of IGF-1 identical to the native hormone, trials of its use in humans were begun; first in adults and then in children. Our group was the first to introduce long term administration of biosynthetic IGF-1 to children with primary IGF-1 deficiency\u2014primary GH insensitivity or LS. The finding that daily IGF-1 administration raises serum alkaline phosphatase, which is an indicator of osteoblastic activity, and serum procollagen, in addition to IGFBP-3, led to long term treatment. Treatment of patients with LS was also initiated in other parts of the world. The difference between us and the other groups was that we used a once daily dose, whereas the others administered IGF-1 twice daily. Table 1 compares the linear growth response of children with LS treated by four different groups. It can be seen that before treatment the mean growth velocity was 3\u20134.7 cm/year and that this increased after IGF-1 treatment to 8.2\u20139.1 cm/year, followed by a lower velocity of 5.5\u20136.4 cm/year in the next two years. (In GH treatment the highest growth velocity registered is also in the first year of treatment.) Figure 5 illustrates the growth response to IGF-1 in eight children during the first years of treatment. Ranke and colleagues reported that two of their patients had reached the third centile (Tanner), as did the patient of Krzisnik and Battelino; however, most patients did not reach a normal final height. The reasons may be late initiation of treatment, irregular IGF-1 administration, underdosage, etc. Ranke et al conclude that long term treatment of patients with LS promoted growth and, if treatment is started at an early age, there is a considerable potential for achieving height normalisation. Because no patient in our group was treated since early infancy to final height we cannot confirm this opinion. When the growth response to GH treatment in infants with IGHD was compared with that of IGF-1 in infants with LS we found that the infants with IGHD responded faster and better than those with LS. However, the small number of patients and the differences in growth retardation between the two groups makes it difficult to reach a conclusion. Both hormones stimulated linear growth, but GH seemed more effective than IGF-1. One cause may be the greater growth deficit of the infants with LS than those with IGHD, an insufficient dose of IGF-1, or that there is a need for some GH to provide an adequate stem cell population of prechondrocytes to enable full expression of the growth promoting action of IGF-1, as postulated by Green and colleagues and Ohlson et al. All the above findings based on a few clinical studies with small groups of patients and a few experimental studies remain at present controversial. The crucial question is whether there are any, and if so, whether there are sufficient IGF-1 receptors in the \u201cprogenitor cartilage zone\u201d of the epiphyseal cartilage to respond to endocrine and exogenous IGF-1. Using the mandibular condyle of 2 day old ICR mice, Maor et al showed that these condyles, which resemble the epiphyseal plates of the long bones, contain IGF-1 and high affinity IGF-1 receptors also in the chondroprogenitor cell layers, which enables them to respond to IGF-1 in vitro. Sims et al, using mice with GH receptor KO, showed that IGF-1 administration stimulates the growth (width) of the tibial growth plate and that IGF-1 has a GH independent effect on the growth plate. These findings are similar to those found when treating hypophysectomised rats with IGF-1. In conclusion, IGF-1 is an important growth hormone, mediating the anabolic and linear growth promoting effect of pituitary GH protein. It has a GH independent growth stimulating effect, which with respect to cartilage cells is possibly optimised by the synergistic action with GH.",
