        "title": "A short stay or 23 hour ward in a general and academic childrens hospital Are they effective",
        "content": "Objective: We evaluated the usefulness of a short stay or 23 hour ward in a pediatric unit of a large teaching hospital, Westmead Hospital, and an academic Children\u2019s hospital, The New Children\u2019s Hospital, to determine if they are a useful addition to the emergency service. Methods: This is a descriptive comparison of prospectively collected data on all children admitted to the short stay ward at Westmead Hospital (WH) during 1994 and the short stay ward at the New Children\u2019s Hospital (NCH) during 1997\u201398. These hospitals service an identical demographic area with the latter (NCH) a tertiary referral center. The following outcome measures were used: length of stay, appropriateness of stay, rate of admission to an in hospital bed, and rate of unscheduled visits within 72 hours of discharge. Adverse events were reported and patient follow up was attempted at 48 hours after discharge in all cases. Results: The short stay ward accounted for 10.3% (Westmead Hospital) and 14.7% (New Children\u2019s Hospital) of admissions, with 56% medical in nature, 30% surgical, and the remainder procedural or psychological. Admission patterns were similar, with asthma, gastroenteritis, convulsion, pneumonia, and simple surgical conditions accounting for most short stay ward admissions. The short stay ward increased hospital efficiency with an average length of stay of 17.5 hours (Westmead Hospital) compared to 20.5 hours (New Children\u2019s Hospital). The users of the short stay ward were children of young age less than 2 years, with stay greater than 23 hours reported in only 1% of all admissions to the short stay ward. The rate of patient admission to an in hospital bed was low, (4% [Westmead Hospital] compared to 6% [New Children\u2019s Hospital]), with the number of unscheduled visits within 72 hours of short stay ward discharge less than 1%. There were no adverse events reported at either short stay ward, with parental satisfaction high. The short stay ward was developed through reallocation of resources from within the hospital to the short stay ward. This resulted in estimated savings of $1/2 million (Westmead Hospital) to $2.3 million (New Children\u2019s Hospital) to the hospital, due to more efficient bed usage. Conclusion: This data demonstrates the robust nature of the short stay ward. At these two very different institutions we have shown improved bed efficient and patient care in a cost effective way. We have also reported on greater parental satisfaction and early return of the child with their family to the community.",

Retrospective study consisting of a one in three sample of all children admitted to the hospital's general medical units over one year. All admissions were listed sequentially, and every third patient was included in the study. Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne; a tertiary paediatric hospital with a major primary care role. There were a total of 660 patients eligible for inclusion in the study; 220 were selected, and all records were reviewed. It was found that although 87.7% of admissions could be justified on medical grounds alone, the children quickly recovered with at least 65% being fit for discharge within 12 hours of admission. In spite of this the mean duration of admission was 17.0 hours. The majority of patients were suffering from easily diagnosed and treated disorders, with 78.9% falling into four diagnostic groups (asthma, ingestions, infections, and convulsions). Criteria for admission to a short stay observation area were satisfied in 65% of patients (at the time of the study no such area existed in the hospital). No patients were discharged inappropriately early. A significant number of children require brief hospitalisation for relatively minor illness, but unnecessary delays caused by administrative aspects of hospital admission and relatively infrequent inpatient review by medical staff often lengthen the period of admission. Significant cost savings are possible with the use of a short stay facility, and a large number of patients are suitable for this form of care.",
