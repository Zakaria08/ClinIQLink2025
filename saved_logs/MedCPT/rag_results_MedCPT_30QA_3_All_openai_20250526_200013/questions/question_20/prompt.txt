Document 1 (Title: Ethylene glycol poisoning): Signs and symptoms Signs of ethylene glycol poisoning depend upon the time after ingestion. Symptoms usually follow a three step progression, although poisoned individuals will not always develop each stage. Stage 1 (30 minutes to 12 hours) consists of neurological and gastrointestinal symptoms and looks similar to alcohol poisoning. Poisoned individuals may appear to be intoxicated, dizzy, lacking coordination of muscle movements, drooling, depressed, and have slurred speech, seizures, abnormal eye movements, headaches, and confusion. Irritation to the stomach may cause nausea and vomiting. Also seen are excessive thirst and urination. Over time, the body metabolizes ethylene glycol into other toxins. Stage 2 (12 to 36 hours) where signs of “alcohol” poisoning appear to resolve, underlying severe internal damage is still occurring. An elevated heart rate, hyperventilation or increased breathing effort, and dehydration may start to develop, along with high blood pressure and metabolic acidosis. These symptoms are a result of accumulation of organic acids formed by the metabolism of ethylene glycol. Additionally low calcium concentrations in the blood, overactive muscle reflexes, muscle spasms, QT interval prolongation, and congestive heart failure may occur. If untreated, death most commonly occurs during this period. Stage 3 (24 to 72 hours) kidney failure is the result of ethylene glycol poisoning. In cats, this stage occurs 12–24 hours after consuming antifreeze; in dogs, at 36–72 hours after consuming antifreeze. During this stage, severe kidney failure is developing secondary to calcium oxalate crystals forming in the kidneys. Severe lethargy, coma, depression, vomiting, seizures, drooling, and inappetence may be seen. Other symptoms include acute tubular necrosis, red blood cells in the urine, excess proteins in the urine, lower back pain, decreased or absent production of urine, elevated blood concentration of potassium, and acute kidney failure. If kidney failure occurs it is typically reversible, although weeks or months of supportive care including hemodialysis may be required before kidney function returns.
Document 2 (Title: [Acute poisoning with ethylene glycol esters].): The study was performed of 13 acute oral poisonings with ethylene glycol ethers characterized as moderate or severe and resulting in poor outcome in 3 cases. Ethyl ether was responsible for 3 poisonings, methyl ether for 10 ones. It was found, that the intoxication had four stages or periods (initial, latent, clinical, recovery) and presented with CNS impairment, gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal disorders, decompensated metabolic acidosis, etc. The paper describes two clinical cases and experimental toxicity of cellosolves as well as the effect of the inhibitor of isovaleric acid amide alcohol dehydrogenase on animal lethality. The results obtained support the suggestion of ADH-participated metabolic activation of cellosolves in the body. The prospects of further studies into intoxication pathogenesis and new opportunities for relevant poisoning management are outlined.
Document 3 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): Three stages of ethylene glycol overdose occur. Within the first few hours after ingestion, there is transient excitation followed by CNS depression. After a delay of 4–12 hours, severe metabolic acidosis develops from accumulation of acid metabolites and lactate. Finally, deposition of oxalate crystals in renal tubules occurs, followed by delayed renal insufficiency. The key to the diagnosis of ethylene glycol poisoning is recognition of anion gap acidosis, osmolar gap, and oxalate crystals in the urine in a patient without visual symptoms.
