Document 1 (Title: Etomidate): Pharmacokinetics At the typical dose, anesthesia is induced for the duration of about 5–10 minutes, though the half-life of drug metabolism is about 75 minutes, because etomidate is redistributed from the plasma to other tissues. Onset of action: 30–60 seconds Peak effect: 1 minute Duration: 3–5 minutes; terminated by redistribution Distribution: Vd: 2–4.5 L/kg Protein binding: 76% Metabolism: Hepatic and plasma esterases Half-life distribution: 2.7 minutes Half-life redistribution: 29 minutes Half-life elimination: 2.9 to 5.3 hours Metabolism Etomidate is highly protein-bound in blood plasma and is metabolised by hepatic and plasma esterases to inactive products. It exhibits a biexponential decline.
Document 2 (Title: Posttraumatic Stress Disorder -- Evaluation -- Criterion F: Duration): Persistence of symptoms in Criterion B, C, D, and E for more than 1 month Criterion G: The disturbance causes significant functional impairment or distress in various areas of life, such as social or occupational. Criterion H: The disturbance is not attributable to substance use, medication, or another medical illness. [47]
Document 3 (Title: Remifentanil versus alfentanil comparative pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in healthy adult male volunteers): Background: Remifentanil is an esterase metabolized opioid with a rapid clearance. The aim of this study was to contrast the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of remifentanil and alfentanil in healthy, adult male volunteers. Methods: Ten volunteers received infusions of remifentanil and alfentanil on separate study sessions using a randomized, open label crossover design. Arterial blood samples were analyzed to determine drug blood concentrations. The electroencephalogram was employed as the measure of drug effect. The pharmacokinetics were characterized using a moment analysis, a nonlinear mixed effects model (NONMEM) population analysis, and context sensitive half time computer simulations. After processing the raw electroencephalogram to obtain the spectral edge parameter, the pharmacodynamics were characterized using an effect compartment, inhibitory maximum effect model. Results: Pharmacokinetically, the two drugs are similar in terms of steady state distribution volume (VD(SS)), but remifentanil's central clearance (CLc) is substantially greater. The NONMEM analysis population pharmacokinetic parameters for remifentanil include a CLc of 2.9 l × min⁻¹, a VDss of 21.81, and a terminal half life of 35.1 min. Corresponding NONMEM parameters for alfentanil are 0.36 l × min⁻¹, 34.11, and 94.5 min. Pharmacodynamically, the drugs are similar in terms of the time required for equilibration between blood and the effect site concentrations, as evidenced by a T₁₂k(e0) for remifentanil of 0.75 min [corrected] and 0.96 min for alfentanil. However, remifentanil is 19 times more potent than alfentanil, with an effective concentration for 50% maximal effect of 19.9 ng × ml⁻¹ versus 375.9 ng × ml⁻¹ for alfentanil. Conclusions: Compared to alfentanil, the high clearance of remifentanil, combined with its small steady state distribution volume, results in a rapid decline in blood concentration after termination of an infusion. With the exception of remifentanil's nearly 20 times greater potency (30 times if alfentanil partitioning between whole blood and plasma is considered), the drugs are pharmacodynamically similar.
