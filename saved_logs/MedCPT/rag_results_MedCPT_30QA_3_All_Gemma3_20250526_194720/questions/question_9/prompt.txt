Document 1 (Title: NADPH-dependent beta-oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids with double bonds extending from odd-numbered carbon atoms.): The mitochondrial metabolism of 5-enoyl-CoAs, which are formed during the beta-oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids with double bonds extending from odd-numbered carbon atoms, was studied with mitochondrial extracts and purified enzymes of beta-oxidation. Metabolites were identified spectrophotometrically and by high performance liquid chromatography. 5-cis-Octenoyl-CoA, a putative metabolite of linolenic acid, was efficiently dehydrogenated by medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (EC 1.3.99.3) to 2-trans-5-cis-octadienoyl-CoA, which was isomerized to 3,5-octadienoyl-CoA either by mitochondrial delta 3,delta 2-enoyl-CoA isomerase (EC 5.3.3.8) or by peroxisomal trifunctional enzyme. Further isomerization of 3,5-octadienoyl-CoA to 2-trans-4-trans-octadienoyl-CoA in the presence of soluble extracts of either rat liver or rat heart mitochondria was observed and attributed to a delta 3,5,delta 2,4-dienoyl-CoA isomerase. Qualitatively similar results were obtained with 2-trans-5-trans-octadienoyl-CoA formed by dehydrogenation of 5-trans-octenoyl-CoA. 2-trans-4-trans-Octadienoyl-CoA was a substrate for NADPH-dependent 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase (EC 1.3.1.34). A soluble extract of rat liver mitochondria catalyzed the isomerization of 2-trans-5-cis-octadienoyl-CoA to 2-trans-4-trans-octadienoyl-CoA, which upon addition of NADPH, NAD+, and CoA was chain-shortened to hexanoyl-CoA, butyryl-CoA, and acetyl-CoA. Thus we conclude that odd-numbered double bonds, like even-numbered double bonds, can be reductively removed during the beta-oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids.
Document 2 (Title: Biochemistry Fatty Acid Oxidation): The catabolism of saturated fatty acids through beta-oxidation does not directly produce trans-alpha-beta unsaturated metabolites. Instead, the initial step of beta-oxidation creates a trans double bond between the alpha and beta carbons, which is then followed by further steps that ultimately lead to acetyl-CoA. 20.6 Stage II of Lipid Catabolism | The Basics of General ... Here's a more detailed explanation: Beta-oxidation: This is the main pathway for breaking down fatty acids in the body. It occurs in the mitochondria and involves a series of reactions that cleave two carbons from the fatty acid at a time. First step: The first step of beta-oxidation is the dehydrogenation of the fatty acid, which introduces a trans double bond between the alpha and beta carbons of the fatty acyl-CoA. This step is catalyzed by acyl-CoA dehydrogenase and produces trans-delta-2-enoyl-CoA. Subsequent steps: After the formation of the trans double bond, the fatty acid is then hydrated, oxidized, and cleaved to release acetyl-CoA and a shorter fatty acyl-CoA. No trans-alpha-beta unsaturated metabolites: While the initial step does create a trans double bond, the subsequent steps in beta-oxidation do not result in the accumulation of trans-alpha-beta unsaturated metabolites. The trans double bond is part of the overall process of breaking down the fatty acid, not a product that is formed. In summary, the catabolism of saturated fatty acids through beta-oxidation does involve the formation of a trans double bond initially, but the final products are acetyl-CoA and a shorter fatty acyl-CoA, not trans-alpha-beta unsaturated metabolites.
Document 3 (Title: Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase): Acyl-CoA dehydrogenases (ACADs) are a class of enzymes that function to catalyze the initial step in each cycle of fatty acid β-oxidation in the mitochondria of cells. Their action results in the introduction of a trans double-bond between C2 (α) and C3 (β) of the acyl-CoA thioester substrate. Flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) is a required co-factor in addition to the presence of an active site glutamate in order for the enzyme to function. The following reaction is the oxidation of the fatty acid by FAD to afford an α,β-unsaturated fatty acid thioester of Coenzyme A: ACADs can be categorized into three distinct groups based on their specificity for short-, medium-, or long-chain fatty acid acyl-CoA substrates. While different dehydrogenases target fatty acids of varying chain length, all types of ACADs are mechanistically similar. Differences in the enzyme occur based on the location of the active site along the amino acid sequence.
