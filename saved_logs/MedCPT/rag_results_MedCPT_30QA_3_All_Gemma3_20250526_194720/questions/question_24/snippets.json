        "content": "Infectious mononucleosis is a syndrome characterized by fever, pharyngitis/tonsillitis, lymphadenopathy, and peripheral atypical lymphocytosis. Etiologic agents: Ninety percent of cases of typical mononucleosis are caused by the Epstein Barr virus (EBV) from the Herpesviridae family. The virus first infects oropharyngeal epithelial cells and B cells. Some of these B cells are transformed into immortal plasma cells and are triggered to produce polyclonal gamma globulins, which are detected as nonspecific heterophile antibodies. The activated B cells, which are visualized as atypical lymphocytes, stimulate proliferation of T cells, leading to the enlargement of the lymph nodes, tonsils, spleen, and liver. After the primary infection, EBV remains latent in B cells and oral epithelial cells; its reactivation may lead to uncontrolled monoclonal lymphoproliferation. The shedding of active EBV virus takes place intermittently thereafter from the asymptomatic host. Other pathogens causing similar syndromes include cytomegalovirus (CMV), accounting for 7% of cases, as well as human herpesvirus 6 (HHV 6), human herpesvirus 7 (HHV 7), HIV, and Toxoplasma gondii. Reservoir and transmission: Humans are the only reservoir for EBV. The pathogen is ubiquitous worldwide; almost all adults become seropositive at some point. EBV is spread via direct contact, usually through saliva; transmission is also possible by blood transfusion, bone marrow, and solid organ transplant. Incubation period: The incubation period for EBV infection is 30 to 50 days.",

        "content": "Differential diagnosis About 10% of people who present a clinical picture of infectious mononucleosis do not have an acute Epstein\u2013Barr-virus infection. A differential diagnosis of acute infectious mononucleosis needs to take into consideration acute cytomegalovirus infection and Toxoplasma gondii infections. Because their management is much the same, it is not always helpful, or possible, to distinguish between Epstein\u2013Barr-virus mononucleosis and cytomegalovirus infection. However, in pregnant women, differentiation of mononucleosis from toxoplasmosis is important, since it is associated with significant consequences for the fetus. Acute HIV infection can mimic signs similar to those of infectious mononucleosis, and tests should be performed for pregnant women for the same reason as toxoplasmosis.",

        "content": "Differential Diagnosis Whereas ~90% of cases of IM are due to EBV, 5\u201310% of cases are due to cytomegalovirus (CMV) (Chap. 219). CMV is the most common cause of heterophile-negative mononucleosis; less common causes of IM and differences from IM due to EBV are shown in Table 218-2. Therapy for IM consists of supportive measures, with rest and analgesia. Excessive physical activity during the first month should be avoided to reduce the possibility of splenic rupture, which often necessitates splenectomy. Glucocorticoid therapy is not indicated for uncomplicated IM and in fact may predispose to bacterial superinfection. Prednisone (40\u201360 mg/d for 2\u20133 days, with subsequent tapering of the dose over 1\u20132 weeks) has been used for the prevention of airway obstruction in patients with severe tonsillar hypertrophy, for Epstein-Barr Virus Infections, Including Infectious Mononucleosis Time of symptoms",
