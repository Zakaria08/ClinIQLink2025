        "content": "Scrub typhus is transmitted by some species of trombiculid mites (\"chiggers\", particularly Leptotrombidium deliense), which are found in areas of heavy scrub vegetation. The mites feed on infected rodent hosts and subsequently transmit the parasite to other rodents and humans. The bite of this mite leaves a characteristic black eschar that is useful to the doctor for making the diagnosis. Scrub typhus is endemic to a part of the world known as the tsutsugamushi triangle (after O. tsutsugamushi). This extends from northern Japan and far-eastern Russia in the north, to the territories around the Solomon Sea into northern Australia in the south, and to Pakistan and Afghanistan in the west. It may also be endemic in parts of South America. The precise incidence of the disease is unknown, as diagnostic facilities are not available in much of its large native range, which spans vast regions of equatorial jungle to the subtropics. In rural Thailand and Laos, murine and scrub typhus account for around a quarter of all adults presenting to hospital with fever and negative blood cultures. The incidence in Japan has fallen over the past few decades, probably due to land development driving decreasing exposure, and many prefectures report fewer than 50 cases per year. It affects females more than males in Korea, but not in Japan, which may be because sex-differentiated cultural roles have women tending garden plots more often, thus being exposed to vegetation inhabited by chiggers. The incidence is increasing in the southern part of the Indian subcontinent and in northern areas around Darjeeling.",

        "content": "The following are the major rickettsial diseases: 1. Epidemic typhus, small pockets of which are present in many developing parts of the world. It is transmitted from lice to humans and from person to person. 2. Murine (endemic) typhus, which is present in the same areas as Rocky Mountain spotted fever (see in the following text). It is transmitted by fleas from rats to humans. 3. Scrub typhus or tsutsugamushi fever, which is confined to eastern and southeastern Asia. It is transmitted by mites from infected rodents or humans. 4. Rocky Mountain spotted fever, first described in Montana, is most common in Long Island, Tennessee, Virginia, North Carolina, and Maryland and in the Southwest. It is transmitted by special varieties of ticks.",
