        "content": "Vascular patterns 10.2.1. Classic patterns The classic vascular patterns associated with dysplasia are mosaicism, punctation, and atypical vessels. The degree of coarseness of these patterns relates to the likelihood of there being high grade intraepithelial disease, i.e. the finer the pattern, the less likely, and the coarser the pattern, the more likely. With the green (or blue) filter before the application of acetic acid and with a high power magnification view, even subtle vessel changes may be identified. The afferent and efferent capillaries within the villi (Fig. 8.4) of columnar epithelium become compressed during the normal metaplastic process and are not incorporated within the newly formed squamous epithelium. Instead, they form a fine network below the basement membrane. When CIN develops as a result of HPV infection and atypical metaplasia, the afferent and efferent capillary system may be trapped (incorporated) into the diseased dysplastic epithelium through several elongated stromal papillae (Figs. 10.3a and 10.4a), and a thin layer of epithelium may remain on top of these vessels. This forms the basis of the punctate and mosaic blood vessel patterns (Figs. 10.3 and 10.4). The terminating vessels in the stromal papillae underlying the thin epithelium may appear as black points in a stippling pattern in an end on view under the colposcope, making what are called punctate areas (Fig. 10.4b and d). The interconnecting blood vessels in the stromal papillae surrounding the rete pegs of the epithelium, running parallel to the surface, may be observed colposcopically as cobbled areas similar to a mosaic pattern (Fig. 10.3). In mosaic areas, the epithelium appears as individual blocks: small or large, round or polygonal, and regular or irregular. Punctation and mosaic areas may be classified as either fine or coarse. Coarse vascular changes tend to be associated with more severe degrees of abnormality (CIN2 or greater including microinvasion). When both punctation and mosaic patterns are found to coexist, the same evaluation criteria for colposcopic prediction of disease are used as when they exist separately. Vessels exhibiting punctation and mosaics are usually more strikingly obvious than the normal stromal vessels because these vessels penetrate into the epithelium and are thus closer to the surface. When acetic acid is applied, these abnormal vascular patterns are usually confined to the acetowhite areas. \u201cFine punctation\u201d refers to looped capillaries \u2013 viewed end on \u2013 that appear to be of fine calibre and located close to one another, producing a delicate stippling effect (Fig. 10.4b). Fine mosaics are a network of fine calibre blood vessels that appear in close proximity to one another, as a mosaic pattern, when viewed with the colposcope. These two vascular appearances may occur together and may be found in low grade (CIN1) lesions. The patterns do not necessarily appear throughout the whole lesion. Coarse punctation (Fig. 10.4d) and coarse mosaics (Fig. 10.3b\u2013d, g, and h) are formed by vessels of larger calibre and with larger intercapillary distances, in contrast to the corresponding fine changes. Coarse punctation and mosaicism tend to occur in more severe neoplastic lesions, such as CIN2 and CIN3 lesions and early preclinical invasive cancer. Sometimes, the two patterns are superimposed in an area so that the capillary loops occur in the centre of each mosaic \u201ctile\u201d. This appearance is called umbilication (Fig. 10.3e). Coarse mosaicism or coarse punctation scores 2 in the Swede score. 10.2.2. Atypical patterns Abnormal vessel patterns that do not appear mosaic or punctate include corkscrew vessels, comma like vessels, and character writing type vessels. These are associated with high grade lesions or microinvasive and invasive disease. Character writing type vessels are particularly associated with adenocarcinoma in situ or invasive adenocarcinoma.",
