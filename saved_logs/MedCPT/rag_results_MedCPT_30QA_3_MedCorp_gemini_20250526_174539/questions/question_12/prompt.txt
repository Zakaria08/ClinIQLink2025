Document 1 (Title: Rectal myectomy in Hirschsprung disease: a decade of experience.): Short-segment aganglionosis is becoming more frequently recognized in view of more sophisticated diagnostic techniques, as well as the greater clinical awareness of the entity. A series of 37 patients who underwent rectal myectomy during a ten-year period was reviewed. Selected patients with short-segment aganglionosis, proved by muscle biopsy, responded well to a single transanal operation that required an overnight hospital stay. The complications were minimal, and the cure or marked improvement has persisted for as long as 11 years. When major surgery of an abdominoperineal pull-through type was required after the myectomy (four patients), no technical difficulties were encountered. Within the limits of its applicability, rectal myectomy has a definite place in the treatment of short-segment Hirschsprung disease.
Document 2 (Title: Hirschsprung Disease -- Treatment / Management): The recommended timing for a definite pull-through procedure varies from four to six months following colostomy placement. A variety of pull-through surgeries have been identified. The traditional Swenson's technique involves proctectomy, pulling the healthy ganglionated colon through, and anastomosing it to the anus. Novel surgical procedures (e.g., Duhamel's and Soave's procedures) have the advantage of preserving the intricate innervation of the rectum and bladder. [34] The early postoperative period following Soave's procedure is critical. Frequent regular sessions of mechanical anastomotic dilations, which might be done at home, are highly recommended. All of these procedures have high success rates, and morbidity is minimal. [35]
Document 3 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): in the pulled-through segment leading to ganglion cell loss. Long-term results with the three procedures are comparable and generally excellent in experienced hands. These three procedures also can be adapted for total colonic aganglionosis in which the ileum is used for the pull-through segment.Anorectal MalformationsAnatomic Description. Anorectal malformations describe a spectrum of congenital anomalies that include imperforate anus and persistent cloaca. Anorectal malformations occur in approximately 1 in 5000 live births and affect males and females almost equally. The embryologic basis includes failure of descent of the urorectal septum. The level to which this septum descends determines the type of anomaly that is present, which subsequently influences the surgical approach.In patients with imperforate anus, the rectum fails to descend through the external sphincter complex. Instead, the rectal pouch ends “blindly” in the pelvis, above or below the levator ani muscle. In most
