        "title": "NADPH-dependent beta-oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids with double bonds extending from odd-numbered carbon atoms.",
        "content": "The mitochondrial metabolism of 5-enoyl-CoAs, which are formed during the beta-oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids with double bonds extending from odd-numbered carbon atoms, was studied with mitochondrial extracts and purified enzymes of beta-oxidation. Metabolites were identified spectrophotometrically and by high performance liquid chromatography. 5-cis-Octenoyl-CoA, a putative metabolite of linolenic acid, was efficiently dehydrogenated by medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (EC 1.3.99.3) to 2-trans-5-cis-octadienoyl-CoA, which was isomerized to 3,5-octadienoyl-CoA either by mitochondrial delta 3,delta 2-enoyl-CoA isomerase (EC 5.3.3.8) or by peroxisomal trifunctional enzyme. Further isomerization of 3,5-octadienoyl-CoA to 2-trans-4-trans-octadienoyl-CoA in the presence of soluble extracts of either rat liver or rat heart mitochondria was observed and attributed to a delta 3,5,delta 2,4-dienoyl-CoA isomerase. Qualitatively similar results were obtained with 2-trans-5-trans-octadienoyl-CoA formed by dehydrogenation of 5-trans-octenoyl-CoA. 2-trans-4-trans-Octadienoyl-CoA was a substrate for NADPH-dependent 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase (EC 1.3.1.34). A soluble extract of rat liver mitochondria catalyzed the isomerization of 2-trans-5-cis-octadienoyl-CoA to 2-trans-4-trans-octadienoyl-CoA, which upon addition of NADPH, NAD+, and CoA was chain-shortened to hexanoyl-CoA, butyryl-CoA, and acetyl-CoA. Thus we conclude that odd-numbered double bonds, like even-numbered double bonds, can be reductively removed during the beta-oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids.",

        "title": "Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase",
        "content": "Acyl-CoA dehydrogenases (ACADs) are a class of enzymes that function to catalyze the initial step in each cycle of fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation in the mitochondria of cells. Their action results in the introduction of a trans double-bond between C2 (\u03b1) and C3 (\u03b2) of the acyl-CoA thioester substrate. Flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) is a required co-factor in addition to the presence of an active site glutamate in order for the enzyme to function. The following reaction is the oxidation of the fatty acid by FAD to afford an \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated fatty acid thioester of Coenzyme A: ACADs can be categorized into three distinct groups based on their specificity for short-, medium-, or long-chain fatty acid acyl-CoA substrates. While different dehydrogenases target fatty acids of varying chain length, all types of ACADs are mechanistically similar. Differences in the enzyme occur based on the location of the active site along the amino acid sequence.",

Consequently, additional enzymes are required.

Oxidation of a double bond at an even-numbered carbon, such as 18:2(9,12) (linoleic acid), requires an NADPH-dependent 2,4-dienoyl CoA reductase in addition to the isomerase.
