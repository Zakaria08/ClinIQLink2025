Document 1 (Title: Sleep disorder): Major depressive disorder (MDD) Sleep disturbances (insomnia or hypersomnia) are not a necessary diagnostic criterion—but one of the most frequent symptoms of individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD). Among individuals with MDD, insomnia and hypersomnia have prevalence rates of 88% and 27%, respectively, whereas individuals with insomnia have a threefold increased risk of developing MDD. Depressed mood and sleep efficiency strongly co-vary, and while sleep regulation problems may precede depressive episodes, such depressive episodes may also precipitate sleep deprivation. Fatigue, as well as sleep disturbances such as irregular and excessive sleepiness, are linked to symptoms of depression. Recent research has even pointed to sleep problems and fatigues as potential driving forces bridging MDD symptoms to those of co-occurring generalized anxiety disorder. Treatment
Document 2 (Title: Neurology_Adams): Physicians are frequently consulted by patients who suffer from some derangement of sleep. Most often, the problem is one of sleeplessness, but sometimes it concerns excessive sleepiness or some peculiar phenomenon occurring in connection with sleep. Certain points concerning normal sleep and the sleep–wake mechanisms are worth reviewing, as familiarity with them is necessary for an understanding of disorders of sleep. A great deal of information about sleep and sleep abnormalities is now available as a result of the development of the subspecialty of sleep medicine and the existence of centers for the diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders. Most disorders of sleep can be readily recognized if one attends closely to the patient’s description of the disturbance. Cases requiring the documentation of apneic episodes or those with more complex disorders such as seizures and other motor symptoms during sleep, benefit from attention in sleep laboratories.
Document 3 (Title: Sleep and Neurodegenerative Disorders -- Epidemiology): The coexistence of SDB and Parkinson disease has been reported in the literature in variable frequency (prevalence between 27% and 73%). [31] [32] Even though several studies have indicated that many patients with Parkinson disease experience SDB, the reported prevalence varies due to various factors, such as different definitions of respiratory events, severity thresholds of the disease, or diagnostic methods employed. [33] [34] This variability in reported prevalence is explained by heterogeneity in sample size, disease severity, and diagnostic definition and testing modality. For example, using standard diagnostic polysomnography (PSG) in a retrospective series of 49 patients with Parkinson disease, at least 21 patients (43%) had OSA diagnosed (apnea/hypopnea index [AHI] ≥5 events/hour). [35]
