        "content": "Forty-three otherwise healthy patients mostly between the ages of 10 and 40 were seen in North India during a two-year period with urticaria which developed on taking a cold water bath, exposure to cold winds, evaporation of rain water or sweat in that order of frequency. There was no familial predisposition to cold urticaria or atopic disorders. The refrigeration test for cryo-proteins was negative. Only one patient developed a wheal on contact with ice but 38 of 43 patients showed an exaggerated erythema response to a cold-pressure test (cryo-stimulation test).",
