Document 1 (Title: Surgical Options in the Treatment of Severe Obesity -- Issues of Concern -- Bariatric Procedures for Management of Severe Obesity): The weight loss mechanism typically falls into 1 of 2 categories, but some procedures have both components. These mechanisms include malabsorption and restriction. Neurohormonal effects contribute to the regulation of energy balance and hunger control. Key hormones include leptin and ghrelin. Examples of restrictive procedures include vertical banded gastroplasty, laparoscopic adjustable gastric band, and sleeve gastrectomy. Malabsorptive procedures include jejunoileal bypass, biliopancreatic diversion (BPD), or biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch. A combination procedure commonly performed is the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. [6]
Document 2 (Title: Duodenal switch: a new form of pancreaticobiliary diversion.): The duodenal switch operation is a new form of pancreaticobiliary diversion with superior physiologic consequences compared with the Roux-en-Y procedure. The new technique has been extensively tested in the laboratory and found to be nonulcerogenic and to be less disruptive of foregut physiology than the Roux-en-Y procedure. The duodenal switch has been used in more than 40 patients with confirmed duodenogastric reflux and has proved to be well tolerated and successful in long-term follow-up.
