        "content": "The weight loss mechanism typically falls into\u00a01 of\u00a02 categories, but some procedures have both components.\u00a0These mechanisms include malabsorption and restriction. Neurohormonal effects contribute to the regulation of energy balance and hunger control. Key hormones include leptin and ghrelin. Examples of restrictive procedures include vertical banded gastroplasty, laparoscopic adjustable gastric band, and sleeve gastrectomy. Malabsorptive procedures include jejunoileal bypass, biliopancreatic diversion (BPD), or biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch. A combination procedure commonly performed is the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. [6]",

        "content": "The duodenal switch operation is a new form of pancreaticobiliary diversion with superior physiologic consequences compared with the Roux-en-Y procedure. The new technique has been extensively tested in the laboratory and found to be nonulcerogenic and to be less disruptive of foregut physiology than the Roux-en-Y procedure. The duodenal switch has been used in more than 40 patients with confirmed duodenogastric reflux and has proved to be well tolerated and successful in long-term follow-up.",
