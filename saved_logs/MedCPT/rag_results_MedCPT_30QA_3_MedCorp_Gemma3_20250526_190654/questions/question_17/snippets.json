        "content": "Prostate cancer staging is the process by which physicians categorize the risk of cancer having spread beyond the prostate, or equivalently, the probability of being cured with local therapies such as surgery or radiation. Once patients are placed in prognostic categories, this information can contribute to the selection of an optimal approach to treatment. Prostate cancer stage can be assessed by either clinical or pathological staging methods. Clinical staging usually occurs before the first treatment and tumour presence is determined through imaging and rectal examination, while pathological staging is done after treatment once a biopsy is performed or the prostate is removed by looking at the cell types within the sample.",

        "content": "Discovery of a localized prostatic cancer frequently creates a therapeutic dilemma. A significant number of patients do well for an extended period of time without treatment, while others suffer rapid tumor progression and death from prostatic cancer. Without treatment nearly one third of patients with stage B prostatic cancer can be expected to develop distant metastatic disease or death from prostatic cancer within 10 years. In patients who otherwise have a reasonable life expectancy of 10 years or more, aggressive therapy is justified. Long-term disease-free survival has been reported after both radical prostatectomy and external irradiation. The fact that nearly 50% of patients treated with external irradiation for stage B prostatic cancer have positive postirradiation biopsies is of concern, but the impact of this finding on overall survival is yet to be determined. The only randomized prospective study comparing radical prostatectomy with external irradiation showed a statistically significant decrease in the time to Nevertheless, as evidenced by the National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Panel, further randomized prospective trials are needed to determine the relative value of radical prostatectomy versus external irradiation for localized prostatic cancer. For the forseeable future, definitive scientific data on which to base treatment recommendations will not be available. Therefore, patients should be well informed of the various treatment options available, and the wishes of the patient are paramount. The clinician's roles are to interpret the data, present it in a meaningful manner to patients, be guided in discussions by patient preferences, and make recommendations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "content": "Recent evidence has demonstrated survival benefits from radiotherapy plus ADT in men who would have been traditionally assigned to watchful waiting when they progress to locally advanced disease. This calls into question the distinction between active surveillance and watchful waiting. For instance, although the risk-benefit analysis at initial presentation with the localized disease might be considered unfavorable in an asymptomatic man with co-morbidities, progression to a more advanced stage (eg, T3 disease from T2) could trigger a more radical approach. This is in line with deferred curative treatment. As such, the key to successful monitoring of localized prostate cancer rests on thorough clinical evaluation and an honest appraisal, with the patient, of goals and priorities. [39]",
