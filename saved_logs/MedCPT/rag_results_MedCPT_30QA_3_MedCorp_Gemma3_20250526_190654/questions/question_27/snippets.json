        "title": "[Optic nerve hemangioblastoma. Case report].",
        "content": "A solitary hemangioblastoma of the optic nerve was found in a 36-year-old male with a distinct family history of intracranial hemangioblastoma. The patient was admitted with complaints of visual loss and exophthalmos of the right eye. X-rays showed enlargement of the right optic canal. Right carotid angiography revealed a hypervascular tumor in the orbital apex, supplied by the ophthalmic artery. Computed tomography disclosed a pear-shaped, isodense mass with moderate contrast enhancement in the orbital apex. The right optic nerve was enlarged along its entire course and was involved with the apical mass. Surgery via the right frontal extradural approach disclosed a solid, vascular tumor involving the optic nerve at the apex of the orbit. Histological examination showed the tumor to be a characteristic hemangioblastoma. Over 90% of intracranial hemangioblastomas are located in the posterior fossa. Supratentorial hemangioblastomas, especially those arising in the optic nerve, are extremely rare. In addition, optic nerve hemangioblastomas are frequently familial and are associated with infratentorial hemangioblastomas, angiomatosis retinae, and cysts of the abdominal viscera.",

        "title": "Hyperbaric Treatment of Central Retinal Artery Occlusion -- Etiology",
        "content": "Arterial supply to the eye is\u00a0via the\u00a0ophthalmic artery, a branch of the cavernous portion of the internal carotid artery. The central retinal artery enters the globe along with the optic nerve and serves the inner layers of the retina through its many branches. Fifteen percent to 30% of the population have a cilioretinal artery, part of the choroidal arterial supply. This supplies the area of the retina around the macula, which is the central vision area. Patients with a cilioretinal artery may still have preserved central vision because this portion of the retina is still being perfused.",

        "content": "As of 2019, membership is open to any person of good moral character, and believes in the existence of a supreme being, and is not a member of the Communist Party nor any organization which advocates the overthrow of the United States government. Currently, either gender can become a member of an Aerie, however, only women can become a member of an Auxiliary. In recent history, numerous Aerie chapters have absorbed their Auxiliaries to form one unified chapter that allows all genders, to which the Grand Aerie and Grand Auxiliary responded with enacting a law that any Auxiliary members who wish to leave the women's only chapter and join the Aerie, must be a non-member of the entire organization for one full year, which has discouraged countless members from doing so.",
