        "content": "Poliovirus, a non-enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA enterovirus, demonstrates selective neurotropism with distinctive pathophysiological mechanisms leading to acute flaccid paralysis. The pathogenic sequence begins with fecal-oral transmission followed by primary replication within oropharyngeal and intestinal mucosa. Subsequent viremia facilitates viral dissemination, with breakthrough into the central nervous system occurring in approximately 1% of infected individuals. Neuroinvasion proceeds through either hematogenous spread across the blood-brain barrier or retrograde axonal transport via peripheral nerves. The virus demonstrates exquisite tropism for lower motor neurons in the anterior horn of the spinal cord, brainstem motor nuclei, and motor cortex, utilizing the poliovirus receptor (PVR/CD155) for cellular entry. Viral replication within motor neurons induces direct cytolytic effects, leading to neuronal destruction and resultant denervation of associated muscle groups. The preferential involvement of anterior horn cells, which constitute the final common pathway for voluntary motor control, produces the characteristic presentation of asymmetric flaccid paralysis with areflexia and preserved sensory function. This pattern contrasts distinctly with demyelinating processes affecting peripheral nerves, which typically produce sensorimotor deficits with variable reflex changes, or primary myopathies affecting muscle cells themselves. Regional predilection within the spinal cord manifests as characteristic involvement of proximal muscle groups, particularly those of the lower extremities, with respiratory compromise occurring when cervical segments supplying diaphragmatic innervation become affected. Central nervous system infection typically produces a mild cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis with predominant lymphocytes, normal glucose levels, and mildly elevated protein\u2014a pattern consistent with viral meningoencephalitis. Non-motor manifestations include autonomic dysfunction and, less commonly, encephalitis with altered consciousness. Prevention through widespread vaccination has dramatically reduced global disease incidence, with both inactivated (Salk) and live-attenuated (Sabin) vaccines eliciting protective immunity through neutralizing antibody production. Neither established antiviral agents nor immunomodulatory therapies have demonstrated efficacy in limiting neuronal damage once infection is established, underscoring the critical role of preventive immunization.",

        "title": "Zoonotic Viral Encephalitides: Modes of Transmission and Clinical Manifestations",
        "content": "Rabies virus, a neurotropic rhabdovirus of the Lyssavirus genus, represents one of the most lethal infectious diseases, with near-universal fatality once clinical symptoms develop. Transmission typically occurs through percutaneous exposure to infected saliva via animal bites, though alternative routes including mucosal exposure and aerosol inhalation have been documented in specific environmental contexts. The pathophysiological sequence begins at the inoculation site, where initial viral replication occurs within muscle tissue. Subsequently, the virus enters peripheral nerves, exploiting retrograde axonal transport to access the central nervous system. This neural progression explains the variable incubation period (typically 3-12 weeks) influenced by wound location and distance from the central nervous system. Prodromal symptoms include fever, malaise, headache, and often paresthesia or pruritus at the inoculation site. As the infection progresses to the clinical stage, patients develop the pathognomonic features of encephalitic (furious) rabies: hyperexcitability, autonomic dysfunction, hydrophobia, aerophobia, and ultimately paralysis leading to respiratory failure. Hydrophobia, the characteristic fear of water, stems from painful pharyngeal muscle spasms triggered by swallowing attempts, while hypersalivation results from dysphagia combined with increased secretion. The paralytic form presents with ascending flaccid paralysis resembling Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, complicating early diagnosis. Exposure risk varies significantly by geographic region and animal reservoir. Traditional sources include canids (dogs, foxes, wolves), raccoons, and skunks, though any mammal may potentially transmit the virus. Bats represent a particularly concerning vector due to their widespread distribution, potential for inapparent exposure through minor bites, and documented transmission through inhalation of aerosolized viral particles in enclosed spaces with dense bat populations. Cave exploration (spelunking), particularly in bat-inhabited caves, represents a recognized risk factor, with multiple documented cases of presumed aerosol transmission in cavers without recognized bat bites. Preventive measures focus on post-exposure prophylaxis, including wound cleansing, rabies immune globulin, and vaccination, which remains highly effective when promptly administered following exposure.",

        "title": "Infectious Mononucleosis and Other Manifestations of Epstein Barr Virus Infection",
        "content": "Infectious mononucleosis is a syndrome characterized by fever, pharyngitis/tonsillitis, lymphadenopathy, and peripheral atypical lymphocytosis. Etiologic agents: Ninety percent of cases of typical mononucleosis are caused by the Epstein Barr virus (EBV) from the Herpesviridae family. The virus first infects oropharyngeal epithelial cells and B cells. Some of these B cells are transformed into immortal plasma cells and are triggered to produce polyclonal gamma globulins, which are detected as nonspecific heterophile antibodies. The activated B cells, which are visualized as atypical lymphocytes, stimulate proliferation of T cells, leading to the enlargement of the lymph nodes, tonsils, spleen, and liver. After the primary infection, EBV remains latent in B cells and oral epithelial cells; its reactivation may lead to uncontrolled monoclonal lymphoproliferation. The shedding of active EBV virus takes place intermittently thereafter from the asymptomatic host. Other pathogens causing similar syndromes include cytomegalovirus (CMV), accounting for 7% of cases, as well as human herpesvirus 6 (HHV 6), human herpesvirus 7 (HHV 7), HIV, and Toxoplasma gondii. Reservoir and transmission: Humans are the only reservoir for EBV. The pathogen is ubiquitous worldwide; almost all adults become seropositive at some point. EBV is spread via direct contact, usually through saliva; transmission is also possible by blood transfusion, bone marrow, and solid organ transplant. Incubation period: The incubation period for EBV infection is 30 to 50 days.",
