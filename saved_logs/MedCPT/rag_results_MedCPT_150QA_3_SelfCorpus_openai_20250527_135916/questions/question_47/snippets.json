        "content": "Abstract: 1 Blood pressure, systemic arterial compliance, and diameter, blood flow velocity, volumic flow and impedance of the brachial artery were measured before and after intravenous administration of nitroglycerin (15 micrograms/min during 15 min) in 11 patients with sustained essential hypertension. 2 For the evaluation of the diameter of the brachial artery, a bidimensional pulsed Doppler was used, enabling the angle of the ultrasound beam relative to the flowing stream of blood to be measured with an error of less than 2%. 3 After nitroglycerin, systolic pressure significantly decreased (P less than 0.01) without significant change in diastolic and mean arterial pressures, cardiac index, stroke index and total peripheral resistance. 4 Systemic arterial compliance and brachial artery diameter significantly increased (P less than 0.001; P less than 0.01) while velocity and blood flow of the brachial artery were unchanged. 5 The pattern of the input impedance of the brachial artery was consistent with a predominant effect of nitroglycerin on the viscoelastic properties of peripheral large arteries. 6 The study provided evidence that, in hypertensive patients, nitroglycerin has a direct effect on peripheral large arteries, causing an increase in arterial diameter and compliance, thus leading to a predominant decrease in systolic pressure.",

        "title": "Management Algorithm for Cervical Penetrating Injuries",
        "content": "Penetrating neck trauma represents a unique management challenge due to the complex anatomy and potential for injury to multiple vital structures, including vascular, aerodigestive, and neurological elements. Historically, mandatory surgical exploration was advocated for all penetrating neck injuries violating the platysma. Contemporary approaches, however, have evolved toward selective management algorithms based on anatomical zone, clinical presentation, and advanced imaging. The neck is conventionally divided into three anatomical zones: Zone I (clavicles to cricoid cartilage), Zone II (cricoid cartilage to mandibular angle), and Zone III (mandibular angle to skull base). Zone I and III injuries present particular challenges due to limited surgical accessibility, while Zone II injuries permit more straightforward surgical exposure. Clinical examination remains fundamental in the initial assessment, with \"hard signs\" including active hemorrhage, expanding hematoma, pulsatile bleeding, shock, pulse deficit, bruit/thrill, airway compromise, massive subcutaneous emphysema, and hematemesis/hemoptysis. The presence of hard signs typically mandates immediate surgical intervention. For hemodynamically stable patients without hard signs, management has evolved from mandatory exploration toward selective non-operative approaches guided by radiographic evaluation. Computed tomographic angiography (CTA) has emerged as the preferred initial imaging modality for penetrating neck trauma without hard signs, demonstrating excellent sensitivity and specificity for detecting vascular injuries while simultaneously evaluating aerodigestive and soft tissue structures. This non-invasive modality offers significant advantages over conventional angiography, including rapid acquisition, three-dimensional reconstruction capabilities, and simultaneous assessment of non-vascular structures. CT angiography should be performed using a dedicated trauma protocol with arterial phase imaging and multiplanar reconstructions. Indications for surgical exploration following CTA include identified vascular injury requiring repair, aerodigestive tract violation, expanding hematoma, and persistent hemorrhage. Patients with normal CTA findings typically undergo a period of observation followed by reassessment prior to discharge. This selective, imaging-guided approach has significantly reduced negative exploration rates while maintaining excellent sensitivity for clinically significant injuries.",

        "title": "Operational Models for Acute Pediatric Care Delivery",
        "content": "Short-stay or 23-hour observation units represent an innovative care delivery model positioned between traditional outpatient management and conventional inpatient admission. These specialized units provide an intermediate level of care for patients requiring extended observation, diagnostic evaluation, or brief therapeutic interventions beyond emergency department capabilities but not necessitating full hospitalization. In pediatric settings, these units have gained increasing implementation as healthcare systems seek to optimize resource utilization while maintaining quality outcomes. Structural characteristics of pediatric short-stay units vary considerably across institutions, with diverse staffing models including dedicated hospitalist coverage, rotating faculty assignments, or extension of emergency medicine responsibilities. Physical configuration similarly ranges from designated spaces within existing departments (emergency department or inpatient ward) to standalone units. Admission criteria typically include specific diagnoses amenable to brief interventions (asthma, dehydration, cellulitis), anticipated discharge within 24 hours, hemodynamic stability, and absence of intensive monitoring requirements. Operational metrics demonstrate significant efficiency advantages compared to traditional inpatient admission. Mean length of stay typically ranges from 11-15 hours, with approximately 80-85% of patients successfully discharged within the 23-hour target. Conversion rates to inpatient status average 10-15% across reported series, with respiratory conditions and younger patient age representing the strongest predictors of conversion requirement. Cost-effectiveness analyses consistently demonstrate favorable economic outcomes, with per-patient savings of 40-60% compared to traditional inpatient admission for matched conditions. Quality indicators including readmission rates (typically 1-2% within 72 hours), adverse events, and patient/family satisfaction show equivalent or superior outcomes compared to conventional admission. Particularly compelling evidence comes from comparative studies examining matched patient cohorts treated in short-stay versus standard inpatient units. These investigations demonstrate non-inferior clinical outcomes across multiple pediatric conditions while achieving significant reductions in resource utilization, particularly nursing hours and ancillary service consumption. Implementation challenges include appropriate patient selection, care transition management, and development of condition-specific protocols that accommodate the accelerated care timeline. Successful programs emphasize standardized clinical pathways, clear admission and discharge criteria, dedicated staffing models, and robust communication mechanisms between unit personnel and primary care providers.",
