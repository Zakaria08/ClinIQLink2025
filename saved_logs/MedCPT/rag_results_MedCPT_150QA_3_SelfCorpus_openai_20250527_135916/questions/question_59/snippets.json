        "title": "A short stay or 23 hour ward in a general and academic childrens hospital Are they effective",
        "content": "Objective: We evaluated the usefulness of a short stay or 23 hour ward in a pediatric unit of a large teaching hospital, Westmead Hospital, and an academic Children\u2019s hospital, The New Children\u2019s Hospital, to determine if they are a useful addition to the emergency service. Methods: This is a descriptive comparison of prospectively collected data on all children admitted to the short stay ward at Westmead Hospital (WH) during 1994 and the short stay ward at the New Children\u2019s Hospital (NCH) during 1997\u201398. These hospitals service an identical demographic area with the latter (NCH) a tertiary referral center. The following outcome measures were used: length of stay, appropriateness of stay, rate of admission to an in hospital bed, and rate of unscheduled visits within 72 hours of discharge. Adverse events were reported and patient follow up was attempted at 48 hours after discharge in all cases. Results: The short stay ward accounted for 10.3% (Westmead Hospital) and 14.7% (New Children\u2019s Hospital) of admissions, with 56% medical in nature, 30% surgical, and the remainder procedural or psychological. Admission patterns were similar, with asthma, gastroenteritis, convulsion, pneumonia, and simple surgical conditions accounting for most short stay ward admissions. The short stay ward increased hospital efficiency with an average length of stay of 17.5 hours (Westmead Hospital) compared to 20.5 hours (New Children\u2019s Hospital). The users of the short stay ward were children of young age less than 2 years, with stay greater than 23 hours reported in only 1% of all admissions to the short stay ward. The rate of patient admission to an in hospital bed was low, (4% [Westmead Hospital] compared to 6% [New Children\u2019s Hospital]), with the number of unscheduled visits within 72 hours of short stay ward discharge less than 1%. There were no adverse events reported at either short stay ward, with parental satisfaction high. The short stay ward was developed through reallocation of resources from within the hospital to the short stay ward. This resulted in estimated savings of $1/2 million (Westmead Hospital) to $2.3 million (New Children\u2019s Hospital) to the hospital, due to more efficient bed usage. Conclusion: This data demonstrates the robust nature of the short stay ward. At these two very different institutions we have shown improved bed efficient and patient care in a cost effective way. We have also reported on greater parental satisfaction and early return of the child with their family to the community.",

        "title": "Operational Models for Acute Pediatric Care Delivery",
        "content": "Short-stay or 23-hour observation units represent an innovative care delivery model positioned between traditional outpatient management and conventional inpatient admission. These specialized units provide an intermediate level of care for patients requiring extended observation, diagnostic evaluation, or brief therapeutic interventions beyond emergency department capabilities but not necessitating full hospitalization. In pediatric settings, these units have gained increasing implementation as healthcare systems seek to optimize resource utilization while maintaining quality outcomes. Structural characteristics of pediatric short-stay units vary considerably across institutions, with diverse staffing models including dedicated hospitalist coverage, rotating faculty assignments, or extension of emergency medicine responsibilities. Physical configuration similarly ranges from designated spaces within existing departments (emergency department or inpatient ward) to standalone units. Admission criteria typically include specific diagnoses amenable to brief interventions (asthma, dehydration, cellulitis), anticipated discharge within 24 hours, hemodynamic stability, and absence of intensive monitoring requirements. Operational metrics demonstrate significant efficiency advantages compared to traditional inpatient admission. Mean length of stay typically ranges from 11-15 hours, with approximately 80-85% of patients successfully discharged within the 23-hour target. Conversion rates to inpatient status average 10-15% across reported series, with respiratory conditions and younger patient age representing the strongest predictors of conversion requirement. Cost-effectiveness analyses consistently demonstrate favorable economic outcomes, with per-patient savings of 40-60% compared to traditional inpatient admission for matched conditions. Quality indicators including readmission rates (typically 1-2% within 72 hours), adverse events, and patient/family satisfaction show equivalent or superior outcomes compared to conventional admission. Particularly compelling evidence comes from comparative studies examining matched patient cohorts treated in short-stay versus standard inpatient units. These investigations demonstrate non-inferior clinical outcomes across multiple pediatric conditions while achieving significant reductions in resource utilization, particularly nursing hours and ancillary service consumption. Implementation challenges include appropriate patient selection, care transition management, and development of condition-specific protocols that accommodate the accelerated care timeline. Successful programs emphasize standardized clinical pathways, clear admission and discharge criteria, dedicated staffing models, and robust communication mechanisms between unit personnel and primary care providers.",

        "title": "Growth promoting effects of IGF-1",
        "content": "The first demonstration that exogenous IGF-1 stimulates growth was the administration of purified hormone to hypophysectomised rats. After the biosynthesis of IGF-1 identical to the native hormone, trials of its use in humans were begun; first in adults and then in children. Our group was the first to introduce long term administration of biosynthetic IGF-1 to children with primary IGF-1 deficiency\u2014primary GH insensitivity or LS. The finding that daily IGF-1 administration raises serum alkaline phosphatase, which is an indicator of osteoblastic activity, and serum procollagen, in addition to IGFBP-3, led to long term treatment. Treatment of patients with LS was also initiated in other parts of the world. The difference between us and the other groups was that we used a once daily dose, whereas the others administered IGF-1 twice daily. Table 1 compares the linear growth response of children with LS treated by four different groups. It can be seen that before treatment the mean growth velocity was 3\u20134.7 cm/year and that this increased after IGF-1 treatment to 8.2\u20139.1 cm/year, followed by a lower velocity of 5.5\u20136.4 cm/year in the next two years. (In GH treatment the highest growth velocity registered is also in the first year of treatment.) Figure 5 illustrates the growth response to IGF-1 in eight children during the first years of treatment. Ranke and colleagues reported that two of their patients had reached the third centile (Tanner), as did the patient of Krzisnik and Battelino; however, most patients did not reach a normal final height. The reasons may be late initiation of treatment, irregular IGF-1 administration, underdosage, etc. Ranke et al conclude that long term treatment of patients with LS promoted growth and, if treatment is started at an early age, there is a considerable potential for achieving height normalisation. Because no patient in our group was treated since early infancy to final height we cannot confirm this opinion. When the growth response to GH treatment in infants with IGHD was compared with that of IGF-1 in infants with LS we found that the infants with IGHD responded faster and better than those with LS. However, the small number of patients and the differences in growth retardation between the two groups makes it difficult to reach a conclusion. Both hormones stimulated linear growth, but GH seemed more effective than IGF-1. One cause may be the greater growth deficit of the infants with LS than those with IGHD, an insufficient dose of IGF-1, or that there is a need for some GH to provide an adequate stem cell population of prechondrocytes to enable full expression of the growth promoting action of IGF-1, as postulated by Green and colleagues and Ohlson et al. All the above findings based on a few clinical studies with small groups of patients and a few experimental studies remain at present controversial. The crucial question is whether there are any, and if so, whether there are sufficient IGF-1 receptors in the \u201cprogenitor cartilage zone\u201d of the epiphyseal cartilage to respond to endocrine and exogenous IGF-1. Using the mandibular condyle of 2 day old ICR mice, Maor et al showed that these condyles, which resemble the epiphyseal plates of the long bones, contain IGF-1 and high affinity IGF-1 receptors also in the chondroprogenitor cell layers, which enables them to respond to IGF-1 in vitro. Sims et al, using mice with GH receptor KO, showed that IGF-1 administration stimulates the growth (width) of the tibial growth plate and that IGF-1 has a GH independent effect on the growth plate. These findings are similar to those found when treating hypophysectomised rats with IGF-1. In conclusion, IGF-1 is an important growth hormone, mediating the anabolic and linear growth promoting effect of pituitary GH protein. It has a GH independent growth stimulating effect, which with respect to cartilage cells is possibly optimised by the synergistic action with GH.",
