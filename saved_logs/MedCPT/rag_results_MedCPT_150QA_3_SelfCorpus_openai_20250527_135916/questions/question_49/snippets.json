        "content": "Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) represents a severe demyelinating disease of the central nervous system caused by reactivation of the John Cunningham virus (JCV), a polyomavirus that asymptomatically infects approximately 50-80% of the general adult population. In the setting of immunocompromised states, viral reactivation leads to lytic infection of oligodendrocytes, resulting in multifocal areas of demyelination throughout the brain, particularly affecting subcortical white matter. Historically associated with advanced HIV infection, hematological malignancies, and organ transplantation, PML has gained significant attention more recently in the context of immunomodulatory therapies, particularly monoclonal antibodies targeting immune cell trafficking or function. Among these agents, natalizumab has demonstrated the strongest association with PML development. Natalizumab, an \u03b14-integrin antagonist approved for treatment of multiple sclerosis and Crohn's disease, inhibits lymphocyte adhesion to vascular endothelium, thereby preventing inflammatory cell migration across the blood-brain barrier and into intestinal mucosa. This mechanism, while effective in reducing inflammation, simultaneously impairs immunosurveillance within the central nervous system, creating conditions favorable for JCV reactivation and proliferation. Risk factors for natalizumab-associated PML include longer duration of therapy (particularly beyond 24 months), prior immunosuppressant use, and positive serostatus for JCV antibodies. Clinical manifestations reflect the distribution of demyelinating lesions, typically presenting as subacute, progressive neurological deficits including altered mental status, cognitive impairment, motor weakness, ataxia, visual disturbances, and aphasia. The diagnosis relies primarily on magnetic resonance imaging, which characteristically demonstrates hyperintense lesions on T2-weighted and FLAIR sequences in the subcortical white matter, without significant mass effect or contrast enhancement. These lesions typically demonstrate a predilection for the frontal and parieto-occipital regions, with involvement of the corpus callosum and posterior fossa structures in many cases. Definitive diagnosis requires detection of JCV DNA in cerebrospinal fluid through polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or, less commonly, brain biopsy demonstrating the characteristic histopathological triad of demyelination, abnormal oligodendrocytes with enlarged nuclei, and bizarre astrocytes. Management centers on immune reconstitution, typically achieved through discontinuation of the offending immunosuppressive agent, though this approach carries risk of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS).",

        "content": "While classic angina typically presents as substernal chest pressure exacerbated by exertion and relieved by rest or nitroglycerin, atypical presentations of myocardial ischemia occur frequently, particularly in women, diabetic patients, and elderly individuals. These variant manifestations, sometimes termed angina equivalents, include exertional dyspnea without chest discomfort, epigastric or abdominal discomfort, and jaw or arm pain without accompanying chest sensations. Upper abdominal discomfort represents a particularly challenging variant that may be misattributed to gastrointestinal etiologies, delaying appropriate cardiac evaluation. The pathophysiological basis for these atypical presentations involves complex neurological mechanisms, with cardiac nociceptive signals sharing afferent pathways with those from other visceral structures, particularly the esophagus and upper gastrointestinal tract. Patients with significant cardiovascular risk factors reporting upper abdominal discomfort that correlates with physical exertion warrant careful evaluation for potential cardiac ischemia, even in the absence of classic chest pain. Diagnostic approaches differ markedly between suspected cardiac and gastrointestinal etiologies. While endoscopic evaluation may seem intuitive for abdominal symptoms, non-invasive cardiac assessment should take precedence when the clinical presentation suggests possible angina equivalent. Exercise stress testing, with or without imaging, provides valuable diagnostic and prognostic information by detecting inducible myocardial ischemia under controlled conditions. Functional testing such as hydrogen breath testing for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth or abdominal ultrasonography for biliary disease may be appropriate in patients where cardiac etiologies have been excluded or when symptoms and risk profile suggest primary gastrointestinal pathology.",

        "content": "The pressure within the renal pelvis is normally close to zero. When this pressure increases because of obstruction or reflux, the pelvis and calyces dilate. The degree of hydronephrosis that develops depends on the duration, degree, and site of the obstruction (Figure 12\u20134). The higher the obstruction, the greater the effect on the kidney. If the renal pelvis is entirely intrarenal and the obstruction is at the ureteropelvic junction, all the pressure will be exerted on the parenchyma (Klein et al., 2010). If the renal pelvis is extrarenal, only part of the pressure produced by a ureteropelvic stenosis is exerted on the parenchyma; this is because the extrarenal pelvis is embedded in fat and dilates more readily, thus \"decompressing\" the hydronephrotic left renal pelvis. Low density mass (P) in the left renal sinus had an attenuation value similar to that of water, suggesting the correct diagnosis. Unless intravenous contrast material is used, differentiation from a peripelvic cyst may be difficult. In the earlier stages, the renal pelvic musculature undergoes compensatory hypertrophy in its effort to force urine past the obstruction. Later, however, the muscle becomes stretched and atonic and decompensated. The progression of hydronephrotic atrophy is as follows (Chevalier, 2010; Rodriguez, 2004): 1. The earliest changes in the development of hydronephrosis are seen in the calyces. The end of a normal calyx is concave because of the papilla that projects into it; with increased intrapelvic pressure, the fornices become blunt and rounded. With persistence of increased intrapelvic pressure, the papilla becomes flattened, then convex (clubbed) as a result of compression enhanced by ischemic atrophy (Figure 12\u20135). The parenchyma between the calyces is affected to a lesser extent. The changes in the renal parenchyma are due to (a) compression atrophy from increased intrapelvic pressure (more accentuated with intrarenal pelves) and (b) ischemic atrophy from hemodynamic changes, mainly manifested in arcuate vessels that run at the base of the pyramids parallel to the kidney outline and are more vulnerable to compression between the renal capsule and the centrally increasing intrapelvic pressure. 2. This spotty atrophy is caused by the nature of the blood supply of the kidney. The arterioles are end arteries; therefore, ischemia is most marked in the areas farthest from the interlobular arteries. As the back pressure increases, hydronephrosis progresses, with the cells nearest the main arteries exhibiting the greatest resistance. 3. This increased pressure is transmitted up the tubules. The tubules become dilated, and their cells atrophy from ischemia. It should be pointed out that a few instances of dilated renal pelves and calyces are not due to the presence of obstruction. Rarely, the renal cavities are congenitally capacious and thus simulate hydronephrosis. More commonly, hydronephrosis may occur in childhood owing to the back pressure associated with vesicoureteral reflux. If the valvular incompetence resolves (and this is common), some degree of the hydronephrotic changes may persist. These persisting changes may cause the physician to suspect the presence of obstruction, which may lead to unnecessary surgery. A radioisotope renogram to assess ureteral drainage function can be performed to determine whether organic obstruction is present. 4. Only in unilateral hydronephrosis are the advanced stages of hydronephrotic atrophy seen. Eventually, the kidney is completely destroyed and appears as a thin walled sac filled with clear fluid (water and electrolytes) or pus (Figure 12\u20136).",
