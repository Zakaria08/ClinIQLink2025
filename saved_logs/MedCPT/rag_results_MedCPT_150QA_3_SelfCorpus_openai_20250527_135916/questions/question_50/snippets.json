        "title": "Coagulation Defects in Young Women with Menorrhagia",
        "content": "Menorrhagia, defined as excessive menstrual bleeding lasting more than 7 days or exceeding 80 mL per cycle, affects approximately 10-30% of women of reproductive age, with a significant proportion attributable to underlying bleeding disorders. When persistent since menarche and accompanied by other mucocutaneous bleeding manifestations, inherited coagulation disorders warrant particular consideration. Von Willebrand disease (VWD), the most common inherited bleeding disorder, affects approximately 1% of the general population and accounts for up to 20% of unexplained menorrhagia cases in otherwise healthy women. VWD results from quantitative or qualitative deficiencies in von Willebrand factor (VWF), a large multimeric glycoprotein that mediates platelet adhesion to subendothelial collagen and serves as a carrier for factor VIII. This autosomal inheritance pattern leads to equal sex distribution, contrasting with the X-linked recessive inheritance of hemophilia A, which primarily affects males. Laboratory evaluation of VWD typically reveals prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) due to secondary factor VIII deficiency, while prothrombin time (PT) and platelet count remain normal. Patients typically present with mucocutaneous bleeding manifestations including easy bruising, epistaxis, gingival bleeding, and particularly menorrhagia in women. Family history often reveals similar bleeding tendencies in first-degree relatives of both sexes, contrasting with the maternal uncle pattern in hemophilia A or the prothrombotic tendencies in conditions like protein C deficiency or antiphospholipid syndrome.",

        "title": "Etiology and Pathophysiology of Spontaneous Abortion",
        "content": "First-trimester pregnancy loss, clinically defined as spontaneous abortion before 13 weeks gestation, affects approximately 10-20% of clinically recognized pregnancies, with significantly higher rates when considering pre-clinical losses. While multiple etiologies contribute to early pregnancy failure, chromosomal abnormalities represent the predominant cause, accounting for approximately 50-60% of first-trimester losses. These cytogenetic aberrations predominantly arise from errors during gametogenesis or early embryonic divisions, with advancing maternal age significantly increasing risk, particularly for aneuploidies. Autosomal trisomies constitute the most common chromosomal abnormality, with trisomy 16 appearing most frequently, followed by trisomies 22, 21, and 18. Polyploidy, particularly triploidy, represents another significant cytogenetic abnormality, often associated with partial molar pregnancies. Structural chromosomal abnormalities, including translocations and inversions, contribute less frequently to sporadic losses but become increasingly significant in recurrent pregnancy loss. The pathophysiological mechanism typically involves disrupted embryonic development due to altered gene dosage, ultimately culminating in embryonic demise and subsequent expulsion. Clinical manifestations follow a characteristic sequence, beginning with embryonic death, followed by cessation of hormone production, declining progesterone and human chorionic gonadotropin levels, destabilization of the decidual-trophoblastic interface, and finally uterine contractions with expulsion of products of conception. Alternative etiologies include maternal factors such as endocrine disorders (thyroid dysfunction, uncontrolled diabetes), uterine anatomic abnormalities (septate uterus, submucosal leiomyomas), and thrombophilic conditions (antiphospholipid syndrome, inherited thrombophilias). Immunological factors, particularly alloimmune mechanisms, remain controversial and incompletely understood. External factors such as maternal exposure to toxins, including alcohol, tobacco, and certain medications, may increase risk, albeit less significantly than chromosomal factors. Physical trauma rarely causes early pregnancy loss unless associated with direct uterine injury or significant maternal hemodynamic compromise. Comprehensive evaluation for specific etiology typically follows recurrent pregnancy loss (traditionally defined as three or more consecutive losses), though contemporary approaches often initiate investigation after two losses, particularly in women of advanced reproductive age.",

        "title": "Ethylene glycol poisoning",
        "content": "Signs and symptoms Signs of ethylene glycol poisoning depend upon the time after ingestion. Symptoms usually follow a three step progression, although poisoned individuals will not always develop each stage. Stage 1 (30 minutes to 12 hours) consists of neurological and gastrointestinal symptoms and looks similar to alcohol poisoning. Poisoned individuals may appear to be intoxicated, dizzy, lacking coordination of muscle movements, drooling, depressed, and have slurred speech, seizures, abnormal eye movements, headaches, and confusion. Irritation to the stomach may cause nausea and vomiting. Also seen are excessive thirst and urination. Over time, the body metabolizes ethylene glycol into other toxins. Stage 2 (12 to 36 hours) where signs of \u201calcohol\u201d poisoning appear to resolve, underlying severe internal damage is still occurring. An elevated heart rate, hyperventilation or increased breathing effort, and dehydration may start to develop, along with high blood pressure and metabolic acidosis. These symptoms are a result of accumulation of organic acids formed by the metabolism of ethylene glycol. Additionally low calcium concentrations in the blood, overactive muscle reflexes, muscle spasms, QT interval prolongation, and congestive heart failure may occur. If untreated, death most commonly occurs during this period. Stage 3 (24 to 72 hours) kidney failure is the result of ethylene glycol poisoning. In cats, this stage occurs 12\u201324 hours after consuming antifreeze; in dogs, at 36\u201372 hours after consuming antifreeze. During this stage, severe kidney failure is developing secondary to calcium oxalate crystals forming in the kidneys. Severe lethargy, coma, depression, vomiting, seizures, drooling, and inappetence may be seen. Other symptoms include acute tubular necrosis, red blood cells in the urine, excess proteins in the urine, lower back pain, decreased or absent production of urine, elevated blood concentration of potassium, and acute kidney failure. If kidney failure occurs it is typically reversible, although weeks or months of supportive care including hemodialysis may be required before kidney function returns.",
