        "content": "Fournier's gangrene represents a particularly aggressive form of necrotizing fasciitis involving the perineal, genital, and perianal regions that continues to carry significant mortality despite modern medical advances. Epidemiological analysis demonstrates persistently high mortality rates ranging from 20-30% in contemporary series despite aggressive multidisciplinary management. Multiple institutional reviews document the rapid progression potential, with tissue destruction advancing at rates exceeding 2-3 cm per hour during active infection phases. Microbiological assessment consistently reveals polymicrobial infections with synergistic virulence factors that accelerate tissue necrosis through enhanced enzymatic activity and toxin production. Systematic reviews of prognostic factors demonstrate that delayed diagnosis and surgical intervention correlate directly with increased mortality, with each 6-hour delay associated with a 7-9% increase in mortality risk across multiple studies. Modern intensive care capabilities, while significantly improved, have not eliminated the lethal potential of this condition when diagnosis or intervention is delayed. Immunocompromised states, including diabetes mellitus and chronic alcohol use, significantly increase both susceptibility and complication rates, with mortality approaching 40% in these high-risk groups. The condition's anatomical location facilitates rapid spread through interconnected fascial planes while often masking early clinical signs, delaying presentation and diagnosis. Validated severity scoring systems continue to document substantial mortality risk even with optimal contemporary management. These collective findings from modern clinical series demonstrate that despite significant advances in surgical techniques, antimicrobial therapy, and critical care support, Fournier's gangrene remains a condition with substantial lethal potential requiring the highest level of clinical vigilance and aggressive multidisciplinary intervention.",

        "title": "Nitroglycerin",
        "content": "Nitroglycerin is a vasodilatory drug used primarily to provide relief from anginal chest pain. Nitroglycerin has been FDA approved since 2000 and was first sold as a brand name agent. It is currently FDA approved for the acute relief of an attack or acute prophylaxis of angina pectoris secondary to coronary artery disease. Off label, non FDA approved uses include treatment for hypertensive urgency/emergency, coronary artery spasm, angina secondary to cocaine use, congestive heart failure (CHF), and chronic anal fissures. Along with hydralazine as a combination therapy, it is also indicated in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection in whom ACE inhibitors are contraindicated. Nitroglycerin is occasionally given to reduce radial spasms during coronary angiography through the radial approach. Nitroglycerin was first used in 1879 as a treatment for angina and since it has been part of management to relieve anginal chest pain.[1] Although nitroglycerin has a vasodilatory effect in both arteries and veins, the profound desired effects caused by nitroglycerin are primarily due to venodilation.[2] Venodilation causes pooling of blood within the venous system, reducing preload to the heart, which causes a decrease in cardiac work, reducing anginal symptoms secondary to demand ischemia. Arterial vasodilation will still occur and contribute to the relief of anginal symptoms.[3][4] Vasodilation of the coronary arteries will cause increased blood flow to the heart, increasing perfusion, but this effect remains minimal compared to the effects of venodilation.",

        "content": "Background: Apparent life threatening events in infants are a difficult and frequent problem in pediatric practice. The prognosis is uncertain because of risk of sudden infant death syndrome. Case reports: Eight infants aged 2 to 15 months were admitted during a period of 6 years; they suffered from similar maladies in the bath: on immersion, they became pale, hypotonic, still and unreactive; recovery took a few seconds after withdrawal from the bath and stimulation. Two diagnoses were initially considered: seizure or gastroesophageal reflux but this was doubtful. The hypothesis of an equivalent of aquagenic urticaria was then considered; as for patients with this disease, each infant's family contained members suffering from dermographism, maladies or eruption after exposure to water or sun. All six infants had dermographism. We found an increase in blood histamine levels after a trial bath in the two infants tested. The evolution of these \"aquagenic maladies\" was favourable after a few weeks without baths. After a 2\u20137 year follow up, three out of seven infants continue to suffer from troubles associated with sun or water. Conclusion: \"Aquagenic maladies\" could be a pediatric form of the aquagenic urticaria.",
