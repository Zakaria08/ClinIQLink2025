        "content": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) represents a heterogeneous group of conditions characterized by persistent respiratory symptoms and airflow limitation, with cigarette smoking constituting the predominant risk factor in developed countries. The pathophysiological hallmark involves complex interactions between prolonged exposure to noxious particles and gases with host factors including genetic susceptibility and abnormal inflammatory responses. While originally conceptualized as encompassing two distinct entities\u2014emphysema and chronic bronchitis\u2014contemporary understanding recognizes substantial overlap with varying contributions in individual patients. The fundamental mechanism underlying airflow limitation centers on progressive obstruction of expiratory airflow resulting from multiple structural and functional alterations. Small airway disease represents the primary site of obstruction, with pathological changes including goblet cell metaplasia, mucus hypersecretion, submucosal gland hypertrophy, inflammatory cell infiltration, and airway wall fibrosis. These changes physically narrow the airway lumen while functionally increasing airway resistance. Additionally, loss of alveolar attachments due to emphysematous destruction reduces elastic recoil and radial traction on small airways, promoting airway collapse during expiration. This dynamic hyperinflation, rather than changes in static compliance or functional residual capacity, primarily accounts for exertional dyspnea. Local inflammatory mediators, though present, play secondary roles to the mechanical alterations in establishing airflow obstruction. The characteristic clinical manifestations\u2014productive cough, progressive dyspnea, and wheezing\u2014directly reflect these pathophysiological processes, with morning expectoration particularly suggestive of chronic bronchitis and smoking-related small airway disease.",

        "title": "Antiviral Strategies Against Orthomyxoviruses",
        "content": "Influenza viruses, belonging to the Orthomyxoviridae family, cause substantial seasonal morbidity and mortality worldwide, with periodic pandemic potential through antigenic shift events. These enveloped, negative-sense, segmented RNA viruses demonstrate a complex replication cycle offering multiple potential targets for therapeutic intervention. The viral surface presents two major glycoproteins: hemagglutinin (HA), mediating host cell attachment and membrane fusion, and neuraminidase (NA), facilitating viral release and spread. Current antiviral strategies target distinct phases of the viral replication cycle, with neuraminidase inhibitors representing the predominant class of clinically approved agents. Viral neuraminidase functions as a sialidase, cleaving sialic acid residues from both viral and cellular glycoproteins. This enzymatic activity proves essential during the viral release phase, preventing virion aggregation and facilitating dissemination to adjacent cells. Without functional neuraminidase, newly formed virions remain tethered to the infected cell surface and to each other, substantially limiting viral spread. Neuraminidase inhibitors, including oseltamivir (oral), zanamivir (inhaled), and peramivir (intravenous), are structural analogs of sialic acid that competitively bind the enzyme's active site with high specificity and affinity. These agents demonstrate activity against both influenza A and B viruses, though effectiveness varies with viral strain and timing of administration. Clinical efficacy is maximized when treatment begins within 48 hours of symptom onset, reducing symptom duration by approximately 24-36 hours and potentially decreasing complication rates. Alternative antiviral approaches include M2 ion channel inhibitors (amantadine, rimantadine), which block viral uncoating but demonstrate limited utility due to widespread resistance and ineffectiveness against influenza B. More recently developed agents target viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, including baloxavir marboxil, which inhibits cap-dependent endonuclease activity essential for viral transcription initiation. Unlike direct-acting antivirals targeting viral proteases or host-encoded proteases essential for viral protein processing, neuraminidase inhibitors do not interfere with proteolytic events but rather disrupt the final phase of the viral replication cycle, offering a distinct mechanistic approach to influenza management.",

        "title": "Growth promoting effects of IGF-1",
        "content": "The first demonstration that exogenous IGF-1 stimulates growth was the administration of purified hormone to hypophysectomised rats. After the biosynthesis of IGF-1 identical to the native hormone, trials of its use in humans were begun; first in adults and then in children. Our group was the first to introduce long term administration of biosynthetic IGF-1 to children with primary IGF-1 deficiency\u2014primary GH insensitivity or LS. The finding that daily IGF-1 administration raises serum alkaline phosphatase, which is an indicator of osteoblastic activity, and serum procollagen, in addition to IGFBP-3, led to long term treatment. Treatment of patients with LS was also initiated in other parts of the world. The difference between us and the other groups was that we used a once daily dose, whereas the others administered IGF-1 twice daily. Table 1 compares the linear growth response of children with LS treated by four different groups. It can be seen that before treatment the mean growth velocity was 3\u20134.7 cm/year and that this increased after IGF-1 treatment to 8.2\u20139.1 cm/year, followed by a lower velocity of 5.5\u20136.4 cm/year in the next two years. (In GH treatment the highest growth velocity registered is also in the first year of treatment.) Figure 5 illustrates the growth response to IGF-1 in eight children during the first years of treatment. Ranke and colleagues reported that two of their patients had reached the third centile (Tanner), as did the patient of Krzisnik and Battelino; however, most patients did not reach a normal final height. The reasons may be late initiation of treatment, irregular IGF-1 administration, underdosage, etc. Ranke et al conclude that long term treatment of patients with LS promoted growth and, if treatment is started at an early age, there is a considerable potential for achieving height normalisation. Because no patient in our group was treated since early infancy to final height we cannot confirm this opinion. When the growth response to GH treatment in infants with IGHD was compared with that of IGF-1 in infants with LS we found that the infants with IGHD responded faster and better than those with LS. However, the small number of patients and the differences in growth retardation between the two groups makes it difficult to reach a conclusion. Both hormones stimulated linear growth, but GH seemed more effective than IGF-1. One cause may be the greater growth deficit of the infants with LS than those with IGHD, an insufficient dose of IGF-1, or that there is a need for some GH to provide an adequate stem cell population of prechondrocytes to enable full expression of the growth promoting action of IGF-1, as postulated by Green and colleagues and Ohlson et al. All the above findings based on a few clinical studies with small groups of patients and a few experimental studies remain at present controversial. The crucial question is whether there are any, and if so, whether there are sufficient IGF-1 receptors in the \u201cprogenitor cartilage zone\u201d of the epiphyseal cartilage to respond to endocrine and exogenous IGF-1. Using the mandibular condyle of 2 day old ICR mice, Maor et al showed that these condyles, which resemble the epiphyseal plates of the long bones, contain IGF-1 and high affinity IGF-1 receptors also in the chondroprogenitor cell layers, which enables them to respond to IGF-1 in vitro. Sims et al, using mice with GH receptor KO, showed that IGF-1 administration stimulates the growth (width) of the tibial growth plate and that IGF-1 has a GH independent effect on the growth plate. These findings are similar to those found when treating hypophysectomised rats with IGF-1. In conclusion, IGF-1 is an important growth hormone, mediating the anabolic and linear growth promoting effect of pituitary GH protein. It has a GH independent growth stimulating effect, which with respect to cartilage cells is possibly optimised by the synergistic action with GH.",
