        "content": "Isolated third nerve palsy presents a diagnostic challenge requiring careful clinical evaluation and targeted investigation to differentiate between benign and potentially life-threatening etiologies. The oculomotor nerve innervates the levator palpebrae superioris and four extraocular muscles (medial rectus, superior rectus, inferior rectus, and inferior oblique), while also carrying parasympathetic fibers to the pupillary sphincter. The anatomical course of the nerve from brainstem to orbit creates vulnerability to compression at multiple points, with localizing value in determining the underlying pathology. Clinically, complete third nerve palsy presents with ptosis (drooping of the upper eyelid), limited adduction, supraduction, and infraduction, with the eye typically assuming a 'down and out' position due to unopposed action of the lateral rectus and superior oblique muscles. Pupillary involvement represents a critical diagnostic feature, as the superficial location of parasympathetic fibers within the nerve renders them particularly vulnerable to compression. Thus, pupil-involving third nerve palsies raise immediate concern for compressive lesions, particularly posterior communicating artery aneurysms, which require urgent vascular imaging. Advanced age, hypertension, and diabetes increase the likelihood of microvascular ischemic etiologies, though these typically spare the pupil due to relative preservation of superficial fibers. The diagnostic algorithm should be guided by the clinical presentation and patient factors. Neuroimaging constitutes the cornerstone of evaluation, with MRI providing detailed assessment of brainstem, cavernous sinus, and orbital pathology. However, in cases with pupillary involvement or other concerning features (acute onset, pain, incomplete presentation), vascular imaging, preferably with CT angiography (CTA) or MR angiography (MRA), should be performed emergently to evaluate for aneurysmal compression requiring neurosurgical intervention. Additional investigations including temporal artery biopsy for suspected giant cell arteritis or assessment of intraocular pressure for glaucoma may be appropriate in select presentations, though these etiologies rarely present as isolated third nerve palsies.",

        "title": "Growth promoting effects of IGF-1",
        "content": "The first demonstration that exogenous IGF-1 stimulates growth was the administration of purified hormone to hypophysectomised rats. After the biosynthesis of IGF-1 identical to the native hormone, trials of its use in humans were begun; first in adults and then in children. Our group was the first to introduce long term administration of biosynthetic IGF-1 to children with primary IGF-1 deficiency\u2014primary GH insensitivity or LS. The finding that daily IGF-1 administration raises serum alkaline phosphatase, which is an indicator of osteoblastic activity, and serum procollagen, in addition to IGFBP-3, led to long term treatment. Treatment of patients with LS was also initiated in other parts of the world. The difference between us and the other groups was that we used a once daily dose, whereas the others administered IGF-1 twice daily. Table 1 compares the linear growth response of children with LS treated by four different groups. It can be seen that before treatment the mean growth velocity was 3\u20134.7 cm/year and that this increased after IGF-1 treatment to 8.2\u20139.1 cm/year, followed by a lower velocity of 5.5\u20136.4 cm/year in the next two years. (In GH treatment the highest growth velocity registered is also in the first year of treatment.) Figure 5 illustrates the growth response to IGF-1 in eight children during the first years of treatment. Ranke and colleagues reported that two of their patients had reached the third centile (Tanner), as did the patient of Krzisnik and Battelino; however, most patients did not reach a normal final height. The reasons may be late initiation of treatment, irregular IGF-1 administration, underdosage, etc. Ranke et al conclude that long term treatment of patients with LS promoted growth and, if treatment is started at an early age, there is a considerable potential for achieving height normalisation. Because no patient in our group was treated since early infancy to final height we cannot confirm this opinion. When the growth response to GH treatment in infants with IGHD was compared with that of IGF-1 in infants with LS we found that the infants with IGHD responded faster and better than those with LS. However, the small number of patients and the differences in growth retardation between the two groups makes it difficult to reach a conclusion. Both hormones stimulated linear growth, but GH seemed more effective than IGF-1. One cause may be the greater growth deficit of the infants with LS than those with IGHD, an insufficient dose of IGF-1, or that there is a need for some GH to provide an adequate stem cell population of prechondrocytes to enable full expression of the growth promoting action of IGF-1, as postulated by Green and colleagues and Ohlson et al. All the above findings based on a few clinical studies with small groups of patients and a few experimental studies remain at present controversial. The crucial question is whether there are any, and if so, whether there are sufficient IGF-1 receptors in the \u201cprogenitor cartilage zone\u201d of the epiphyseal cartilage to respond to endocrine and exogenous IGF-1. Using the mandibular condyle of 2 day old ICR mice, Maor et al showed that these condyles, which resemble the epiphyseal plates of the long bones, contain IGF-1 and high affinity IGF-1 receptors also in the chondroprogenitor cell layers, which enables them to respond to IGF-1 in vitro. Sims et al, using mice with GH receptor KO, showed that IGF-1 administration stimulates the growth (width) of the tibial growth plate and that IGF-1 has a GH independent effect on the growth plate. These findings are similar to those found when treating hypophysectomised rats with IGF-1. In conclusion, IGF-1 is an important growth hormone, mediating the anabolic and linear growth promoting effect of pituitary GH protein. It has a GH independent growth stimulating effect, which with respect to cartilage cells is possibly optimised by the synergistic action with GH.",

        "title": "Psychophysical Assessment of Visual Function in Amblyopia",
        "content": "Visual acuity assessment constitutes a fundamental component of ophthalmological evaluation, with multiple testing modalities developed to quantify resolution capabilities across diverse patient populations. Among these, optotype-based tests\u2014including Snellen charts and Landolt C configurations\u2014represent standard clinical approaches for assessing spatial resolution. While frequently considered equivalent in normal vision, these tests may yield divergent results under specific pathological conditions, prompting investigation into their comparative utility. The Snellen E optotype consists of the letter E presented in four possible orientations, requiring the subject to identify the direction of the three horizontal strokes. In contrast, the Landolt C (or Landolt ring) presents a circle with a small gap, with the subject tasked with identifying the gap's position. Both tests theoretically measure minimum resolvable acuity, with letter height standardized at five times the stroke width, conforming to the five-minute-of-arc standard. Despite these theoretical similarities, research comparing acuity measurements between these optotypes in strabismic amblyopia has yielded inconsistent findings. Some studies suggest comparable results between the two tests in amblyopic patients, reporting high correlation coefficients and minimal systematic differences. These investigations conclude that the tests can be used interchangeably, with test selection guided by patient characteristics rather than expected performance variations. Contradicting these findings, other research has documented systematic differences, with amblyopic patients demonstrating relatively poorer performance on Landolt C tests compared to Snellen E assessments. Proposed mechanisms for this discrepancy include differential crowding effects, with the Landolt C gap potentially more susceptible to lateral inhibition, and differences in recognition difficulty based on neural processing requirements. The clinical significance of these discrepancies remains contentious, as observed differences rarely exceed one line on standard acuity charts, falling within the range of test-retest variability in amblyopic vision assessment. Methodological variations across studies further complicate interpretation, with differences in optotype presentation, testing distance, and subject characteristics potentially contributing to divergent conclusions regarding equivalence. Current evidence suggests that while small systematic differences may exist between Landolt C and Snellen E acuity measurements in strabismic amblyopia, these differences likely lack clinical significance for routine assessment and therapeutic monitoring.",
