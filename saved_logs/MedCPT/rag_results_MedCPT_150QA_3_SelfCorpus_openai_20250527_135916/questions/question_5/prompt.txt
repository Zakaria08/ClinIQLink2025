Document 1 (Title: Coagulation Defects in Young Women with Menorrhagia): Menorrhagia, defined as excessive menstrual bleeding lasting more than 7 days or exceeding 80 mL per cycle, affects approximately 10-30% of women of reproductive age, with a significant proportion attributable to underlying bleeding disorders. When persistent since menarche and accompanied by other mucocutaneous bleeding manifestations, inherited coagulation disorders warrant particular consideration. Von Willebrand disease (VWD), the most common inherited bleeding disorder, affects approximately 1% of the general population and accounts for up to 20% of unexplained menorrhagia cases in otherwise healthy women. VWD results from quantitative or qualitative deficiencies in von Willebrand factor (VWF), a large multimeric glycoprotein that mediates platelet adhesion to subendothelial collagen and serves as a carrier for factor VIII. This autosomal inheritance pattern leads to equal sex distribution, contrasting with the X-linked recessive inheritance of hemophilia A, which primarily affects males. Laboratory evaluation of VWD typically reveals prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) due to secondary factor VIII deficiency, while prothrombin time (PT) and platelet count remain normal. Patients typically present with mucocutaneous bleeding manifestations including easy bruising, epistaxis, gingival bleeding, and particularly menorrhagia in women. Family history often reveals similar bleeding tendencies in first-degree relatives of both sexes, contrasting with the maternal uncle pattern in hemophilia A or the prothrombotic tendencies in conditions like protein C deficiency or antiphospholipid syndrome.
Document 2 (Title: Clinical Manifestations of Thyroid Hormone Deficiency): Hypothyroidism represents a common endocrine disorder with diverse manifestations reflecting thyroid hormone's fundamental role in multiple physiological processes. Laboratory evaluation reveals characteristic patterns, with reduced serum free T4 levels representing a diagnostic hallmark across various hypothyroid etiologies. The condition produces distinctive metabolic effects including significant thermoregulatory changes, with affected individuals demonstrating reduced basal metabolic rate and heat production resulting in cold intolerance and documented hypothermia in more severe cases. Energy metabolism alterations manifest clinically as progressive fatigue and characteristic weight changes despite unchanged or reduced caloric intake, with most patients experiencing 10-20 pound weight increases during disease development. Cardiovascular manifestations include bradycardia, mild hypertension, and occasionally pericardial effusions in advanced cases. Neuropsychiatric symptoms predominate in many presentations, featuring cognitive slowing, memory impairment, and depressive symptoms rather than anxiety or nervousness, which more typically characterize hyperthyroid states. Gastrointestinal motility reduction commonly produces constipation, while dermatological changes include characteristic skin dryness, hair thinning, and non-pitting edema from glycosaminoglycan accumulation. Particularly significant laboratory findings beyond thyroid function tests include dyslipidemia, with elevated total cholesterol, LDL-C, and triglycerides resulting from reduced hepatic LDL receptor expression and diminished cholesterol clearance. This consistent hypercholesterolemia represents an important metabolic consequence requiring monitoring during treatment. Comprehensive management requires addressing both the underlying thyroid dysfunction and associated metabolic derangements through appropriate hormone replacement therapy and monitoring of clinical and biochemical parameters during treatment.
Document 3 (Title: Genetic Basis and Clinical Management of Coagulopathies): Hemophilia represents a group of hereditary coagulation disorders with distinctive genetic, laboratory, and clinical characteristics determining diagnosis, management approaches, and potential complications. Genetic analysis reveals predominantly X-linked inheritance patterns, with affected males inheriting maternal mutations while females typically serve as asymptomatic carriers due to X-chromosome inactivation patterns. This sex-linked transmission creates characteristic family distribution patterns distinct from autosomal inheritance disorders. Clinical presentation typically develops gradually rather than appearing immediately at birth, with diagnosis often occurring after progressive recognition of excessive bruising, joint bleeding, or prolonged bleeding following minor trauma or surgical procedures during early childhood. Laboratory evaluation reveals specific factor deficiencies, with hemophilia A demonstrating factor VIII deficiency while hemophilia B (Christmas disease) results from factor IX deficiency rather than alterations in factor X levels. Contemporary management approaches employ factor replacement therapy using either plasma-derived or recombinant clotting factor concentrates, though approximately 20-30% of severely affected individuals develop neutralizing alloantibodies (inhibitors) following repeated exposure to replacement therapy. These inhibitors represent a major treatment complication necessitating alternative hemostatic approaches including bypassing agents or immune tolerance induction protocols. Advances in molecular diagnostics have enabled expanded genetic screening capabilities, allowing carrier detection and prenatal diagnosis through chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis when desired by affected families. These diagnostic capabilities facilitate informed reproductive decision-making and early intervention planning for affected pregnancies. Ongoing research explores gene therapy approaches potentially offering definitive treatment through targeted genetic modification of hepatocytes to enable endogenous clotting factor production.

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
Question: A 20-year-old woman presents with menorrhagia for the past several years. She says that her menses “have always been heavy”, and she has experienced easy bruising for as long as she can remember. Family history is significant for her mother, who had similar problems with bruising easily. The patient's vital signs include: heart rate 98/min, respiratory rate 14/min, temperature 36.1°C (96.9°F), and blood pressure 110/87 mm Hg. Physical examination is unremarkable. Laboratory tests show the following: platelet count 200,000/mm3, PT 12 seconds, and PTT 43 seconds. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient’s symptoms?
Options:
A. Hemophilia A
B. Lupus anticoagulant
C. Protein C deficiency
D. Von Willebrand disease
