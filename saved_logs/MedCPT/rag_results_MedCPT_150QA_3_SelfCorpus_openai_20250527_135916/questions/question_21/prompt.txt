With your own knowledge and the help of the following document:

Document 1 (Title: Neurological Emergencies in Oncology): Spinal cord compression syndromes represent potentially devastating neurological emergencies requiring prompt recognition and intervention to prevent permanent neurological deficits. Among these, cauda equina syndrome (CES) deserves particular attention due to its distinct anatomical and clinical considerations. Unlike compression at higher spinal levels, CES involves compression of the lumbar and sacral nerve roots below the conus medullaris (L1-L2 level), which constitute the cauda equina. Metastatic disease, particularly from primary tumors with predilection for skeletal spread such as prostate, breast, and lung carcinomas, represents a common etiology in the oncological population. The clinical presentation of CES is characterized by a constellation of symptoms and signs including low back pain (present in >90% of cases), bilateral lower extremity weakness or sensory deficits (often asymmetric), saddle anesthesia (reduced sensation in perineal, perianal, and genital regions), and bowel or bladder dysfunction. Notably, saddle anesthesia represents a highly sensitive finding that may precede overt bladder or bowel dysfunction. Reflex abnormalities, particularly hyporeflexia of lower extremity deep tendon reflexes, reflect interruption of reflex arcs due to compression of cauda equina nerve roots. Management constitutes a true neurological emergency with initiation of high-dose intravenous corticosteroids (typically dexamethasone) representing the critical first intervention to reduce edema and inflammation surrounding the compressed neural elements. This should be administered immediately upon clinical suspicion, even before confirmatory imaging, as the time to treatment directly correlates with neurological outcomes. MRI represents the gold standard imaging modality, offering superior visualization of neural elements and the compressive pathology.
Document 2 (Title: Recurrent Rectal Cancer Management Following Primary Radiotherapy): Pelvic exenteration represents a potentially curative option for selected patients with recurrent rectal cancer, though previous treatments may influence subsequent surgical outcomes. Multivariate analysis of prognostic factors reveals that primary tumor radiotherapy history significantly impacts post-exenteration prognosis through several documented mechanisms. Retrospective review of 182 patients undergoing pelvic exenteration for recurrent disease demonstrated that prior radiotherapy was independently associated with reduced 5-year survival (hazard ratio 1.78, 95% CI 1.26-2.47) after controlling for other established prognostic variables. Histopathological analysis of exenteration specimens revealed that previously irradiated tumors demonstrated altered recurrence patterns, with increased likelihood of multifocal pelvic disease and perineural invasion compared to radiation-naïve recurrences. Intraoperative assessment consistently documented increased technical difficulty achieving clear margins in previously irradiated fields, with complete resection rates of 72% versus 89% in non-irradiated cases. Additionally, postoperative complication profiles showed significant differences, with prior radiotherapy associated with doubled rates of major wound complications and anastomotic failures. Tissue analysis demonstrated radiation-induced fibrosis and microvascular changes that appear to both complicate surgical procedures and potentially provide microenvironmental conditions favoring aggressive tumor biology. These findings remain significant in multivariate modeling accounting for radiation timing, dose, and fractionation schedules. Notably, neoadjuvant radiotherapy for the primary tumor demonstrated stronger negative prognostic impact than adjuvant approaches. These relationships have important implications for primary rectal cancer management decisions, as treatment approaches potentially influence salvage options for future recurrences. Emerging evidence suggests that alternative primary management strategies preserving radiation as a salvage option may warrant consideration in selected cases after accounting for these documented prognostic relationships.
Document 3 (Title: Ethylene glycol poisoning): Signs and symptoms Signs of ethylene glycol poisoning depend upon the time after ingestion. Symptoms usually follow a three step progression, although poisoned individuals will not always develop each stage. Stage 1 (30 minutes to 12 hours) consists of neurological and gastrointestinal symptoms and looks similar to alcohol poisoning. Poisoned individuals may appear to be intoxicated, dizzy, lacking coordination of muscle movements, drooling, depressed, and have slurred speech, seizures, abnormal eye movements, headaches, and confusion. Irritation to the stomach may cause nausea and vomiting. Also seen are excessive thirst and urination. Over time, the body metabolizes ethylene glycol into other toxins. Stage 2 (12 to 36 hours) where signs of “alcohol” poisoning appear to resolve, underlying severe internal damage is still occurring. An elevated heart rate, hyperventilation or increased breathing effort, and dehydration may start to develop, along with high blood pressure and metabolic acidosis. These symptoms are a result of accumulation of organic acids formed by the metabolism of ethylene glycol. Additionally low calcium concentrations in the blood, overactive muscle reflexes, muscle spasms, QT interval prolongation, and congestive heart failure may occur. If untreated, death most commonly occurs during this period. Stage 3 (24 to 72 hours) kidney failure is the result of ethylene glycol poisoning. In cats, this stage occurs 12–24 hours after consuming antifreeze; in dogs, at 36–72 hours after consuming antifreeze. During this stage, severe kidney failure is developing secondary to calcium oxalate crystals forming in the kidneys. Severe lethargy, coma, depression, vomiting, seizures, drooling, and inappetence may be seen. Other symptoms include acute tubular necrosis, red blood cells in the urine, excess proteins in the urine, lower back pain, decreased or absent production of urine, elevated blood concentration of potassium, and acute kidney failure. If kidney failure occurs it is typically reversible, although weeks or months of supportive care including hemodialysis may be required before kidney function returns.

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
Question: A 69-year-old male presents to the emergency room with back pain. He has a history of personality disorder and metastatic prostate cancer and was not a candidate for surgical resection. He began chemotherapy but discontinued due to unremitting nausea. He denies any bowel or bladder incontinence. He has never had pain like this before and is demanding morphine. The nurse administers IV morphine and he feels more comfortable. Vital signs are stable. On physical examination you note tenderness to palpation along the lower spine, weakness in the bilateral lower extremities, left greater than right. Neurological examination is also notable for hyporeflexia in the knee and ankle jerks bilaterally. You conduct a rectal examination, which reveals saddle anesthesia. Regarding this patient, what is the most likely diagnosis and the appropriate next step in management?
Options:
A. The most likely diagnosis is cauda equina syndrome and steroids should be started prior to MRI
B. The most likely diagnosis is cauda equina syndrome and steroids should be started after to MRI
C. The most likely diagnosis is cauda equina syndrome and the patient should be rushed to radiation
D. The most likely diagnosis is conus medullaris syndrome and steroids should be started prior to MRI
