        "content": "Acute limb ischemia represents a vascular emergency requiring rapid assessment and intervention to prevent permanent tissue damage and limb loss. The condition results from sudden interruption of arterial blood flow, most commonly due to embolism or thrombosis, with the lower extremities affected more frequently than upper extremities. Cardioembolic events account for approximately 80% of acute arterial emboli, with atrial fibrillation representing the predominant cardiac source. The clinical presentation follows the classic six Ps of ischemia: pain, pallor, pulselessness, paresthesia, paralysis, and poikilothermia (cold). Neurological manifestations\u2014paresthesia and paralysis\u2014represent particularly ominous signs indicating advanced ischemia with tissue compromise. Initial management focuses on preventing thrombus propagation and establishing definitive revascularization. Immediate systemic anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin constitutes the critical first therapeutic intervention, ideally administered as an intravenous bolus followed by continuous infusion titrated to therapeutic aPTT levels. This prevents thrombus propagation while diagnostic and therapeutic planning proceeds. Antiplatelet therapy with aspirin provides modest complementary benefit but should not delay anticoagulation. Revascularization options include surgical thromboembolectomy and endovascular approaches such as catheter-directed thrombolysis. Tissue plasminogen activator, while effective for cerebral ischemia within its narrow therapeutic window, carries excessive bleeding risk in peripheral arterial occlusion and requires longer infusion periods incompatible with limb salvage timeframes. The choice between surgical and endovascular approaches depends on ischemia severity, anatomic considerations, patient comorbidities, and institutional expertise, with surgery generally preferred for advanced ischemia.",

        "content": "While classic angina typically presents as substernal chest pressure exacerbated by exertion and relieved by rest or nitroglycerin, atypical presentations of myocardial ischemia occur frequently, particularly in women, diabetic patients, and elderly individuals. These variant manifestations, sometimes termed angina equivalents, include exertional dyspnea without chest discomfort, epigastric or abdominal discomfort, and jaw or arm pain without accompanying chest sensations. Upper abdominal discomfort represents a particularly challenging variant that may be misattributed to gastrointestinal etiologies, delaying appropriate cardiac evaluation. The pathophysiological basis for these atypical presentations involves complex neurological mechanisms, with cardiac nociceptive signals sharing afferent pathways with those from other visceral structures, particularly the esophagus and upper gastrointestinal tract. Patients with significant cardiovascular risk factors reporting upper abdominal discomfort that correlates with physical exertion warrant careful evaluation for potential cardiac ischemia, even in the absence of classic chest pain. Diagnostic approaches differ markedly between suspected cardiac and gastrointestinal etiologies. While endoscopic evaluation may seem intuitive for abdominal symptoms, non-invasive cardiac assessment should take precedence when the clinical presentation suggests possible angina equivalent. Exercise stress testing, with or without imaging, provides valuable diagnostic and prognostic information by detecting inducible myocardial ischemia under controlled conditions. Functional testing such as hydrogen breath testing for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth or abdominal ultrasonography for biliary disease may be appropriate in patients where cardiac etiologies have been excluded or when symptoms and risk profile suggest primary gastrointestinal pathology.",

        "content": "Abstract: 1 Blood pressure, systemic arterial compliance, and diameter, blood flow velocity, volumic flow and impedance of the brachial artery were measured before and after intravenous administration of nitroglycerin (15 micrograms/min during 15 min) in 11 patients with sustained essential hypertension. 2 For the evaluation of the diameter of the brachial artery, a bidimensional pulsed Doppler was used, enabling the angle of the ultrasound beam relative to the flowing stream of blood to be measured with an error of less than 2%. 3 After nitroglycerin, systolic pressure significantly decreased (P less than 0.01) without significant change in diastolic and mean arterial pressures, cardiac index, stroke index and total peripheral resistance. 4 Systemic arterial compliance and brachial artery diameter significantly increased (P less than 0.001; P less than 0.01) while velocity and blood flow of the brachial artery were unchanged. 5 The pattern of the input impedance of the brachial artery was consistent with a predominant effect of nitroglycerin on the viscoelastic properties of peripheral large arteries. 6 The study provided evidence that, in hypertensive patients, nitroglycerin has a direct effect on peripheral large arteries, causing an increase in arterial diameter and compliance, thus leading to a predominant decrease in systolic pressure.",
