        "title": "Ethylene glycol poisoning",
        "content": "Signs and symptoms Signs of ethylene glycol poisoning depend upon the time after ingestion. Symptoms usually follow a three step progression, although poisoned individuals will not always develop each stage. Stage 1 (30 minutes to 12 hours) consists of neurological and gastrointestinal symptoms and looks similar to alcohol poisoning. Poisoned individuals may appear to be intoxicated, dizzy, lacking coordination of muscle movements, drooling, depressed, and have slurred speech, seizures, abnormal eye movements, headaches, and confusion. Irritation to the stomach may cause nausea and vomiting. Also seen are excessive thirst and urination. Over time, the body metabolizes ethylene glycol into other toxins. Stage 2 (12 to 36 hours) where signs of \u201calcohol\u201d poisoning appear to resolve, underlying severe internal damage is still occurring. An elevated heart rate, hyperventilation or increased breathing effort, and dehydration may start to develop, along with high blood pressure and metabolic acidosis. These symptoms are a result of accumulation of organic acids formed by the metabolism of ethylene glycol. Additionally low calcium concentrations in the blood, overactive muscle reflexes, muscle spasms, QT interval prolongation, and congestive heart failure may occur. If untreated, death most commonly occurs during this period. Stage 3 (24 to 72 hours) kidney failure is the result of ethylene glycol poisoning. In cats, this stage occurs 12\u201324 hours after consuming antifreeze; in dogs, at 36\u201372 hours after consuming antifreeze. During this stage, severe kidney failure is developing secondary to calcium oxalate crystals forming in the kidneys. Severe lethargy, coma, depression, vomiting, seizures, drooling, and inappetence may be seen. Other symptoms include acute tubular necrosis, red blood cells in the urine, excess proteins in the urine, lower back pain, decreased or absent production of urine, elevated blood concentration of potassium, and acute kidney failure. If kidney failure occurs it is typically reversible, although weeks or months of supportive care including hemodialysis may be required before kidney function returns.",

        "title": "Zoonotic Viral Encephalitides: Modes of Transmission and Clinical Manifestations",
        "content": "Rabies virus, a neurotropic rhabdovirus of the Lyssavirus genus, represents one of the most lethal infectious diseases, with near-universal fatality once clinical symptoms develop. Transmission typically occurs through percutaneous exposure to infected saliva via animal bites, though alternative routes including mucosal exposure and aerosol inhalation have been documented in specific environmental contexts. The pathophysiological sequence begins at the inoculation site, where initial viral replication occurs within muscle tissue. Subsequently, the virus enters peripheral nerves, exploiting retrograde axonal transport to access the central nervous system. This neural progression explains the variable incubation period (typically 3-12 weeks) influenced by wound location and distance from the central nervous system. Prodromal symptoms include fever, malaise, headache, and often paresthesia or pruritus at the inoculation site. As the infection progresses to the clinical stage, patients develop the pathognomonic features of encephalitic (furious) rabies: hyperexcitability, autonomic dysfunction, hydrophobia, aerophobia, and ultimately paralysis leading to respiratory failure. Hydrophobia, the characteristic fear of water, stems from painful pharyngeal muscle spasms triggered by swallowing attempts, while hypersalivation results from dysphagia combined with increased secretion. The paralytic form presents with ascending flaccid paralysis resembling Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, complicating early diagnosis. Exposure risk varies significantly by geographic region and animal reservoir. Traditional sources include canids (dogs, foxes, wolves), raccoons, and skunks, though any mammal may potentially transmit the virus. Bats represent a particularly concerning vector due to their widespread distribution, potential for inapparent exposure through minor bites, and documented transmission through inhalation of aerosolized viral particles in enclosed spaces with dense bat populations. Cave exploration (spelunking), particularly in bat-inhabited caves, represents a recognized risk factor, with multiple documented cases of presumed aerosol transmission in cavers without recognized bat bites. Preventive measures focus on post-exposure prophylaxis, including wound cleansing, rabies immune globulin, and vaccination, which remains highly effective when promptly administered following exposure.",

        "content": "Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) remains a leading cause of death in infants between one month and one year of age, with peak incidence between two and four months. Following comprehensive epidemiological studies and the introduction of targeted preventive measures, SIDS rates have declined significantly over the past three decades. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and similar organizations worldwide have established evidence-based recommendations focusing on modifiable risk factors. The single most effective intervention involves infant sleep positioning, with clear evidence demonstrating that placing infants on their backs (supine position) on a firm sleep surface reduces SIDS risk by approximately 50%. This 'Back to Sleep' campaign has been credited with the dramatic reduction in SIDS rates since its introduction in the 1990s. Contrary to previous practices, maintaining a high ambient room temperature and excessive bundling are now recognized as potential risk factors rather than protective measures. Similarly, the use of positioning devices, wedges, or rolled blankets to maintain sleep position is discouraged due to suffocation risks. While some studies suggested that pacifier use during sleep might confer modest protective effects, avoiding pacifiers was not found to reduce SIDS risk. Current guidelines emphasize room-sharing without bed-sharing, avoiding soft bedding or objects in the sleep environment, and eliminating exposure to tobacco smoke as additional key preventive strategies.",
