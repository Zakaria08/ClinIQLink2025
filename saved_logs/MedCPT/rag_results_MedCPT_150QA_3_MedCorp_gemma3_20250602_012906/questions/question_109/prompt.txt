Document 1 (Title: Antianginal and anti-ischemic efficacy of nicorandil compared with nifedipine in patients with angina pectoris and coronary heart disease: a double-blind, randomized, multicenter study.): Patients with stable, effort-induced angina pectoris and a typical combination of anginal pain and ischemic ST depression in exercise tolerance tests were randomized to treatment for 8 weeks with nicorandil (a newly developed antianginal and anti-ischemic drug) or nifedipine. After 4 weeks, the dosage of nicorandil was increased from 10 mg b.i.d. to 20 mg b.i.d., but the recommended dosage of nifedipine, 20 mg b.i.d., was kept constant during the study period. Double-blind treatment was preceded by a 2-week prephase during which patients were treated with isosorbide dinitrate. During the study period, patients were asked to report the rate of anginal attacks and consumption of sublingual nitroglycerin. Measurements of blood pressure and heart rate at rest and during exercise always were performed 2 h after drug intake. Fifty-eight patients were randomized--29 to nicorandil and 29 to nifedipine. There were large individual variations in anginal attack rates, which makes group comparisons difficult, but in the ...
Document 2 (Title: Role of nitrates in angina pectoris.): Nitrates are used extensively for the treatment of angina pectoris. However, continuous therapy with either oral nitrates or nitroglycerin patches leads to rapid development of tolerance, with loss or diminution of antianginal and anti-ischemic effects. The only practical way to avoid the development of tolerance is to use intermittent daily therapy with nitrates. Nitroglycerin patches applied for 10-12 hours during the day increase exercise duration for 8-12 hours, but a rebound increase in anginal attacks during the nitrate-free interval may occur. Oral isosorbide-5-mononitrate, 20 mg twice a day, with the first dose administered in the morning and the second dose 7 hours later, increases exercise duration for at least 12 hours without the development of tolerance to either the morning or afternoon dose. This dosing regimen has been shown not to produce a rebound phenomenon during the periods of low nitrate levels at night and early hours of the morning. Isosorbide dinitrate (30 mg) prescribed at 7 AM and 1...
Document 3 (Title: Variant angina): As maintenance therapy, sublingual nitroglycerin tablets can be taken 3-5 min before conducting activity that causes angina by the small percentage of patients who experience angina infrequently and only when doing such activity. For most afflicted individuals, antianginals are used as maintenance therapy to avoid attacks of variant angina. Calcium channel blockers of the dihydropyridine class (e.g. nifedipine, amlodipine) or non-dihydropyridine class (e.g. verapamil, diltiazem) are regarded as first-line drugs to avoid angina attacks. Long-acting nitroglycerins such as isosorbide dinitrate or intermittent use of short-acting nitroglycerin (to treat acute symptoms) may be added to the calcium channel blocker regimen in individuals responding sub-optimally to the channel blockers. However, individuals commonly develop tolerance, i.e. resistance, to the efficacy of continuously used long-acting nitroglycerin formulations. One strategy to avoid this development is to schedule
