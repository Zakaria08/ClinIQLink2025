Document 1 (Title: Comparison of the plasma levels of apolipoproteins B and A-1, and other risk factors in men and women with premature coronary artery disease.): The predictors of premature coronary atherosclerosis were examined in 203 patients (99 men aged less than or equal to 50 years, and 104 women aged less than or equal to 60 years) undergoing elective diagnostic coronary arteriography. Age, cigarette smoking, hypertension, obesity, diabetes, positive family history of premature coronary artery disease (CAD), and plasma levels of total cholesterol, triglyceride, lipoproteins (i.e., very low, intermediate-, low-, and high-density [HDL] lipoproteins and their subfractions [HDL2 and HDL3], and lipoprotein [a]) and apolipoproteins (apoA-1, apoA-2 and apoB, respectively) were examined using univariate analyses and multivariate logistic regression. In men, age (p less than 0.05), smoking (p less than 0.05), and plasma triglyceride (p less than 0.02) and apoA-1 (p less than 0.05) levels were independently associated with CAD. In women, smoking (p less than 0.001) and plasma apoB levels (p less than 0.04) were the strongest variables independently associated with CAD. I...
Document 2 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Epicardial coronary arteries are the major site of atherosclerotic disease. The major risk factors for atherosclerosis (high levels of plasma low-density lipoprotein [LDL], low plasma high-density lipoprotein [HDL], cigarette smoking, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus [Chap. 291e]) disturb the normal functions of the vascular endothelium. These functions include local control of vascular tone, maintenance of an antithrombotic surface, and control of inflammatory cell adhesion and diapedesis. The loss of these defenses leads to inappropriate constriction, luminal thrombus formation, and abnormal interactions between blood cells, especially monocytes and platelets, and the activated vascular endothelium. Functional changes in the vascular milieu ultimately result in the subintimal collections of fat, smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, and intercellular matrix that define the atherosclerotic plaque. Rather than viewing atherosclerosis strictly as a vascular problem, it is useful to
Document 3 (Title: Lipoprotein(a)): The European Atherosclerosis Society currently recommends that patients with a moderate or high risk of cardiovascular disease should have their Lp(a) levels checked. Any patient with one of the following risk factors should be screened: premature cardiovascular disease familial hypercholesterolaemia family history of premature cardiovascular disease family history of elevated Lp(a) recurrent cardiovascular disease despite statin treatment ≥3% ten-year risk of fatal cardiovascular disease according to the European guidelines ≥10% ten-year risk of fatal and/or non-fatal cardiovascular disease according to the U.S. guidelines If the level is elevated, treatment should be initiated to bring the level below 50 mg/dL. In addition, the patient's other cardiovascular risk factors (including LDL levels) should be managed optimally. Apart from the total Lp(a) plasma concentration, the apo(a) isoform might be an important risk parameter as well.

Question: Select the risk factor(s) for coronary artery disease:
Options:
1. Smoking
2. High plasma concentration of apolipoprotein B
3. High plasma concentration of HDL
4. Hypertension
5. High plasma level of Lp(a)
