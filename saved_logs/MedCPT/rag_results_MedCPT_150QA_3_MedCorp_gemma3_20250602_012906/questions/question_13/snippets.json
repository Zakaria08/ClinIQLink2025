        "title": "Paroxysmal electroencephalographic abnormalities genetically transmitted: one family description.",
        "content": "A 10-year-old girl came to our observation since a general rule-out electroencephalogram (EEG) had showed, in absence of any clinical manifestation, generalized and symmetrical 3 c/s spike-and-wave bursts, whose duration was longer than 3 s. The subject, only daughter born from her mother's first marriage, had no family history of neurological diseases; her physical and neuropsychological examinations were normal. A polysomnographic recording showed, during sleep, the same abnormalities observed during wakefulness. Also on this occasion, there were no related clinical manifestations. Subsequent recordings were performed on her 33-year-old mother and on two siblings, 3 and 2 years old, respectively, born from their mother's second marriage, all normal by physical and neuropsychological examinations, with no referral about clinical seizures. Among them, the 3-year-old sister showed asymptomatic left rolandic spikes, while the 2-year-old boy, whose EEG was firstly normal, displayed, 1 year later, a burst of generalized 3 c/s spike-and-wave paroxysmal activity on a 4-7 c/s background activity. The possible unitary genetic transmission of paroxysmal EEG abnormalities is discussed.",

        "content": "LNs have been reported in patients with segmental neurofibromatosis, which is due to a somatic mutation of the neurofibromin gene. [19] A case has been reported describing the presence of LN in a 47-year-old male with NF2 where the patient had bilateral sensorineural deafness and progressive ataxia. MRI revealed the appearance of bilateral acoustic neuromas. Multiple LNs were present in his right eye. [5] A single case report described the presence of unilateral LN with cafe-au-lait macules on the same side of the body. [21] LNs are also reported in patients with Watson syndrome characterized by cafe-au-lait macules, pulmonary valvular stenosis, and mental retardation. [9] A case report described a 43-year-old male with NF1 whose one of the sisters had multiple LNs, while her elder daughter had only one LN. Neither of these 2 patients had any signs of cutaneous or systemic neurofibromatosis. Therefore, LNs are the ocular marker of NF1 in otherwise normal family members of patients with NF1. [9] A case report described a 21-year-old healthy White woman diagnosed to have multiple, unilateral LNs in the absence of additional features of NF1. [22] She, however, had a solitary 5 mm hypopigmented macule on her back under Wood's light illumination. [22]",

        "title": "Auguste Deter",
        "content": "After many years, she became completely demented, muttering to herself. She died on 8 April 1906. More than a century later, her case was re-examined with modern medical technologies, where a genetic cause was found for her disease by scientists from Gießen and Sydney. The results were published in the journal The Lancet Neurology. According to this paper, a mutation in the PSEN1 gene was found, which alters the gamma-secretase function and is a known cause of early-onset Alzheimer's disease. However, the results could not be replicated in a more recent paper published in 2014 where \"Auguste D's DNA revealed no indication of a nonsynonymous hetero- or homozygous mutation in the exons of APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 genes comprising the already known familial AD mutations.\" It is suggested that Auguste's daughter Thekla would have had a 50% chance of inheriting the PSEN1 gene and developing Alzheimer's, although there is no recorded information of her developing such an illness. No doubt that",
