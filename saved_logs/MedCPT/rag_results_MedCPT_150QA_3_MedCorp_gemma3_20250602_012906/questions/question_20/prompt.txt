Document 1 (Title: Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) -- Evaluation): The diagnosis of NAFLD/NASH is often made incidentally when routine lab tests show abnormal liver biochemical tests or imagining tests show hepatic steatosis or hepatomegaly. Imaging modalities include ultrasonography, computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Ultrasonography, however, is most widely used as it is the least expensive and most available modality. A diagnosis of NAFLD should be made only in the absence of excessive alcohol intake (defined as alcohol consumption of more than 20 g/day for men and more than 10 g/day for women), and other causes of liver disease such as viral hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis, hereditary or drug-induced liver disease. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) are usually mildly elevated at two to five times the upper level of normal with ALT greater than AST in a 2:1 ratio. This pattern of serum aminotransferase elevation helps distinguish NAFLD from alcoholic hepatitis, as the AST is usually greater than ALT in alcoholi...
Document 2 (Title: Jaundice): Some bone and heart disorders can lead to an increase in ALP and the aminotransferases, so the first step in differentiating these from liver problems is to compare the levels of GGT, which are only elevated in liver-specific conditions. The second step is distinguishing from biliary (cholestatic) or liver causes of jaundice and altered laboratory results. ALP and GGT levels typically rise with one pattern while aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) rise in a separate pattern. If the ALP (10–45 IU/l) and GGT (18–85 IU/l) levels rise proportionately as high as the AST (12–38 IU/l) and ALT (10–45 IU/l) levels, this indicates a cholestatic problem. If the AST and ALT rise is significantly higher than the ALP and GGT rise, though, this indicates a liver problem. Finally, distinguishing between liver causes of jaundice, comparing levels of AST and ALT can prove useful. AST levels typically are higher than ALT. This remains the case in most liver disorders
Document 3 (Title: Isoniazid -- Monitoring): In all adults preparing to begin INH treatment, the clinician should order baseline measurements of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, serum creatinine, and platelet count. Regular monitoring of hepatic and renal function during treatment is unnecessary unless the patient has abnormal baseline levels or is at increased risk for hepatotoxicity such as alcohol misuse and hepatitis B or C infection. Serum transaminases should be measured again 2 to 4 weeks after treatment initiation for those patients. [1] In patients with pulmonary TB, monthly sputum specimens are necessary (until 2 consecutive negative cultures) to assess response to treatment. Patients with poor compliance history should be monitored with a urine test. Isoscreen test checks for INH metabolites in the urine. [28] [29]

Question: A previously healthy 36-year-old man comes to the physician for a yellow discoloration of his skin and dark-colored urine for 2 weeks. He does not drink any alcohol. Physical examination shows jaundice. Abdominal and neurologic examinations show no abnormalities. Serum studies show increased levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). A liver biopsy is performed and a photomicrograph after periodic acid-Schiff-staining is shown. Which of the following is the most likely additional finding in this patient?
Options:
A. Bullous changes of the lung bases on chest CT
B. Beading of intra- and extrahepatic bile ducts on ERCP
C. Myocardial iron deposition on cardiovascular MRI
D. Dark corneal ring on slit-lamp examination
