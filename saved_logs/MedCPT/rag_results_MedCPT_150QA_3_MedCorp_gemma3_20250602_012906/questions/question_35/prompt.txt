Document 2 (Title: Community-acquired pneumonia): Hospitalization Some CAP patients require intensive care, with clinical prediction rules such as the pneumonia severity index and CURB-65 guiding the decision whether or not to hospitalize. Factors increasing the need for hospitalization include: Age greater than 65 Underlying chronic illnesses Respiratory rate greater than 30 per minute Systolic blood pressure less than 90 mmHg Heart rate greater than 125 per minute Temperature below 35 or over 40 °C Confusion Evidence of infection outside the lung Laboratory results indicating hospitalization include: Arterial oxygen tension less than 60 mm Hg Carbon dioxide over 50 mmHg or pH under 7.35 while breathing room air Hematocrit under 30 percent Creatinine over 1.2 mg/dl or blood urea nitrogen over 20 mg/dl White-blood-cell count under 4 × 10^9/L or over 30 × 10^9/L Neutrophil count under 1 x 10^9/L
Document 3 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): Philip J. Rosenthal, MD A 5-year-old American girl presents with a 1-week history of intermittent chills, fever, and sweats. She had returned home 2 weeks earlier after leaving the USA for the first time to spend 3 weeks with her grandparents in Nigeria. She received all standard childhood immunizations, but no additional treat-ment before travel, since her parents have returned to their native Nigeria frequently without medical consequences. Three days ago, the child was seen in an outpatient clinic and diagnosed with a viral syndrome. Examination reveals a lethargic child, with a temperature of 39.8°C (103.6°F) and splenomegaly. She has no skin rash or lymphadenopathy. Ini-tial laboratory studies are remarkable for hematocrit 29.8%, platelets 45,000/mm3, creatinine 2.5 mg/dL (220 μmol/L), and mildly elevated bilirubin and transaminases. A blood smear shows ring forms of Plasmodium falciparum at 1.5% parasit-emia. What treatment should be started?

Question: A 19-year-old woman, accompanied by her parents, presents after a one-week history of abnormal behavior, delusions, and unusual aggression. She denies fever, seizures or illicit drug use. Family history is negative for psychiatric illnesses. She was started on risperidone and sent home with her parents. Three days later, she is brought to the emergency department with fever and confusion. She is not verbally responsive. At the hospital, her temperature is 39.8°C (103.6°F), the blood pressure is 100/60 mm Hg, the pulse rate is 102/min, and the respiratory rate is 16/min. She is extremely diaphoretic and appears stiff. She has spontaneous eye-opening but she is not verbally responsive and she is not following commands. Laboratory studies show: Sodium 142 mmol/L Potassium 5.0 mmol/L Creatinine 1.8 mg/dl Calcium 10.4 mg/dl Creatine kinase 9800 U/L White blood cells 14,500/mm3 Hemoglobin 12.9 g/dl Platelets 175,000/mm3 Urinalysis shows protein 1+, hemoglobin 3+ with occasional leukocytes and no red blood casts. What is the best first step in the management of this condition?
Options:
A. Intravenous hydration
