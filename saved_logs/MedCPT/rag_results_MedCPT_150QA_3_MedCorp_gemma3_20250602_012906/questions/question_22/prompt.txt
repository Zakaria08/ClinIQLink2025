Document 1 (Title: Microdialysis studies of brain norepinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine release during ingestive behavior. Theoretical and clinical implications.): This minireview deals with the possible roles of monoamines in feeding and feeding disorders. The introduction sketches the results of earlier studies with local drug injections and selective neurotoxins which provided pharmacological evidence that monoamines can influence food intake and body weight. A table summarizing this evidence is used to list monoamine changes that could underlie anorexia or hyperphagia. It is apparent that abnormalities in the monoamines, along with their cotransmitters, could cause many forms of feeding disorder. It is proposed as a working hypothesis that several varieties of hyperphagia leading to obesity have a common element. This common factor is a change in excitability of a lateral hypothalamic reinforcement system as manifested in self-stimulation at a stimulation-bound feeding site. Understanding this feeding reward-aversion system helps us understand hyperphagia and anorexia. The neurochemistry of reward and aversion involves the monoamines. This paper focuses on dopamine ...
Document 2 (Title: Influence of photoinhibition, photostimulation and prolactin on pituitary and hypothalamic nuclear androgen receptors in the male hamster.): Testosterone (T) feedback sensitivity is markedly altered in adult male golden hamsters following exposure to short photoperiods (SD). Using a technique which measures total androgen receptors within the cell nucleus, the present study examined pituitary and hypothalamic nuclear androgen receptor levels in animals exposed to (1) long days (LD) or SD in the presence and absence of a constant T level supplied via a Silastic implant, (2) photostimulation following SD-induced testicular regression and (3) short-term prolactin injections following SD-induced testicular regression. Short photoperiods were associated with a drop in nuclear androgen receptor levels which was correlated with a decline in circulating T. When constant T was supplied to gonadectomized hamsters, those exposed to SD possessed higher pituitary and similar hypothalamic nuclear androgen receptor levels than those exposed to LD. As expected, plasma luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels were greatly reduced in S...
Document 3 (Title: Cell_Biology_Alberts): A gene encoding channelrhodopsin was introduced into a subpopulation of neurons in the hypothalamus of a mouse. When the neurons were exposed to flashing blue light using a tiny, implanted fiber optic cable, the channelrhodopsin channels opened, depolarizing and activating the cells. When the light was switched on, the mouse immediately became aggressive and attacked the inflated rubber glove; when the light was switched off, its behavior immediately returned to normal (Movie 11.11). (From D. Lin et al., Nature 470:221–226, 2011. With permission from Macmillan Publishers Ltd.) inactivate specific neurons. It is therefore now possible to transiently activate or inhibit specific neurons in the brains of awake animals with remarkable spatial and temporal precision. In this way, the rapidly expanding new field of optogenetics is revolutionizing neurobiology, allowing neuroscientists to analyze the neurons and circuits underlying even the most complex behaviors in experimental animals,

Question: An investigator is studying the function of the lateral nucleus of the hypothalamus in an experimental animal. Using a viral vector, the genes encoding chloride-conducting channelrhodopsins are injected into this nucleus. Photostimulation of the channels causes complete inhibition of action potential generation. Persistent photostimulation is most likely to result in which of the following abnormalities in these animals?
Options:
A. Hypothermia
B. Hyperthermia
C. Polydipsia
D. Anorexia
