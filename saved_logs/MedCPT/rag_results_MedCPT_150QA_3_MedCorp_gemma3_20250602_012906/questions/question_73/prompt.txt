Document 1 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Nomograms To better assess risk and guide treatment selection, many groups have developed prognostic models or nomograms that use a combination of the initial clinical T stage, biopsy Gleason score, and baseline PSA. Some use discrete cut points (PSA <10 or ≥10 ng/mL; Gleason score of ≤6, 7, or ≥8); others employ nomograms that use PSA and Gleason score as continuous variables. More than 100 nomograms have been reported to predict the probability that a clinically significant prostate cancer is present, disease extent (organ-confined vs non–organ-confined, node-negative or -positive), or the probability of success of treatment for specific local therapies using pretreatment variables. Considerable controversy exists over what constitutes “high risk” based on a predicted probability of success or failure. In these situations, nomograms and predictive models can only go so far. Exactly what probability of success or failure would lead a physician to recommend and a patient to seek
Document 2 (Title: Prostate Cancer Tissue-Based Biomarkers -- Diagnostic Tests -- Tissue-Based Biomarkers): The Prolaris prostate cancer prognostic test is used in two clinical scenarios: newly diagnosed patients with prostate cancer (Prolaris biopsy test) and after radical prostatectomy (Prolaris post-prostatectomy test). Results are given as Cell Cycle Progression (CCP) scores of 0 to 6. The clinical endpoint is the 10-year risk of prostate cancer-specific mortality as well as the 10-year risk of biochemical recurrence (BCR) after radical prostatectomy. [51] [52] [53]
Document 3 (Title: The use of prostate specific antigen density to enhance the predictive value of intermediate levels of serum prostate specific antigen.): Prostate specific antigen (PSA) is an extremely valuable tumor marker. However, its use in detection is limited by its low positive and negative predictive values. The ability of serum PSA to distinguish between benign and malignant prostatic conditions is particularly poor in the intermediate range of 4.1 and 10 ng./ml. by the Hybritech assay. We used transrectal ultrasound determined prostate volumes in a well characterized population of 533 men to form a serum PSA/prostate volume ratio called prostate specific antigen density (PSAD). The prevalence of cancer in the entire population was 18.4%. Discriminant analysis according to negative or positive outcome allowed for the construction of nomograms, which resulted in a PSAD defined cancer risk ranging from 3 to 100%. Predictive value nomograms created from PSAD may allow for a more individualized approach to evaluation of patients with intermediate levels of Hybritech serum PSA.

Question: Do nomograms designed to predict biochemical recurrence (BCR) do a better job of predicting more clinically relevant prostate cancer outcomes than BCR?
