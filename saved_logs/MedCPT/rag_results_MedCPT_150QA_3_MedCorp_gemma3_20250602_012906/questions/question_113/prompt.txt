Document 1 (Title: Plasmodium falciparum): P. falciparum does not have a fixed structure but undergoes continuous change during the course of its life cycle. A sporozoite is spindle-shaped and 10–15 μm long. In the liver it grows into an ovoid schizont of 30–70 μm in diameter. Each schizont produces merozoites, each of which is roughly 1.5 μm in length and 1 μm in diameter. In the erythrocyte the merozoite form a ring-like structure, becoming a trophozoite. A trophozoites feed on the haemoglobin and forms a granular pigment called haemozoin. Unlike those of other Plasmodium species, the gametocytes of P. falciparum are elongated and crescent-shaped, by which they are sometimes identified. A mature gametocyte is 8–12 μm long and 3–6 μm wide. The ookinete is also elongated measuring about 18–24 μm. An oocyst is rounded and can grow up to 80 μm in diameter. Microscopic examination of a blood film reveals only early (ring-form) trophozoites and gametocytes that are in the peripheral blood. Mature trophozoites or schizonts in
Document 2 (Title: [Study of gametocytes from the Plasmodium "vivax" group: morphology, development in Anopheles and infectivity of Plasmodium yoelii microgametocytes].): The study of the gametocytes of Plasmodium yoelii enabled the differentiation of 4 morphological types: O, I, II and III (in a chronological order) and amongst each of these types the differentiation of healthy and altered gametocytes. These morphological data represent a tool for investigations on the biology of the gametocytes of the "vivax" group. Preliminary experiments bring informations on the evolution of gametocytes and the mechanisms of their infectivity. 1--In experimentaly infected white mice gametocytes of P.y. nigeriensis are infective up to the 3rd-4th day, those of P. y. yoelii until the 5th-6th days. These periods can be shorter when the infection is very virulent or longer when chronical. 2--The drop in infectivity coincides with the increase in number of the altered gametocytes. 3--The loss of infectivity is connected with the condition of the blood: when parasitaemiae are high, it becomes rapidly unsuitable to a normal evolution of the gametocytes: thus, non infective gametocytes acquire a ...
Document 3 (Title: Malaria -- Pathophysiology): Five Plasmodium species possess the ability to infect humans: P. falciparum, P. ovale, P. vivax, P. malariae , and P. knowlesi . [2] The female Anopheles mosquito ingests gametes during a blood meal, which form sporozoites that replicate in the gut. [1] During subsequent bloodmeals, saliva containing sporozoites gets released into a human host's bloodstream. [1] Within 60 minutes, sporozoites reach the liver, invade hepatocytes, and then rapidly divide, forming merozoites. In an active infection, organisms reenter the bloodstream and invade erythrocytes. [1] [4] Within erythrocytes, Plasmodia consume hemoglobin and develop from immature trophozoites (ring stage) to either mature trophozoites or gametocytes (CDC Malaria 2019). Mature trophozoites replicate, forming schizonts, disrupting erythrocyte cell membrane integrity, and leading to capillary endothelial adherence and cell lysis. [1]
