Document 1 (Title: First_Aid_Step1): Trimethoprim, mecHaNism Similar to sulfonamides, but structurally distinct Purines Thymidine Methionine agent. cliNical Use Leprosy (lepromatous and tuberculoid), DNA, RNA DNA Protein Pneumocystis jirovecii prophylaxis, or treatment when used in combination with TMP. aDVerse eFFects Hemolysis if G6PD deficient, methemoglobinemia, agranulocytosis. mecHaNism Inhibits bacterial dihydrofolate reductase. Bacteriostatic. cliNical Use Used in combination with sulfonamides (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole [TMPSMX]), causing sequential block of folate synthesis. Combination used for UTIs, Shigella, Salmonella, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia treatment and prophylaxis, toxoplasmosis prophylaxis. aDVerse eFFects Hyperkalemia (high doses), megaloblastic anemia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, which may be avoided with coadministration of leucovorin (folinic acid). TMP Treats Marrow Poorly.
Document 2 (Title: Adverse effects of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in a child with dihydropteridine reductase deficiency.): A child with dihydropteridine reductase (DHPR) deficiency developed signs of dopamine insufficiency after being given trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX). She recovered function after the antibiotic was stopped, which suggests that it adversely influenced dopamine metabolism in the CNS. The authors speculate that TMP, a dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor, was the major cause of the patient's deterioration, and suggest that it and other dihydrofolate inhibitors, notably methotrexate, are contra-indicated for patients with DHPR deficiency.
Document 3 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): Mechanism of Action Trimethoprim, a trimethoxybenzylpyrimidine, selectively inhibits bacterial dihydrofolic acid reductase, which converts dihydrofolic acid to tetrahydrofolic acid, a step leading to the synthesis of purines and ultimately to DNA (Figure 46–2). Trimethoprim is a much less efficient inhibitor of mammalian dihydrofolic acid reductase. The combination of trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole is often bactericidal, compared with the bacteriostatic activity of a sulfonamide alone.

Question: Select the correct statement(s) regarding co-trimoxazole:
Options:
1. Is an association of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim
2. Is indicated in the treatment of toxoplasmosis
3. Trimethoprim is an inhibitor of dihydrofolate synthetase
4. Can cause severe skin disorders such as Lyell syndrome
5. Combination with methotrexate is contraindicated
