        "content": "Physicians are frequently consulted by patients who suffer from some derangement of sleep. Most often, the problem is one of sleeplessness, but sometimes it concerns excessive sleepiness or some peculiar phenomenon occurring in connection with sleep. Certain points concerning normal sleep and the sleep–wake mechanisms are worth reviewing, as familiarity with them is necessary for an understanding of disorders of sleep. A great deal of information about sleep and sleep abnormalities is now available as a result of the development of the subspecialty of sleep medicine and the existence of centers for the diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders. Most disorders of sleep can be readily recognized if one attends closely to the patient’s description of the disturbance. Cases requiring the documentation of apneic episodes or those with more complex disorders such as seizures and other motor symptoms during sleep, benefit from attention in sleep laboratories.",

        "title": "Unrecognized association of sleep disorders and depression with chronic pelvic pain.",
        "content": "Assessment of cases of chronic pelvic pain presents a challenging problem, and many physicians overlook the association of sleep disorders and depression with such pain. We examined these linkages in our chronic pelvic pain clinic, using a questionnaire that assists in diagnosis and management of these cases. To date, the cases of 72 patients (both physician- and self-referred) with pelvic pain have been evaluated. Of these patients, 51 of 71 (72%) reported sleep disorders, and 37 of 72 (51%) had clinical depression, as determined by the Beck Depression Inventory. After adjustment for a sleep-related item on the Beck scale, these two measures showed a positive correlation of .355 (P &lt; .01). The scores of pain patients differed significantly from those of a control group of asymptomatic patients on the depression and sleep disorder measures. By being aware and using a simple questionnaire, the clinician may readily identify overlooked factors, such as sleep disorders and depression, when assessing cases of chronic pelvic pain.",

        "title": "Studies in the genetics of obstructive sleep apnea. Familial aggregation of symptoms associated with sleep-related breathing disturbances.",
        "content": "Previous studies of single families have suggested that familial factors may be important in the pathogenesis of obstructive sleep apnea. In this report, the role of inheritance in obstructive sleep apnea was assessed by quantitating the degree of familial clustering of symptoms associated with sleep-related breathing disorders. In total, 272 subjects from 29 families identified through an index case with obstructive sleep apnea and 21 control families with no relative known to have sleep apnea were studied with questionnaires that ascertained health status and symptoms. The unadjusted odds ratios of habitual or disruptive snoring, breathing pauses, and excessive day-time sleepiness in subjects with a single relative with the same symptom were 1.40 to 1.53 (p less than 0.05). Odds ratios increased progressively for subjects with increasing numbers of symptomatic relatives). Adjustment for body mass index, age, and gender modestly reduced these odds ratios to 1.33 to 1.42. These data suggest a significant familial aggregation of symptoms associated with sleep-disordered breathing that appears independent of familial similarities in weight.",
