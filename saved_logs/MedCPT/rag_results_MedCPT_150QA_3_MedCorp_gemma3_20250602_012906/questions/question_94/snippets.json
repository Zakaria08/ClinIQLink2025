        "title": "Transplantation of kidneys from pediatric cadaver donors to adult recipients.",
        "content": "Pediatric donors (less than 12 years old) are a potentially important source of kidneys for adult recipients. Previous reports of decreased graft survival and increased complication rates have made surgeons wary of using such kidneys. In 64 kidneys from younger donors transplanted to adult recipients the delayed graft function rate (41 versus 42%), and 2 and 3-year graft survival rates (67 versus 72% and 61 versus 65%, respectively) were similar to those seen with kidneys from adult donors. Kidneys from donors 24 months old or less experienced an 80% rate of graft loss at 1 year. When these kidneys are excluded the 1-year graft survival rate was similar to kidneys from older and younger donors (70 versus 77%). Mean serum creatinine at 1 year was similar in both groups (155 +/- 21 versus 151 +/- 10). Pediatric kidneys except those obtained from donors 2 years old or less are suitable for adult recipients. However, kidneys from very young donors may be more appropriate to pediatric recipients.",

The approach can be performed in a minimally invasive fashion or, less commonly nowadays, via open surgery for the living donor. Implantation in the recipient is performed in an open fashion, where the kidney is placed heterotopically in the pelvis, anastomosing the vessels to the external iliac vessels and the ureter to the bladder. The iliac vessels are preferentially exposed retroperitoneally as the peritoneum is retracted medially. However, intra-peritoneal placement is also acceptable.",
