Document 1 (Title: Inappropriate Medication in the Geriatric Population -- Introduction): Potentially inappropriate medications (PIM) can be defined as drugs that pose an increased risk of causing adverse events. [1] The American Geriatrics Society Beers Criteria® is a set of recommendations for avoiding PIMs in the geriatric population. [2] Initially published in 1991, the AGS Beers Criteria® has been periodically updated to provide more accurate and practical guidelines for healthcare providers. [3] [4] [1] The AGS Beers Criteria® is consistently revised by an interprofessional team utilizing an evidence-based approach. [3] [5] The latest version of the AGS Beers Criteria® was written in 2019 to assist practicing clinicians in outpatient, acute, and institutional settings. It includes medications evaluated in 5 main categories: drugs to avoid, drugs to use with caution, drug-drug interactions, medications to avoid in particular clinical situations, and dosage according to kidney function.

Document 2 (Title: Gynecology_Novak): Small areas of low volume bleeding can be treated with topical hemostatic agents. Topical agents such as microfibrillar collagen are available in 5-mm and 10-mm diameter laparoscopic applicators (Fig. 23.13). Fibrin sealants (e.g., Tisseel®) and bovine thrombin and gelatin (Floseal®)can also be used. A solution of dilute vasopressin may be injected locally to maintain hemostasis for myomectomy or removal of ectopic pregnancy.
Document 3 (Title: Inappropriate Medication in the Geriatric Population -- Other Issues -- Limitations to the AGS Beers Criteria®): The AGS Beers Criteria® complements clinical judgment and decision-making and should not be used independently to add or remove medications for patients. Treatment should be individualized, understanding that patients are complex and conditions differ between individuals . [3] The AGS Beers Criteria® does not always apply to hospitalized and palliative care patients. Risk-benefit ratios vary in these settings, and there are innumerable scenarios to consider. [3] [4] Finally, the AGS Beers Criteria® was validated using evidence from the United States and is not necessarily applicable in all countries. [3]
