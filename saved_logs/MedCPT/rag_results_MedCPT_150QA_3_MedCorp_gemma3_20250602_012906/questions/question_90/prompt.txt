Document 1 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): Systemic che-motherapy is recommended in almost all cases of distant spread. However, unlike many other malignancies, highly selected patients with isolated, resectable metastases may benefit from resection (metastasectomy). The most common site of metasta-sis is the liver. Of patients with systemic disease, approximately 15% will have metastases limited to the liver. Of these, 20% are potentially resectable for cure. Survival is improved in these patients (20–40% 5-year survival) when compared to patients who do not undergo resection. Hepatic resection of synchronous metastases from colorectal carcinoma may be performed as a combined procedure or in two stages. The second most com-mon site of metastasis is the lung, occurring in approximately 20% of patients with colorectal carcinoma. Although very few of these patients will be potentially resectable, among those who are (about 1–2% of all colorectal cancer patients), long-term survival benefit is approximately 30% to 40%. There are
Document 2 (Title: Surgical management of patients with primary operable colorectal cancer and synchronous liver metastases.): The surgical results were analyzed of 217 patients who had undergone operation for primary colorectal cancer and were found to have synchronous liver metastases. It is recommended that patients with primary operable colorectal cancer who are found to have synchronous liver metastases should at least have an adequate resection of the primary lesion. If the primary lesion is resectable for cure and there are solitary hepatic metastases, then excision of these seems warranted. In most cases this can be accomplished by simple excision or wedge resection, although occasional cases may require lobectomy.
Document 3 (Title: Resection of liver metastases in colorectal cancer--competitive analysis of treatment results in synchronous versus metachronous metastases.): One hundred and twenty-two patients underwent liver resection for metastases of colorectal cancer within 8 years. Seventy-four of them were treated for metachronous metastases detected in a median of 18 months after resection of the primary tumor. In another 48 patients the metastases were resected at the same time as the primary cancer. Both groups were analysed for disease-free and overall survival, and for peri-operative morbidity. However, neither the type of hepatic resection nor peri-operative morbidity showed relevant differences in the groups, except for the metachronous group, the only group in which operative mortality occurred (6.7%). Survival was not significantly different, being 32 months in the metachronous and 24 months in the synchronous groups (P = 0.051). However, disease-free survival showed significant differences; no patient in the synchronous group experienced a recurrence-free interval of more than 3 years. The median time interval until diagnosis of a recurrence was 10 months after re...
