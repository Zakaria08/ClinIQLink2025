With your own knowledge and the help of the following document:

Document 1 (Title: Animal Bites -- Treatment / Management): All wounds require extensive irrigation. Provide appropriate pain management before exploration, irrigation, or debridement of the wounds. The patient’s tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis status should be updated if necessary. For uncomplicated dog bites, the patient should be educated on the risk/benefit of closure versus healing by secondary intention and the decision made with the provider. If the patient presents delayed from the initial bite, the risks of closing the wound almost certainly outweigh the cosmetic benefits of closure. If the wound is closed, the patient should be discharged with a week’s course of amoxicillin-clavulanate.
Document 2 (Title: Treatment of common dog bites: infection risk factors.): In a retrospective study of 106 patients with complete follow-up of dog bites treated in the emergency department the following factors greatly increased the risk of infection: age greater than 50 years, delay in seeking treatment, location on an upper extremity, and puncture wounds. Debridement and irrigation decreased the incidence of infection, and sutured wounds were not more likely to become infected than those left open. Prophylactic antibiotics provided no benefit in this series. In the literature, overall infection rates varied widely according to the various patient populations. Up to 50% of infections from dog bites are caused by pasturella multocida, and the remainder by a wide range of organisms, including streptococcus. Ninety-five percent of these organisms will be sensitive to penicillin.

Special consideration should be paid to puncture wounds in areas like the hands, which have multiple small compartments. Some groups have found that as long as wounds are properly irrigated and cleansed with povidone iodine solution while a short course of antibiotics is prescribed, there is no difference in infection rates in dog bite wounds closed primarily.62Rabies in domestic animals in the United States is rare, and most cases are contracted from bat bites. In developing countries, dog bites remain the most common source of rabies. Management of this is beyond the scope of this

Question: A 27-year-old man presents to the emergency department after a dog bite. The patient was intoxicated and pulled the dog’s tail while it was eating. The dog belongs to his friend and is back at his friend’s house currently. Physical exam is notable for a dog bite on the patient’s right arm. The wound is irrigated and explored with no retained bodies found. A tetanus vaccination is administered. Which of the following is appropriate management of this patient?
Options:
A. Administer amoxicillin-clavulanic acid
B. Administer trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole
C. Close the wound with sutures and discharge the patient
D. Discharge the patient with outpatient follow up
