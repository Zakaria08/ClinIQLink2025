Document 1 (Title: [Suprasellar arachnoid cyst associated with precocious puberty: report of an operated case and review of the literature].): The pathogenesis remains unknown in the majority of patients with precocious puberty, and yet infrequently such causative cerebral lesions as hypothalamic hamartomas are associated with sexual precocity. We reported a rare case of suprasellar arachnoid cyst in an infant presenting with precocious puberty, which eventually disappeared after a cyst-peritoneal shunt. It was believed that the mass effect of the arachnoid cyst upon the hypothalamus was, at least in part, responsible for development of precocious puberty. The role of surgical decompression of the cyst was also discussed. A one-year-old girl was admitted to the hospital for evaluation of genital bleeding which had persisted on and off for two months. The height, 80cm, and the weight, 12.4kg, exceeded by far the two standard deviations from the mean level of the normal population. In addition she had the development of breast tissue as classified Tanner's Stage II, and both pubic and axillary hair. The bone age by skeletal survey of the hand was rate...
Document 2 (Title: First_Aid_Step2): Peripheral precocious puberty: Also called pseudo-precocious puberty. Results from nonhypothalamic GnRH production. Signs of estrogen excess (breast development and possibly vaginal bleeding) point to ovarian cysts or tumors. Signs of androgen excess (pubic and/or axillary hair, enlarged clitoris, acne, and/or ↑ body odor) suggest adrenal tumors or congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). First step: Obtain a radiograph of the wrist and hand to determine bone age. If bone age is within one year of chronological age, puberty has not started or has just recently begun. If bone age exceeds chronological age by > 2 years, puberty has been present for at least one year or is progressing rapidly. Next step: Conduct a GnRH agonist (leuprolide) stimulation test. Central precocious puberty: If LH response is , obtain a cranial MRI to look for CNS tumors. In girls 6–8 years of age with signs of precocious puberty, the incidence of CNS tumor is 2% in the absence of other CNS signs.
Document 3 (Title: Peripheral Precocious Puberty -- Etiology -- Ovarian tumors): Ovarian tumors such as granulosa cell tumors, Sertoli/Leydig cell tumors, Leydig cell tumors, and gonadoblastoma can all result in precocious puberty. Granulosa cell tumor is the most common sex cord tumor in girls and is associated with excess estrogen production, which can lead to isosexual precocious puberty. On the other hand, gonadoblastoma, Leydig cell tumors, and Sertoli/Leydig tumors lead to excess androgen production and can present with contrasexual precocious puberty. [3] [2]

Question: A 5-year-old girl is brought to the clinic by her mother for excessive hair growth. Her mother reports that for the past 2 months she has noticed hair at the axillary and pubic areas. She denies any family history of precocious puberty and reports that her daughter has been relatively healthy with an uncomplicated birth history. She denies any recent illnesses, weight change, fever, vaginal bleeding, pain, or medication use. Physical examination demonstrates Tanner stage 4 development. A pelvic ultrasound shows an ovarian mass. Laboratory studies demonstrates an elevated level of estrogen. What is the most likely diagnosis?
Options:
A. Granulosa cell tumor
B. Idiopathic precocious puberty
C. McCune-Albright syndrome
D. Sertoli-Leydig tumor
