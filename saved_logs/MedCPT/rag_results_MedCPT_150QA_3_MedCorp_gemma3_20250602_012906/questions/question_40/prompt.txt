Document 1 (Title: Endocrine system): Gonads The reproductive system begins development at four to five weeks of gestation with germ cell migration. The bipotential gonad results from the collection of the medioventral region of the urogenital ridge. At the five-week point, the developing gonads break away from the adrenal primordium. Gonadal differentiation begins 42 days following conception. Male gonadal development For males, the testes form at six fetal weeks and the sertoli cells begin developing by the eight week of gestation. SRY, the sex-determining locus, serves to differentiate the Sertoli cells. The Sertoli cells are the point of origin for anti-Müllerian hormone. Once synthesized, the anti-Müllerian hormone initiates the ipsilateral regression of the Müllerian tract and inhibits the development of female internal features. At 10 weeks of gestation, the Leydig cells begin to produce androgen hormones. The androgen hormone dihydrotestosterone is responsible for the development of the male external genitalia.
Document 2 (Title: Heart rate in fetuses and neonates in normal conditions and with mild depression.): The continuous recording of fetal and neonatal heart rate gives reliable information on the condition of the fetus and neonate. In the present study the results obtained in vigorous and mildly depressed newborns, by the continuous recording of fetal heart rate during labor and of neonatal heart rate during 90 minutes after birth, are presented. Twenty three pregnant women were studied during labor, as well as their newborns. They fulfilled the following conditions: --Mothers without known complications and good prenatal care. --Term pregnancies with single fetuses in vertex presentation with birthweight normal for age. --All labors started, progressed and delivered spontanously withoug signs of fetal distress. No drugs were given to the mother during labor or to the neonate. The umbilical cord was clamped immediately after birth. Seventeen neonates were vigorous at 1 and 5 minutes (Apgar score 7 or higher). Six neonates were slightly depressed at the first minute but all of them recovered at 5 minutes. Both g...
Document 3 (Title: Biochemistry_Lippinco): Choose the ONE best answer. For Questions 26.1 and 26.2, use the following scenario. A 40-year-old woman, 5 ft, 1 in (155 cm) tall and weighing 188 lb (85.5 kg), seeks your advice on how to lose weight. Her waist measured 41 in and her hips 39 in. The remainder of the physical examination and the blood laboratory data were all within the normal range. Her only child (who is age 14 years), her sister, and both of her parents are overweight. The patient recalls being overweight throughout her childhood and adolescence. Over the past 15 years, she had been on seven different diets for periods of 2 weeks to 3 months, losing from 5 to 25 lb each time. On discontinuation of the diets, she regained weight, returning to 185–190 lb. 6.1. Calculate and interpret the body mass index for the patient. Body mass index (BMI) = weight in kg/(height in m)2 = 85.5/1.552 = 35.6. Because her BMI is >30, the patient is classified as obese.

Question: A 31-year-old G2P2 female at 40 weeks gestation presents to the hospital following a rush of water that came from her vagina. She is 4 cm dilated and 80% effaced. Fetal heart tracing shows a pulse of 155/min with variable decelerations. About 12 hours after presentation, she gives birth to a 6 lb 15 oz baby boy with APGAR scores of 8 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. Which of the following structures is responsible for inhibition of female internal genitalia?
Options:
A. Spermatogonia
B. Allantois
C. Syncytiotrophoblast
D. Sertoli cells
