Tests Thyroid function tests include a battery of blood tests, including the measurement of the thyroid hormones, as well as the measurement of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). They may reveal hyperthyroidism (high T3 and T4), hypothyroidism (low T3, T4), or subclinical hyperthyroidism (normal T3 and T4 with a low TSH).",

[3] An associated improvement in laboratory derangements should also be noted, including an up-trending of free T4, which should be measured every 1 to 2 days during the initial treatment period. Low-dose intravenous liothyronine (T3) can be considered until initial improvement. [3] TSH may not reflect changes in such cases as it can take up to 4 weeks to normalize; therefore, TSH may not be helpful. Endocrinology consultation should be considered at any time.",

In women older than 60 years, the incidence of hypothyroidism may approach 6% (168). Hypothyroidism is 10 times more common in women than in men (154). Many such cases are secondary to previous antithyroid therapy (radioactive iodine or thyroidectomy) for hyperthyroidism. The most common primary cause of hypothyroidism is Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, an autoimmune condition (154). A history of lethargy, cold intolerance, lassitude, weight gain, ﬂuid retention, constipation, dry skin, hoarseness, periorbital edema, and brittle hair can be indicative of inadequate thyroid function. In this setting, physical findings of increased relaxation phase of deep tendon reﬂexes, cardiomegaly, pleural or pericardial effusions, or peripheral edema should stimulate further investigation of thyroid function by assessment of TSH and free T4 levels.
