Document 1 (Title: Case Study: 33-Year-Old Female Presents with Chronic SOB and Cough (Archived) -- Case Presentation): History of Present Illness: A 33-year-old white female presents after admission to the general medical/surgical hospital ward with a chief complaint of shortness of breath on exertion. She reports that she was seen for similar symptoms previously at her primary care physician’s office six months ago. At that time, she was diagnosed with acute bronchitis and treated with bronchodilators, empiric antibiotics, and a short course oral steroid taper. This management did not improve her symptoms, and she has gradually worsened over six months. She reports a 20-pound (9 kg) intentional weight loss over the past year. She denies camping, spelunking, or hunting activities. She denies any sick contacts. A brief review of systems is negative for fever, night sweats, palpitations, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, neural sensation changes, muscular changes, and increased bruising or bleeding. She admits a cough, shortness of breath, and shortness of breath on exertion.
Document 2 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): A 21-year-old woman comes with her parents to discuss therapeutic options for her Crohn’s disease. She was diag-nosed with Crohn’s disease 2 years ago, and it involves her terminal ileum and proximal colon, as confirmed by colonoscopy and small bowel radiography. She was initially treated with mesalamine and budesonide with good response, but over the last 2 months, she has had a relapse of her symptoms. She is experiencing fatigue, cramping, abdominal pains, and nonbloody diarrhea up to 10 times daily, and she has had a 15-lb weight loss. She has no other significant medical or surgical his-tory. Her current medications are mesalamine 2.4 g/d and budesonide 9 mg/d. She appears thin and tired. Abdominal examination reveals tenderness without guarding in the right lower quadrant; no masses are palpable. On perianal examination, there is no tenderness, fissure, or fistula. Her laboratory data are notable for anemia and elevated C-reactive protein. What are the options for immediate
Document 3 (Title: [Diffuse reduced uptake in 99m-Tc-HM-PAO SPECT and high level of neuron-specific enolase in cerebrospinal fluid in the early stage of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease].): We report an autopsy-diagnosed case of Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease (CJD) showing diffuse reduced uptake in SPECT and a high level of neuron-specific enolase (NSE) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). A 75-year-old woman with a 3-month history of progressive gait ataxia and dementia was examined. Four months after onset of the disease, she developed an akinetic mutism with normal CT and MRI. She was admitted for further examination, and electroencephalography showed periodic synchronous discharges. NSE in the CSF showed a high level at 90.6 ng/ml, and SPECT showed diffuse reduced uptake in the supratentorial region, with relatively spared uptake in the cerebellum. She died 13 months after onset of the disease, and the autopsy diagnosis was CJD. SPECT data and the level of NSE in CSF seem to be useful for clinical diagnosis and pathogenetic analysis in the early stage of CJD.

Question: A 35-year-old woman with a history of Crohn disease presents for a follow-up appointment. She says that lately, she has started to notice difficulty walking. She says that some of her friends have joked that she appears to be walking as if she was drunk. Past medical history is significant for Crohn disease diagnosed 2 years ago, managed with natalizumab for the past year because her intestinal symptoms have become severe and unresponsive to other therapies. On physical examination, there is gait and limb ataxia present. Strength is 4/5 in the right upper limb. A T1/T2 MRI of the brain is ordered and is shown. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options:
A. Sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD)
B. Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD)
C. Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE)
D. Progressive multifocal encephalopathy (PML)
