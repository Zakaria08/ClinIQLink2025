Document 1 (Title: Treatment options for the pharmacological therapy of neonatal meningitis.): Neonatal bacterial meningitis has a relatively low incidence in developed countries, but continues to cause morbidity and mortality despite advances in antimicrobial therapy. Bacterial pathogens commonly associated with neonatal meningitis include Group B streptococci, Escherichia coli K1 and other coliforms, Listeria monocytogenes and staphylococci. As it can be difficult to differentiate meningitis from septicaemia in neonates, empirical antibiotic therapy should be effective for both. Selection of an empirical antibiotic regimen should be based on: (a) bacterial prevalence and susceptibility; (b) drug characteristics; (c) postnatal age at the onset of disease; and (d) patient-specific factors. A penicillin in combination with an aminoglycoside or cefotaxime is commonly used in empirical therapies. The increased risk of staphylococcal infection in older neonates requires consideration of an antistaphylococcal antibiotic in the empirical therapy regimen. Once a causative organism has been identified, antimic...
Document 2 (Title: Nisin): Properties While in general most bacteriocins inhibit only closely related species, nisin is a rare example of a "broad-spectrum" bacteriocin effective against many Gram-positive organisms, including lactic acid bacteria (commonly associated to avoid food spoilage), Listeria monocytogenes (a known pathogen), Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium botulinum, etc. It is also particularly effective against spores. Gram-negative bacteria are protected by their outer membrane but may become susceptible to nisin action after a heat shock or when this is coupled with the chelator EDTA. When used in combination with EDTA, nisin has the ability to inhibit E. coli O157:H7 and Salmonella enterica. Nisin, as a class I bacteriocin, is very stable at acidic pHs and is more heat stable at lower pHs. The mode of action of Nisin against pathogens such as L. monocytogenes is to dissipate the membrane potential and pH gradient.
Document 3 (Title: Listeria Monocytogenes -- Treatment / Management): Since other causes of meningitis include gram-positive organisms such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and gram-negative organisms such as Neisseria meningitidis , Ceftriaxone is added as a treatment regimen . Gentamicin is utilized to mostly cover for gram-negative etiologies of meningitis such as Escherichia coli in the infant population. Finally, Vancomycin is added for Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus coverage. For broad coverage of bacterial meningitis in populations susceptible to L. monocytogenes , consider the following regimens: Less than one month old: Ampicillin plus gentamicin Adults with depressed cellular immunity or older than 50 years old: Vancomycin plus ceftriaxone plus ampicillin

Question: Select the correct statement(s) regarding Listeria monocytogenes:
Options:
1. It is a Gram-positive bacillus
2. It is a flagellated bacterium
3. It is an agent of meningitis
4. It is never pathogenic for adults
5. It is naturally resistant to aminoglycosides
