        "title": "Treatment options for the pharmacological therapy of neonatal meningitis.",
        "content": "Neonatal bacterial meningitis has a relatively low incidence in developed countries, but continues to cause morbidity and mortality despite advances in antimicrobial therapy. Bacterial pathogens commonly associated with neonatal meningitis include Group B streptococci, Escherichia coli K1 and other coliforms, Listeria monocytogenes and staphylococci. As it can be difficult to differentiate meningitis from septicaemia in neonates, empirical antibiotic therapy should be effective for both. Selection of an empirical antibiotic regimen should be based on: (a) bacterial prevalence and susceptibility; (b) drug characteristics; (c) postnatal age at the onset of disease; and (d) patient-specific factors. A penicillin in combination with an aminoglycoside or cefotaxime is commonly used in empirical therapies. The increased risk of staphylococcal infection in older neonates requires consideration of an antistaphylococcal antibiotic in the empirical therapy regimen. Once a causative organism has been identified, antimicrobial therapy should be directed towards that pathogen. Duration of therapy remains empirical, but should be at least 7 days for documented bacterial meningitis. Viral meningitis continues to have a high mortality despite the availability of antiviral agents. Adjunctive therapies may further reduce the morbidity and mortality of meningitis. While most of these therapeutic options have not been investigated in neonates, they may prove to be of benefit in the future. Anti-inflammatory agents, such as glucocorticoids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents and immunoglobulin, may modulate the inflammatory response of a meningeal infection. Other possible therapies in neonatal meningitis include cerebral blood flow modulators and disease prevention with maternal vaccines and perinatal antibiotics. Practical aspects of drug therapy such as route of administration and serum drug concentration monitoring can improve both drug therapy and patient outcome. While antibiotics have greatly improved the treatment outcome of neonatal meningitis, it is clear that additional intervention will be required to increase cure rates and reduce sequelae.",

        "title": "Nisin",
        "content": "Properties While in general most bacteriocins inhibit only closely related species, nisin is a rare example of a \"broad-spectrum\" bacteriocin effective against many Gram-positive organisms, including lactic acid bacteria (commonly associated to avoid food spoilage), Listeria monocytogenes (a known pathogen), Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium botulinum, etc. It is also particularly effective against spores. Gram-negative bacteria are protected by their outer membrane but may become susceptible to nisin action after a heat shock or when this is coupled with the chelator EDTA. When used in combination with EDTA, nisin has the ability to inhibit E. coli O157:H7 and Salmonella enterica. Nisin, as a class I bacteriocin, is very stable at acidic pHs and is more heat stable at lower pHs. The mode of action of Nisin against pathogens such as L. monocytogenes is to dissipate the membrane potential and pH gradient.",
