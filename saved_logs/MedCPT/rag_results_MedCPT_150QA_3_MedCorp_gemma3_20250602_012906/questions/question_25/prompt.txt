Document 1 (Title: Basal cell carcinoma and breast carcinoma following repeated fluoroscopic examinations of the chest.): A 69-year-old white Italian woman was first seen at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in 1981 concerning several skin growths on her back. The patient had had several basal cell carcinomas surgically removed from her back during the preceding 5 years. There was no history of arsenic ingestion or prolonged sun exposure and her family history was negative for skin cancer. The patient had developed pulmonary tuberculosis in 1938 and was treated with pneumothorax therapy. She had had more than 50 fluoroscopic examinations of the chest following this therapy, as well as multiple diagnostic x-ray films since that time. She recalled that she had faced the fluoroscopy beam during the procedure. In 1959, she had a transabdominal hysterectomy for fibroid tumors. In 1980 she underwent a right modified radical mastectomy for adenoid cystic carcinoma of the breast; biopsies of lymph nodes were negative. Physical examination revealed a thin, white woman with a right mastectomy scar. On the back, clustered in the inter...
Document 2 (Title: Case Study: 33-Year-Old Female Presents with Chronic SOB and Cough (Archived) -- Case Presentation): History of Present Illness: A 33-year-old white female presents after admission to the general medical/surgical hospital ward with a chief complaint of shortness of breath on exertion. She reports that she was seen for similar symptoms previously at her primary care physician’s office six months ago. At that time, she was diagnosed with acute bronchitis and treated with bronchodilators, empiric antibiotics, and a short course oral steroid taper. This management did not improve her symptoms, and she has gradually worsened over six months. She reports a 20-pound (9 kg) intentional weight loss over the past year. She denies camping, spelunking, or hunting activities. She denies any sick contacts. A brief review of systems is negative for fever, night sweats, palpitations, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, neural sensation changes, muscular changes, and increased bruising or bleeding. She admits a cough, shortness of breath, and shortness of breath on exertion.
Document 3 (Title: Porphyria cutanea tarda): Patients who are diagnosed with PCT typically seek treatment following the development of photosensitivities causing blisters and erosions on exposed areas of the skin. This is usually observed in the face, hands, forearms, and lower legs. Healing is slow and leaves scarring. Though blisters are the most common skin manifestations of PCT, other skin manifestations include hyperpigmentation (similar to a tan) and hypertrichosis (mainly on the cheeks) also occur. PCT is a chronic condition, with external symptoms often subsiding and recurring as a result of multiple factors. In addition to the skin lesions, chronic liver disease is very common in patients with sporadic PCT. This involves hepatic fibrosis (scarring of the liver), and inflammation. However, liver problems are less common in patients with the inherited form of the disease. Additionally, patients will often void a wine-red color urine with an increased concentration of uroporphyrin I due to their enzymatic deficiency.

Question: A 48-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of a photosensitive blistering rash on her hands, forearms, and face for 3 weeks. The lesions are not itchy. She has also noticed that her urine has been dark brown in color recently. Twenty years ago, she was successfully treated for Coats disease of the retina via retinal sclerotherapy. She is currently on hormonal replacement therapy for perimenopausal symptoms. Her aunt and sister have a history of a similar skin lesions. Examination shows multiple fluid-filled blisters and oozing erosions on the forearms, dorsal side of both hands, and forehead. There is hyperpigmented scarring and patches of bald skin along the sides of the blisters. Laboratory studies show a normal serum ferritin concentration. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management to induce remission in this patient?
Options:
A. Pursue liver transplantation
B. Begin oral thalidomide therapy
C. Begin phlebotomy therapy
D. Begin oral hydroxychloroquine therapy
