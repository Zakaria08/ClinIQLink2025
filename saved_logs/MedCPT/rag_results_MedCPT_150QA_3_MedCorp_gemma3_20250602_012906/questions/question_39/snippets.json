        "content": "Glucokinase Deficiency : Both glucokinase and hexokinase perform the same function of phosphorylating glucose to glucose-6-phosphate and trapping it in the cell. The difference between the two lies in their location and affinity to glucose. Glucokinase is present in the liver and pancreatic beta cells. Hexokinase, its isomer form, is present in tissues other than liver and pancreatic beta cells. Glucokinase has a much lower affinity for glucose than hexokinase and will function only when the glucose levels are high. After a meal, when blood glucose levels rise, glucokinase directs it toward glycogen synthesis and storage in the liver. When the glucose levels are low, hexokinase with high affinity will get to the glucose first so as to provide the glucose to cells that need it the most. Additionally, glucokinase in pancreatic beta cells acts as a glucose sensor and regulates the rate of entry of glucose into cells and into glycolysis, and therefore helps maintain the proper glucose levels in the blood. Heterozygous inactivating mutations of glucokinase result in maturity-onset diabetes of the young type 2 (MODY2 or GCK-MODY) [4] [5] . Homozygous mutations result in a complete deficiency of this enzyme and cause neonatal diabetes mellitus [6] [7] [8] .",

        "content": "1. Hexokinases I窶的II: In most tissues, glucose phosphorylation is catalyzed by one of these isozymes of hexokinase, which is one of three regulatory enzymes of glycolysis (along with phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase). They are inhibited by the reaction product glucose 6-phosphate, which accumulates when further metabolism of this hexose phosphate is reduced. Hexokinases I窶的II have a low Michaelis constant (Km) and, therefore, a high affinity (see p. 59) for glucose. This permits the efficient phosphorylation and subsequent metabolism of glucose even when tissue concentrations of glucose are low (Fig. 8.13). However, because these isozymes have a low maximal velocity ([Vmax] see p. 57) for glucose, they do not sequester (trap) cellular phosphate in the form of phosphorylated glucose or phosphorylate more glucose than the cell can use. [Note: These isozymes have broad substrate specificity and are able to phosphorylate several hexoses in addition to glucose.] 2. Hexokinase IV: In",

        "content": "Because of this cooperativity, the kinetic interaction of glucokinase with glucose does not follow classical Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Rather than a Km for glucose, it is more accurate to describe a half-saturation level S0.5, which is the concentration at which the enzyme is 50% saturated and active. The S0.5 and nH extrapolate to an \"inflection point\" of the curve describing enzyme activity as a function of glucose concentration at about 4 mmol/L. In other words, at a glucose concentration of about 72 mg/dL, which is near the low end of the normal range, glucokinase activity is most sensitive to small changes in glucose concentration.",
