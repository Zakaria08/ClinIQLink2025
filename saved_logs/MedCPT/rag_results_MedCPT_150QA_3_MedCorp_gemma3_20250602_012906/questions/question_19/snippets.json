        "content": "History of Present Illness: A 33-year-old white female presents after admission to the general medical/surgical hospital ward with a chief complaint of shortness of breath on exertion. She reports that she was seen for similar symptoms previously at her primary care physician’s office six months ago. At that time, she was diagnosed with acute bronchitis and treated with bronchodilators, empiric antibiotics, and a short course oral steroid taper. This management did not improve her symptoms, and she has gradually worsened over six months. She reports a 20-pound (9 kg) intentional weight loss over the past year. She denies camping, spelunking, or hunting activities. She denies any sick contacts. A brief review of systems is negative for fever, night sweats, palpitations, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, neural sensation changes, muscular changes, and increased bruising or bleeding. She admits a cough, shortness of breath, and shortness of breath on exertion.",

        "title": "[A case of idiopathic hypoparathyroidism complicated with chronic thyroiditis].",
        "content": "It has been suggested that autoimmunity and genetic factors may play a specific role in the development of idiopathic hypoparathyroidism. We reported a case of idiopathic hypoparathyroidism complicated with chronic thyroiditis. The patient, a woman 40 years old, visited our clinic because of tetany of both hands and dizziness. She was of short stature with a round face. She also had a goiter, hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia and decreased parathyroidal function, but renal function was normal. Her TSH level was slightly high with a positive microsome test (x 1600), and the levels of thyroid hormones tended to be low. Based on Ellsworth-Howard test findings, a diagnosis of idiopathic hypoparathyroidism was made, with the complication of chronic thyroiditis confirmed by the thyroidal biopsy. Administration of l alpha-OH-D3 normalized the level of serum calcium. No special treatment was given for the chronic thyroiditis in order to observe its natural course. Her TSH returned to normal, and the level of thyroid hormones was increased to normal ranges. Tests were positive for anti-adrenal antibody and anti-gastric antibody. The complication of chronic thyroiditis, an autoimmune disease, and a positive finding for every antibody suggested the possible involvement of autoimmunity in the mechanism of development of idiopathic hypoparathyroidism. The administration of 1 alpha-OH-D3 resulted in an increase in the serum calcium level and also normalization of levels of TSH and thyroid hormones. Thus, it is likely that the elevation of the calcium ion or immunoregulation by active vitamin D may have induced the increase in thyroid hormone secretion.",
