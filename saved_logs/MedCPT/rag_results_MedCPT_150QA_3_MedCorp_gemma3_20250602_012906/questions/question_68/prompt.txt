Document 1 (Title: Task Trainers in Procedural Skills Acquisition in Medical Simulation -- Curriculum Development): Using a task trainer can allow for the creation of a simple teaching model leading to a standardized teaching approach and, ultimately, a sustainable outcome. For many years, the standard of practice in the medical community has been Halstead's "See one, Do one, Teach one" but this has become less acceptable, particularly when invasive procedures and high-risk care are involved. [4] [5] A more efficient model for teaching procedures that combines multiple aspects of adult learning is Peyton's 4 step approach (see Figure 1). [6] In this model, a teacher can demonstrate the procedure on the task trainer to the learner with no commentary as the first step.

Document 3 (Title: [Operative surgery of the kidneys and ureters using a retroperitoneoscope].): Operative interventions on the kidneys and ureters were performed in 85 patients. In revision of the upper pole of a kidney and its median segment, the authors have used the original technique of retroperitoneoscopy (paranephroscopy) in the 11-th intercostal space. The techniques of decapsulation of a kidney, pyelo-, nephrostomy by means of the retroperitoneoscope, operative approaches to the different parts of the ureter, technique for removal of its stones are presented.
