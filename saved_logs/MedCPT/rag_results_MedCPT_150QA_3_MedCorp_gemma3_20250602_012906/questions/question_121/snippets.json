        "content": "In case of an ideal mix, the particle diffusion equation holds true and the diffusion coefficient D the speed of diffusion in the particle diffusion equation is independent of particle concentration. In other cases, resulting interactions between particles within the solvent will account for the following effects: the diffusion coefficient D in the particle diffusion equation becomes dependent of concentration. For an attractive interaction between particles, the diffusion coefficient tends to decrease as concentration increases. For a repulsive interaction between particles, the diffusion coefficient tends to increase as concentration increases. In the case of an attractive interaction between particles, particles exhibit a tendency to coalesce and form clusters if their concentration lies above a certain threshold. This is equivalent to a precipitation chemical reaction (and if the considered diffusing particles are chemical molecules in solution, then it is a precipitation).",

        "title": "The effective charge number and diffusion coefficient of cationic cytochrome c in aqueous solution.",
        "content": "The diffusion coefficient and the effective charge number of cytochrome c as a function of ionic strength, temperature and pH have been measured. The measurements were carried out using a method based on a convective diffusion process across a porous membrane. The effect of ionic strength was studied in an NaCl solution the concentration of which varied from 0.001 to 1.0 M. The temperature range studied was 10-50 degrees C, and the pH values studied were 4.0, 6.5 and 8.25. The diffusion coefficient is fairly constant as a function of ionic strength and pH, and Walden's rule is valid in the temperature range studied. The effective charge number is practically constant (ca. 2) in the concentration range studied, except in 0.001 M solution, where it is the same as the titrated value. The charge number decreases slightly in the temperature range 10-30 degrees C, but seems to drop suddenly to zero at ca. 40 degrees C. Measurements using heavy water (D2O) as a solvent instead of water did not give zero charge at 40 degrees C for cytochrome c.",

        "content": "In capillaries, diffusion of lipid-insoluble molecules is restricted to water-filled channels or pores. Movement of solute across the capillary endothelium is complex and involves corrections for attractions between solute and solvent molecules, interactions between solute molecules, pore configuration, and charge on the molecules in relation to charge on the endothelial cells. Such solute motion is not simply a matter of random thermal movement of molecules that seemingly run down a concentration gradient. For small molecules, such as water, NaCl, urea, and glucose, the capillary pores offer little restriction to diffusion (i.e., they have a low reflection coefficient; see the section “ ”). Diffusion of these substances is so rapid that the mean concentration gradient across the capillary endothelium is extremely small.
