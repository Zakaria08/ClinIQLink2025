Document 1 (Title: Expansion of a suppressor T-cell population associated with the hyper-IgM syndrome and generalized lymphadenopathy.): Immunoglobulin deficiency with increased IgM (hyper-IgM recurrent infection syndrome) is thought to be due to a defect of IgM/IgG isotype switching in B cells. Considerable genetic heterogeneity (X-linked, autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive inheritance, acquired forms) exists. We describe a case of hyper-IgM syndrome associated with massive lymphadenopathy in a 10-year-old girl with normal B-cell function. Absolute and relative increases of T-suppressor cells (CD8+) and a decrease of circulating CD4+ ("helper") cells were observed. The CD4+ cells present were all of the CD45R+ subtype, representing relatively immature ("naive") helper cells. In contrast, the number of CD4+ cells within the lymph nodes was increased. When tested fractionally, the patient's CD8+ cells selectively inhibited synthesis of IgG and IgA by normal B cells, but spared IgM. Normal allogenic T cells could induce IgG and IgA production by the patient's B cells. These findings suggest (a) a state of selective suppression of IgG and ...
Document 2 (Title: Selective IgA Deficiency -- Introduction): Immunoglobulin A (IgA) deficiency is the most common primary immunodeficiency characterized by a decreased amount of serum IgA and a concomitant lack of secretory IgA. Other immunoglobulin levels are normal. By the International Consensus definition, the diagnosis is established in individuals older than four years whose blood levels of IgA are below 7 mg/dl but have normal levels of IgG and IgM. (IgE is  normal too.) These individuals have a normal antibody response to vaccines. Nevertheless, IgA deficiency should be excluded from other causes of hypogammaglobulinemia and defects in T lymphocytes. Patients who suffer from selective IgA deficiency may have clinical symptoms, but most are largely asymptomatic. [1] [2] IgA deficiency is often associated with normal CD4 and CD8 T cells, with normal B lymphocytes in the systemic circulation. Some patients, though,  may harbor anti-IgA autoantibodies.
Document 3 (Title: Pathology_Robbins): Despite impressive advances in our understanding and treatment of HIV infection, the long-term prognosis of patients with AIDS remains a concern. Although with effective drug therapy the mortality rate has declined in the United States, the treated patients still carry viral DNA in their lymphoid tissues. Truly curative therapy remains elusive. Similarly, although considerable effort has been mounted to develop a protective vaccine, many hurdles remain before this becomes a reality. Molecular analyses have revealed an alarming degree of variation in viral isolates from patients; this renders the task of producing a vaccine extremely difficult. Recent efforts have focused on producing broadly neutralizing antibodies against relatively invariant portions of HIV proteins. At present, therefore, prevention, public health measures, and anti-retroviral drugs remain the mainstays in the fight against AIDS. Progression of disease. HIVinfectionprogressesthroughphases.

Question: A 6-year-old male who recently immigrated to the United States from Asia is admitted to the hospital with dyspnea. Physical exam reveals a gray pseudomembrane in the patient's oropharynx along with lymphadenopathy. The patient develops myocarditis and expires on hospital day 5. Which of the following would have prevented this patient's presentation and decline?
Options:
A. Increased CD4+ T cell count
B. Secretory IgA against viral proteins
C. Increased IgM preventing bacterial invasion
D. Circulating IgG against AB exotoxin
