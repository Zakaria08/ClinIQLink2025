        "content": "Introduction to Autonomic Pharmacology Bertram G. Katzung, MD, PhD A 56-year-old woman is brought to the university eye center with a complaint of “loss of vision.” Because of visual impair-ment, she has lost her driver’s license and has fallen several times in her home. Examination reveals that her eyelids close involuntarily with a frequency and duration sufficient to pre-vent her from seeing her surroundings for more than brief moments at a time. When she holds her eyelids open with her fingers, she can see normally. She has no other muscle dysfunction. A diagnosis of blepharospasm is made. Using a fine needle, several injections of botulinum toxin type A are made in the orbicularis oculi muscle of each eyelid. After observation in the waiting area, she is sent home. Two days later, she reports by telephone that her vision has improved dramatically. How did botulinum toxin improve her vision? How long can her vision be expected to remain normal after this single treatment?",

        "title": "[MRI findings of brain-stem tuberculoma in a case of tuberculous meningitis].",
        "content": "A 54-year-old woman developed headache and slight fever. When she consulted a physician, she could not move either of her eyes to the right. Cranial CT scan revealed no significant findings. Lumbar puncture was performed and CSF examination showed the cell count of 10,304/mm3, glucose level of 10 mg/dl, and total protein value of 270 mg/dl. Her symptoms and laboratory findings suggested meningitis and she was admitted to our hospital. Neurological examination revealed bilateral dilated pupils with sluggish light reflex, right gaze palsy, and hypesthesia of the left side of her face. A diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis was established by a positive test for acid-fast bacillus in CSF, and anti-tuberculous therapy was started at once. One month after the onset of symptoms, her main complaints were double vision and cerebellar ataxia. Both CT and MRI revealed a right brain-stem lesion. Pre-contrast CT could not clearly visualize the lesion but with contrast medium a homogeneously-enhanced circular lesion was shown. MRI on T2WI demonstrated the right brain-stem lesion to have a central bright core with hypointense periphery, which in turn was surrounded by hyperintensity. The lesion appeared isointense with cerebral white matter and the \"central bright core\" area was demonstrated to be slightly hypointense on T1WI. On post-contrast T1WI (with Gd-DTPA), the lesion showed strong homogeneous enhancement. The CT and MRI findings indicated a brain-stem tuberculoma, which was regarded as the cause of the ocular movement paralysis and cerebellar ataxia. As the clinical symptoms gradually resolved with anti-tuberculous treatment, the MRI appearance of the lesion also improved.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "content": "History of Present Illness: A 33-year-old white female presents after admission to the general medical/surgical hospital ward with a chief complaint of shortness of breath on exertion. She reports that she was seen for similar symptoms previously at her primary care physician’s office six months ago. At that time, she was diagnosed with acute bronchitis and treated with bronchodilators, empiric antibiotics, and a short course oral steroid taper. This management did not improve her symptoms, and she has gradually worsened over six months. She reports a 20-pound (9 kg) intentional weight loss over the past year. She denies camping, spelunking, or hunting activities. She denies any sick contacts. A brief review of systems is negative for fever, night sweats, palpitations, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, neural sensation changes, muscular changes, and increased bruising or bleeding. She admits a cough, shortness of breath, and shortness of breath on exertion.",
