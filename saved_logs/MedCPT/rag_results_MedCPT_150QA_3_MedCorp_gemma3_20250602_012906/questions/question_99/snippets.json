        "title": "Postmenopausal Syndrome -- Treatment / Management -- Sexual Dysfunction",
        "content": "Sexual dysfunction is multifactorial. Treating hot flashes, vaginal dryness, and mood changes have been found to improve sexual dysfunction. Some of the symptoms, especially post-surgical menopause, are attributed to a decreased level of androgen. Low-dose vaginal estrogen and DHEA can be used in dyspareunia. Several randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials suggest that testosterone therapy improves sexual function like desire and frequency in postmenopausal women. The potential benefit and harm and the limited data on long-term use need to be discussed. Also, all safer options like relationship intervention, sex therapy sessions, optimizing treatment of depression, and treatment of another postmenopausal problem should be done before the trial of testosterone therapy. Transdermal and oral preparations are preferred in women.",

        "title": "Sexual desire",
        "content": "Hormones Sexual desire is said to be influenced by androgens in men and by both androgens and estrogens in women. Many studies associate the sex hormone testosterone with sexual desire. Another hormone thought to influence sexual desire is oxytocin. Exogenous administration of moderate amounts of oxytocin has been found to stimulate females to desire and seek out sexual activity. In women, oxytocin levels are at their highest during sexual activity. In males, the frequency of ejaculation affects libido. If roughly a week passes between ejaculations, there will be a stronger desire for sexual activity. Interventions Medical interventions are available for individuals who feel sexually bored, experience performance anxiety, or are unable to orgasm. For everyday life, a 2013 fact sheet from the Association for Reproductive Health Professionals recommends erotic literature and recalling instances when one felt sexy and sexual. Social and religious views",

        "title": "Low sexual desire in women: the role of reproductive hormones.",
        "content": "The role of reproductive hormones in mediating sexual desire in healthy women is still unclear. Elucidation was sought in this study by comparing the hormonal milieu of two groups of subjects with markedly different levels of sexual desire. Seventeen women ages 27-39 who met DSM III-R criteria for severe, persistent, and generalized loss of desire (hypoactive sexual desire disorder, HSD), but had no other current psychological or medical problem, were compared to 13 healthy, sexually active women. All subjects and spouses were interviewed extensively to determine the women's sexual desire and responsiveness. Blood samples were drawn every 3 to 4 days for one menstrual cycle and were analyzed by RIA for testosterone, SHBG, estradiol, progesterone, prolactin, and luteinizing hormone. Results indicated that the HSD women's gonadal hormones fluctuated normally over the menstrual cycle, were within normal limits for each cycle phase, and were never significantly different from those of controls. Neither testosterone, non-SHBG bound testosterone, nor prolactin differentiated between the HSD women with the most and least severe HSD parameters (e.g., frequency of fantasy, masturbation, or female-initiated coitus), nor between women with lifelong and acquired HSD. The present findings did not provide evidence that reproductive hormones are important determinants of individual differences in the sexual desire of these eugonadal women.",
