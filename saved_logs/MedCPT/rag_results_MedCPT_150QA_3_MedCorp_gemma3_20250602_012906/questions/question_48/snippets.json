        "content": "Thyroglossal-duct cysts usually present as an anterior midline neck mass, ranking first in this location in the pediatric age. We have carried out a retrospective revision of 52 pediatric patients with a preoperative diagnosis of thyroglossal-duct cyst. All of them were treated in our surgical unit between 1982 and 1989. The male to female ratio of cases was 34:18 with symptoms appearing at an average age of 4 years. The most frequent clinical presentation was that of a cystic mass without any inflammatory signs (65%), located in the mid-line at the hyoid level (75%). In this paper we analyze the existing possibilities as regards to the clinical presentation, location and characteristics of this type of cervical swellings, as well as the most frequent causes of misdiagnosis. We also make a comparison between the results we have obtained with the different surgical techniques used. We conclude that it is necessary to perform a radical surgical treatment of the thyroglossal-duct remnants, which includes removal of the middle third of the hyoid bone and excision of the thyroglossal duct as far as the foramen cecum.",

        "content": "Three-fourths of abnormalities within a persistent thyroglossal duct involve the formation of a cyst. If a persistent thyroglossal duct becomes fluid filled it will form a thyroglossal duct cyst, which accounts for 70% of congenital neck masses and is the most likely diagnosis if the mass is along the midline of the neck. These cysts are often diagnosed in children under the age of ten and have no particular gender prevalence. The cysts are normally asymptomatic at this age and are noticed because of the swelling that will move if the patient swallows. Over 80% of these cysts are located at or below the hyoid bone.",
