        "content": "A 42-year-old primigravida woman at 34 weeks gestation was brought to the obstetric emergency department at midnight with complaints of severe headache, blurry vision, and right upper quadrant pain for the last 5 to 6 hours. She noted lower extremity edema and facial swelling that was gradually increasing. She has gestational hypertension and, 1 week ago, was prescribed labetalol 200 mg twice a day. On initial presentation, her blood pressure was 190/110 mm Hg on 2 separate occasions, 5 minutes apart. She had gained 2 kilograms since her last antenatal checkup in the clinic a week ago. The patient was diagnosed with severe preeclampsia. The senior obstetric resident ordered a loading dose of magnesium sulfate to prevent imminent seizure. The hospital protocol used an intravenous (IV) and intramuscular (IM) regimen where the patient received a 4 g IV bolus and a 10 g IM dose administered as 5 g in each buttock. The senior resident gave verbal orders for magnesium sulfate administration to the junior resident, who verbally communicated the order to the nurse.",

        "content": "Patient Presentation: BE is a 45-year-old woman who presents with concerns about sudden (paroxysmal), intense, brief episodes of headache, sweating (diaphoresis), and a racing heart (palpitations). Focused History: BE reports that the attacks started ~3 weeks ago. They last from 2 to 10 minutes, during which time she feels quite anxious. During the attacks, it feels as though her heart is skipping beats (arrhythmia). At first, she thought the attacks were related to recent stress at work and maybe even menopause. The last time it happened, she was in a pharmacy and had her blood pressure taken. She was told it was 165/110 mm Hg. BE notes that she has lost weight (~8 lbs) in this period even though her appetite has been good.",

        "content": "A 37-year-old, gravida 5 with 41 weeks of gestation was admitted because of slight vaginal bleeding, abdominal pain, and absence of fetal movements for a few days. Previously she had been admitted to a provincial hospital with sudden severe abdominal pain and fainting at the second month of her pregnancy and ectopic pregnancy was suspected. She was discharged the following morning, after all signs and symptoms had completely disappeared without any special investigation. On her last admission all clinical examinations were normal but fetal heart sound was absent. The cervix was closed and uneffaced. Abdominal X-ray showed signs of fetal death. Sonography confirmed a dead fetus in utero but with placenta previa totalis. A laparotomy was performed. A macerated female fetus, weighting 3,800 g was found in the amniotic sac lying in the abdominal cavity. The placenta was attached to the dorsal surface of her abdomen close to the large intestine and the omentum; the entire placenta was untouched and left in the peritoneal cavity. There were no postoperative complications. She recovered well and was discharged after 7 days.",
