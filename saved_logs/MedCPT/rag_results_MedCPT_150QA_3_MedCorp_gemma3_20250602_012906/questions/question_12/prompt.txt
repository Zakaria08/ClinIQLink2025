Document 1 (Title: Case Study: 32-Year-Old Male Presenting with Right Lower Quadrant Abdominal Pain (Archived) -- Case Presentation): He describes the pain as coming on suddenly and sharp in nature.   Since the onset, his pain started to improve until the morning of his presentation to the emergency department, when it acutely worsened. He says that the pain is much worse with movement.
Document 2 (Title: [A case of hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy of neuronal type with retardation of motor development].): An atypical case of hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy of neuronal type with retardation of motor development was described. The patient was a 15-year-old boy who had suffered from distal muscle weakness with atrophy of four limbs and deformities of hands and feet since age 6 months. These symptoms were slowly progressive. He had never walked. His parents were not consanguinous. His parents and two siblings were unremarkable on neurological examination and on nerve conduction studies. On neurological examination, he showed severe degree of muscle weakness and atrophy in the distal upper and lower limbs, moderate degree of muscle weakness and atrophy in the proximal upper limbs and slight degree of made weakness and atrophy in the proximal upper limbs. Deep tendon reflexes in four limbs were decreased or absent. Vibration sensation was moderately decreased in the distal parts of four limbs. On the nerve conduction studies, no sensory nerve potential was recorded in the median, ulnar and sural nerves bilat...
Document 3 (Title: Neuromuscular junction): Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) is an autoimmune disorder that affects the presynaptic portion of the neuromuscular junction. This rare disease can be marked by a unique triad of symptoms: proximal muscle weakness, autonomic dysfunction, and areflexia. Proximal muscle weakness is a product of pathogenic autoantibodies directed against P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channels, which in turn leads to a reduction of acetylcholine release from motor nerve terminals on the presynaptic cell. Examples of autonomic dysfunction caused by LEMS include erectile dysfunction in men, constipation, and, most commonly, dry mouth. Less common dysfunctions include dry eyes and altered perspiration. Areflexia is a condition in which tendon reflexes are reduced and it may subside temporarily after a period of exercise.

Question: A 1-year-old boy presents to the emergency department with weakness and a change in his behavior. His parents state that they first noticed the change in his behavior this morning and it has been getting worse. They noticed the patient was initially weak in his upper body and arms, but now he won’t move his legs with as much strength or vigor as he used to. Physical exam is notable for bilateral ptosis with a sluggish pupillary response, a very weak sucking and gag reflex, and shallow respirations. The patient is currently drooling and his diaper is dry. The parents state he has not had a bowel movement in over 1 day. Which of the following is the pathophysiology of this patient’s condition?
Options:
A. Autoantibodies against the presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels
B. Autoimmune demyelination of peripheral nerves
C. Blockade of presynaptic acetylcholine release at the neuromuscular junction
D. Lower motor neuron destruction in the anterior horn
