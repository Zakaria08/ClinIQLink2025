        "content": "Acute hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis, and shock liver will all have very significantly elevated transaminases, typically in the thousands. This is much high than the levels seen in fascioliasis which are usually in the hundreds. Toxocariasis, acute schistosomiasis, ascariasis, and strongyloidiasis, are all nearly indistinguishable from fascioliasis in the acute phase, especially in the presence of peripheral eosinophilia and pulmonary symptoms. Serologic testing is required to rule these out.",

The prevalence of Isospora belli is between 5 and 19% and that of strongyloidiasis between 2 and 5%, depending on the authors. These parasitic infections are probably one of the frequent causes of chronic diarrhea in Africa. The prevalence of toxoplasmosis and pneumocystosis are not well known.
