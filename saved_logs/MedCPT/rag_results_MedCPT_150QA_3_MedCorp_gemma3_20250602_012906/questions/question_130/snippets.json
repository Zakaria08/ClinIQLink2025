        "content": "Enzymes do not alter or shift the equilibrium of a given reaction but instead affect the free energy required to initiate a conversion, which affects the reaction rate. The energy hump that must be surmounted for a reaction to progress is called the activation energy; this is the highest energy on a reaction diagram. It is the most unstable conformation of the substrate in the reaction. Enzymes generally do not add energy to the reaction but instead lower the transition state energy to require less activation energy.",

A chemical reaction is able to manufacture a high-energy transition state molecule more readily when there is a stabilizing fit within the active site of a catalyst. The binding energy of a reaction is this energy released when favorable interactions between substrate and catalyst occur. The binding energy released assists in achieving the unstable transition state. Reactions otherwise without catalysts need a higher input of energy to achieve the transition state. Non-catalyzed reactions do not have free energy available from active site stabilizing interactions, such as catalytic enzyme reactions.",

        "content": "The most important proteins in the body are those that help with reactions. These are called enzymes; their main job is to help the body generate energy. Reactions are always possible but not favorable. Approximately 90% of the reactions that occur in the body would not operate at the appropriate speed required for life. Enzymes, therefore, act as \"catalysts.\" Approximately 80% of reactions in the body would not occur without an enzyme to catalyze the reaction. Enzymes make reactions more probable by making them easier to occur. They bring substrates together in space and time. Enzymes lower the free energy of activation, which translates to less energy needed for a reaction to occur. Enzymes also stabilize the high-energy substrate intermediate within a reaction and are not consumed in the reaction. An enzyme can be classified as globular if it's a highly folded polypeptide that often exhibits a spherical shape and is stabilized by weak chemical interactions. [8] Sources",
