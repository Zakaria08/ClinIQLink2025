Ubiquitin is the most common of these, and usually signals that the ubiquitin-tagged protein should be degraded. Most of the polypeptide modifications listed above occur post-translationally, i.e., after the protein has been synthesized on the ribosome, typically occurring in the endoplasmic reticulum, a subcellular organelle of the eukaryotic cell. Many other chemical reactions (e.g., cyanylation) have been applied to proteins by chemists, although they are not found in biological systems.",

As indicated, translation of an mRNA sequence into an amino acid sequence on the ribosome is not the end of the process of forming a protein. To function, the completed polypeptide chain must fold correctly into its three-dimensional conformation, bind any cofactors required, and assemble with its partner protein chains, if any. Noncovalent bond formation drives these changes. As indicated, many proteins also require covalent modifications of selected amino acids. Although the most frequent modifications are protein glycosylation and protein phosphorylation, over 200 different types of covalent modifications are known (see pp. 165–166).",

Numerous antibiotics interfere with the process of protein synthesis. Many polypeptide chains are covalently modified during or after translation. Such modifications include amino acid removal; phosphorylation, which may activate or inactivate the protein; glycosylation, which plays a role in protein targeting; and hydroxylation such as that seen in collagen. Protein targeting can be either cotranslational (as with secreted proteins) or posttranslational (as with mitochondrial matrix proteins). Proteins must fold to achieve their functional form. Folding can be spontaneous or facilitated by chaperones.
