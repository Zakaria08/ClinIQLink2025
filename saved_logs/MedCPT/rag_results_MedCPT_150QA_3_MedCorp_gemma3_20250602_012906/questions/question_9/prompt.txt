Document 1 (Title: Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation -- Treatment / Management -- Rate Control): Rate control is the preferred strategy for all asymptomatic AF patients. Guidelines on target heart rate in patients selected for rate control are lacking. A previously conducted randomized trial (RACE II) to assess heart rate goal in patients with AF showed no outcome difference between lenient and strict heart rate control; however, sufficient evidence to assess the impact on all-cause mortality was lacking. Physicians usually attempt to control heart rate control with agents such as beta-blockers (metoprolol, esmolol, propranolol), nondihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers (verapamil, diltiazem), or digoxin. All 3 classes of drugs are given intravenously (IV) for acute rate control and can be switched to oral therapy for chronic management. In patients with chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, carvedilol therapy has shown significant improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction. Due to the negative inotropic properties of calcium channel blockers, physicians do not use these not pre...
Document 2 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): A 69-year-old retired teacher presents with a 1-month history of palpitations, intermittent shortness of breath, and fatigue. She has a history of hypertension. An electrocardiogram (ECG) shows atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response of 122 beats/min (bpm) and signs of left ventricular hypertrophy. She is anticoagulated with warfarin and started on sustained-release metoprolol, 50 mg/d. After 7 days, her rhythm reverts to normal sinus rhythm spontaneously. However, over the ensuing month, she continues to have intermittent palpita-tions and fatigue. Continuous ECG recording over a 48-hour period documents paroxysms of atrial fibrillation with heart rates of 88–114 bpm. An echocardiogram shows a left ven-tricular ejection fraction of 38% (normal ≥ 60%) with no localized wall motion abnormality. At this stage, would you initiate treatment with an antiarrhythmic drug to maintain normal sinus rhythm, and if so, what drug would you choose?
Document 3 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): Irbesartan Generic,Avapro Treatment of Angina Pectoris Bertram G. Katzung, MD, PhD* A 56-year-old woman presents in the office with a history of recent-onset chest discomfort when jogging or swimming vigorously. The pain is dull but poorly localized; it disap-pears after 5–10 minutes of rest. She has never smoked but has a history of hyperlipidemia (total cholesterol level of 245 mg/dL and low-density lipoprotein [LDL] of 160 mg/dL recorded 1 year ago) and admits that she has not been fol-lowing the recommended diet. Her father survived a “heart attack” at age 55, and an uncle died of some cardiac disease at age 60. On physical examination, the patient’s blood pressure is 145/90 mm Hg, and her heart rate is 80 bpm. She is in no acute distress, and there are no other significant physical findings; an electrocardiogram is normal except for slight left ventricular hypertrophy. Assuming that a diagno-sis of stable effort angina is correct, what medical treatment should be implemented?

Question: A 62-year-old woman presents for a regular check-up. She complains of lightheadedness and palpitations which occur episodically. Past medical history is significant for a myocardial infarction 6 months ago and NYHA class II chronic heart failure. She also was diagnosed with grade I arterial hypertension 4 years ago. Current medications are aspirin 81 mg, atorvastatin 10 mg, enalapril 10 mg, and metoprolol 200 mg daily. Her vital signs are a blood pressure of 135/90 mm Hg, a heart rate of 125/min, a respiratory rate of 14/min, and a temperature of 36.5°C (97.7°F). Cardiopulmonary examination is significant for irregular heart rhythm and decreased S1 intensity. ECG is obtained and is shown in the picture (see image). Echocardiography shows a left ventricular ejection fraction of 39%. Which of the following drugs is the best choice for rate control in this patient?
Options:
A. Atenolol
B. Diltiazem
C. Propafenone
D. Digoxin
