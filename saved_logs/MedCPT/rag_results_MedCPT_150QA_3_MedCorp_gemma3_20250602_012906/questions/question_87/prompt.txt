Document 1 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): radiographic imaging with CT scan, positron emission tomography (PET), or preferably CT-PET. PET scanning attempts to identify sites of malignancy based on glucose metabolism by measuring the uptake of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). Rapidly dividing cells, presumably in the lung tumors, will preferentially take up 18F-FDG and appear as a “hot spot.” To date, PET has been mostly used for staging and detection of metastases in lung cancer and in the detection of nodules >15 mm in diameter. Combined 18F-FDG PET-CT imaging has been shown to improve the accuracy of staging in NSCLC compared to visual correlation of PET and CT or either study alone. CT-PET has been found to be superior in identifying pathologically enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes and extrathoracic metastases. A standardized uptake value (SUV) of >2.5 on PET is highly suspicious for malignancy. False negatives can be seen in diabetes, in lesions <8 mm, and in slow-growing tumors (e.g., carcinoid tumors or well-differentiated
Document 2 (Title: Fluorodeoxyglucose (18F)): Since its development in 1976, 18F-FDG had a profound influence on research in the neurosciences. The subsequent discovery in 1980 that 18F-FDG accumulates in tumors underpins the evolution of PET as a major clinical tool in cancer diagnosis. 18F-FDG is now the standard radiotracer used for PET neuroimaging and cancer patient management. The images can be assessed by a nuclear medicine physician or radiologist to provide diagnoses of various medical conditions.
Document 3 (Title: Assessment of response to cancer therapy using fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose and positron emission tomography.): In order to evaluate the usefulness of 18F-FDG PET in the assessment of therapeutic effects, FDG-PET studies were performed both before and after therapy in 26 patients with miscellaneous malignant tumors. The change in FDG uptake by therapy was compared with the change in tumor size and prognosis. All 26 lesions had a high FDG uptake before therapy. Five of seven lesions which had a relatively low FDG uptake before therapy showed no change or increase in tumor size by therapy. The decreased FDG uptake after therapy was more prominent in the partial response group than in the no change group. FDG uptake before therapy in the non-relapse group was higher than that in the relapse group. However, a decreased FDG uptake did not necessarily indicate a good prognosis. One patient with no change in tumor size and a decreased FDG uptake had no recurrence. This suggests that FDG-PET has a complementary role in the assessment of therapeutic effects.
