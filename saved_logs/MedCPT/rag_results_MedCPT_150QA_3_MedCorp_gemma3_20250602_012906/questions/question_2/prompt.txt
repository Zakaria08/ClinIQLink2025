Document 1 (Title: Can the fall in Avon's sudden infant death rate be explained by changes in sleeping position?): To examine the impact of changing practice with regard to infant sleeping position on mortality from the sudden infant death syndrome. A population based study of all infants dying suddenly and unexpectedly during February 1990 to July 1991, and two groups of controls; one comprising every 125th baby born to Avon residents and the other comprising pairs of infants matched to each index case for age, neighbourhood, and date of study. Information about sleeping position was collected at home visits soon after the index baby's death or, for the population based controls, on several occasions in the first six months of life. The design was comparable to that of an earlier study of the same population. County of Avon. 35 infants who died suddenly and unexpectedly (32 of the sudden infant death syndrome), 70 matched controls, and 152 population based controls. The prevalence of prone sleeping in the matched controls was much lower than that found in an earlier study in Avon (28% (18/64) 1990-1 v 58% (76/131) 1987-9...
Document 2 (Title: Pediatrics_Nelson): A variety of unproven mechanisms have been proposed to explain SIDS. SIDS is associated with prone position during sleep, especially on soft bedding. The widely advocated supine sleeping position explains, in part, the decreased incidence of SIDS during the past two decades. Current theories for a predisposition to SIDS include cellular brainstem abnormalities and maturational delay related to neural or cardiorespiratory control. A portion of SIDS deaths may be due to prolongation of the Q-T interval, abnormal CNS control of respiration, and CO2 rebreathing from sleeping face down (especially in softbedding). See Table 134-1 for the differential diagnosis of SIDS. There has been a significant decline in SIDS with the backto-sleep program and avoiding soft bedding. Thus, all parents should be instructed to place their infants in the supine position unless there are medical contraindications. All soft Fulminant infection*,† Infant botulism*
Document 3 (Title: [Crib death, sleeping position and temperature].): Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is the commonest cause of death in children over one week of age. Norway has the highest incidence in Scandinavia and the figure has increased during the last 20 years. There has been much discussion as to whether sleeping in the prone position rather than in the supine or lateral position may be a predisposing factor to cot death. In all 14 studies in seven countries where the question has been investigated, there was a higher proportion of prone infants in the SIDS group than in the control group. Intervention studies have shown that reducing the proportion of infants sleeping prone was followed by a reduction in cot deaths. There is also evidence that overheating is a risk factor for SIDS. In one British study it was found that infants who died of SIDS had more clothes on, and blankets covering them, and that both prone position and overheating were independently associated with SIDS. A possible mechanism is that overheating interferes with respiratory control. Although ...

Question: A 3-month-old baby died suddenly at night while asleep. His mother noticed that he had died only after she awoke in the morning. No cause of death was determined based on the autopsy. Which of the following precautions could have prevented the death of the baby?

B. Keeping the infant covered and maintaining a high room temperature
C. Application of a device to maintain the sleeping position
D. Avoiding pacifier use during sleep
