        "content": "History of Present Illness: A 33-year-old white female presents after admission to the general medical/surgical hospital ward with a chief complaint of shortness of breath on exertion. She reports that she was seen for similar symptoms previously at her primary care physician’s office six months ago. At that time, she was diagnosed with acute bronchitis and treated with bronchodilators, empiric antibiotics, and a short course oral steroid taper. This management did not improve her symptoms, and she has gradually worsened over six months. She reports a 20-pound (9 kg) intentional weight loss over the past year. She denies camping, spelunking, or hunting activities. She denies any sick contacts. A brief review of systems is negative for fever, night sweats, palpitations, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, neural sensation changes, muscular changes, and increased bruising or bleeding. She admits a cough, shortness of breath, and shortness of breath on exertion.",

        "content": "Introduction to Autonomic Pharmacology Bertram G. Katzung, MD, PhD A 56-year-old woman is brought to the university eye center with a complaint of “loss of vision.” Because of visual impair-ment, she has lost her driver’s license and has fallen several times in her home. Examination reveals that her eyelids close involuntarily with a frequency and duration sufficient to pre-vent her from seeing her surroundings for more than brief moments at a time. When she holds her eyelids open with her fingers, she can see normally. She has no other muscle dysfunction. A diagnosis of blepharospasm is made. Using a fine needle, several injections of botulinum toxin type A are made in the orbicularis oculi muscle of each eyelid. After observation in the waiting area, she is sent home. Two days later, she reports by telephone that her vision has improved dramatically. How did botulinum toxin improve her vision? How long can her vision be expected to remain normal after this single treatment?",

        "title": "[Reducing body myopathy--a case report].",
        "content": "A 2-year-old girl with reducing body myopathy was reported. She had no family history of neuromuscular disease. She developed normally with no delay in milestones during infancy. She had no muscle weakness or hypotonia up to 2 years of age when she received mumps vaccination. Three days after the injection, she was first noticed to have limb muscle weakness. The muscle weakness progressed rapidly with increasing difficulty in gait and raising the upper arms, particularly the left. Four months later, she had difficulty in keeping her head up and could no longer climb the stairs. On physical examination, she had proximal dominant generalized muscle weakness, with a preferential neck muscle involvement. She walked waddlingly and stood up with Gowers' maneuver. Facial and ocular muscles were intact. No dysarthria, dysphagia or respiratory difficulty was noted. EMG showed myopathic pattern. Serum creatine kinase level was moderately elevated to 739 IU/l. In the biopsied left biceps muscle, there was marked variation in fiber size, but no apparent necrotic or regenerating fibers. The most striking feature was the presence of numerous eosinophilic inclusions which reduced nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) and were, therefore, stained dark with menadione-linked alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase even without the substrate of menadione, showing the histochemical characteristics of \"reducing\" body. The bodies were predominantly seen in fibers with disorganized intermyofibrillar networks and with high acid phosphatase activity. On electron microscopy, the reducing bodies consisted of fine granular material with the similar electron density to the chromatin granules and were located mostly around the degenerated nuclei, suggesting the nuclear degeneration playing a role in forming the reducing bodies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
