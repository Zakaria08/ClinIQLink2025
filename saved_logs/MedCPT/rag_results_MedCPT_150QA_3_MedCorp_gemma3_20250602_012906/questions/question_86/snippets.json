        "content": "Other than dust mites, house dust allergy can be caused by the following allergen sources: Mold. The fungus grows in a humid environment like house basements, kitchens, gardens, and bathrooms. The spores of the mold become airborne, which on inhalation leads to allergic rhinitis. Cockroaches. These are found in a variety of environments. The saliva, fecal matter, and shed off parts of cockroaches serve as potential allergens for triggering allergies. Around 68 percent of households in the USA are known to have cockroach allergens. The percentage increases further in urban areas. Pollen. Flowers, grass, weeds, and trees are sources of pollens that constitute an essential component of household dust. These are a common cause for triggering allergic reactions. Pets. Fur, feathers, animal hair, dander, saliva, and fecal matter all serve as allergens. [31] Dust mite allergy can be confused with non-allergic forms of rhinitis. [32] These include the following:",
