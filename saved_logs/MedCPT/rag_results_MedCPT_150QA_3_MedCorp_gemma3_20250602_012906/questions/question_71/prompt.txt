Document 1 (Title: [A clinical score system for children with ARDS].): In a retrospective study we developed a simple acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) scoring system in order to analyze the severity of ARDS as precisely as possible. From March 1983 to May 1990, 17 children with ARDS were admitted and treated at the pediatric intensive care unit of the University Hospital of Graz. The ARDS score was evaluated as a predictor of outcome. The score is based on four variables: mean airway pressure, oxygenation index, additional number of organ system failure and a radiological score, each of which was assigned a score between 0 and 3 (Table 3). The score was recorded on admission or immediately after respiratory failure and after 24, 48 and 72 h. The patients were divided into survivors and non-survivors. After 24 h of mechanical ventilation the ARDS score was 7.16 +/- 0.79 in survivors and 10.4 +/- 0.4 points in non-survivors (P less than 0.0006). Similar differences were found after 48 and 72 h of therapy. In addition, the predictive power of the ARDS score after 24 h was...
Document 2 (Title: Neonatal MIS-C -- Introduction): World Health Organization declared a COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. SARS-CoV-2 causes COVID-19 infection. It presents as acute respiratory distress syndrome and infects all age groups. In adults, COVID-19 causes acute respiratory failure. In children, COVID-19 usually has a milder clinical course and more favorable outcome than in adults. In contrast to adults and older children, covid-19 infection is uncommon in neonates. [1]
Document 3 (Title: Acute respiratory distress syndrome): The primary treatment involves mechanical ventilation together with treatments directed at the underlying cause. Ventilation strategies include using low volumes and low pressures. If oxygenation remains insufficient, lung recruitment maneuvers and neuromuscular blockers may be used. If these are insufficient, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) may be an option. The syndrome is associated with a death rate between 35 and 50%. Globally, ARDS affects more than 3 million people a year. The condition was first described in 1967. Although the terminology of "adult respiratory distress syndrome" has at times been used to differentiate ARDS from "infant respiratory distress syndrome" in newborns, the international consensus is that "acute respiratory distress syndrome" is the best term because ARDS can affect people of all ages. There are separate diagnostic criteria for children and those in areas of the world with fewer resources.
