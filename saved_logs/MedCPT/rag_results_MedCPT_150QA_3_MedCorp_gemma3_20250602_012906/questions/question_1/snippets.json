        "title": "[A case of miliary tuberculosis associated with acute respiratory failure during pregnancy].",
        "content": "A case of miliary tuberculosis associated with acute respiratory failure during pregnancy was reported. A 39-year-old, 29-week pregnant woman was admitted to our hospital with complaints of nonproductive cough and fever on June 12. On admission, her temperature was 38.2 degrees C; pulse rate was 90/min., and blood pressure was 120/76 mmHg. Physical examination revealed moist rales at right lung basis. Chest X-ray showed small nodular infiltrates in right lower lung field. Laboratory data revealed positive CRP, accelerated ESR and increased level of alpha 2-globulin. The number of T-cells was markedly decreased (14/mm3). The PPD skin test was negative, and the sputum smears for acid-fast bacilli were negative. Suspected of bacterial or viral pneumonia, the patient was treated with antibiotics (CPM, EM and CAZ), which had no effects for her. On June 16, the Chest X-ray showed infiltrates throughout bilateral lung fields, and the patient became increasingly dyspneic. On June 18, the results of arterial blood gas, analysis under room air were: PaO2 26.7 Torr, PaCO2 29.0 Torr, pH 7.505. Because of severe hypoxemia, she was intubated and placed on a volume-cycled respirator. Hydrocortisone (1000 mg, daily) was added to treatment because ARDS was suspected. Since the smears of tracheobronchial secretions showed acid-fast bacilli on June 24, she was diagnosed to have miliary tuberculosis. Then the intensive therapy with antituberculosis drugs (isoniazid 400 mg, rifampicin 450 mg, and streptomycin 1g, daily) was started. The non specific antibiotics were discontinued; hydrocortisone was tapered and stopped. The next week, she became afebrile and hypoxemia steadily improved.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "title": "Pre-eclampsia",
        "content": "Immune factors may also play a role. Diagnosis Testing for pre-eclampsia is recommended throughout pregnancy via measuring a woman's blood pressure. Diagnostic criteria Pre-eclampsia is diagnosed when a pregnant woman develops: Blood pressure ≥140 mmHg systolic or ≥90 mmHg diastolic on two separate readings taken at least four to six hours apart after 20 weeks' gestation in an individual with previously normal blood pressure. In a woman with essential hypertension beginning before 20 weeks' gestational age, the diagnostic criteria are an increase in systolic blood pressure (SBP) of ≥30 mmHg or an increase in diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of ≥15 mmHg. Proteinuria ≥ or more of protein in a 24-hour urine sample or a SPOT urinary protein to creatinine ratio ≥0.3 or a urine dipstick reading of 1+ or greater (dipstick reading should only be used if other quantitative methods are not available).",

        "title": "Aortocaval Compression Syndrome -- Pathophysiology",
        "content": "The uterus has a blood flow of approximately 60 milliliters per minute in the non-pregnant state.  However, at term, the uterus commands an impressive 600 milliliters per minute, which is a ten-fold increase.  Because of this increased vascular dynamic state, even a mild decrease in blood return may result in marked negative effects on maternal and fetal circulation. Aortocaval compression syndrome is characterized by initial tachycardia and late bradycardia, pallor, diaphoresis, nausea, hypotension, and dizziness. All of these symptoms are attributable to the impedance of blood flow back into maternal circulation from the lower extremities, which have increased venous pressures progressively throughout pregnancy.  It occurs when a pregnant woman lies on her back and subsequently resolves when she is turned on her side, thus alleviating the compressing pressure of the gravid uterus on the vena cava.",
