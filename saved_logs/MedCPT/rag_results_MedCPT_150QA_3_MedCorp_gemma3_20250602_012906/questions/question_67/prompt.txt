Document 1 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Although historically a disease of unvaccinated children, with the largest proportion of cases occurring in children 5–9 years of age during the prevaccine era, mumps now frequently occurs in older age groups—primarily college students, most of whom were vaccinated in early childhood. This shift in age distribution and the occurrence of mumps in vaccinated populations are probably the result of several coincident circumstances, including (1) situations promoting the spread of respiratory viruses among young adults (e.g., residence in college dormitories), (2) waning of vaccine immunity with time, (3) lack of endemically circulating wild-type virus to periodically boost vaccine-induced immune responses, and (4) continuing global epidemics (due to either lack of mumps vaccination programs or, where such programs do exist, low rates of mumps vaccination). The notable
Document 2 (Title: Mumps -- Complications): Studies of mumps outbreaks in the modern area have consistently reported lower rates of complications compared to those reported in the prevaccine era, suggesting that high levels of community-wide vaccination may protect against more severe mumps infections. [20] Comparative studies of complication rates among vaccinated and unvaccinated populations have been limited by low numbers of unvaccinated children in the United States. However, a study conducted during a large multi-year mumps outbreak in Israel found statistically significantly lower rates of complications and hospitalization among vaccinated people infected with mumps compared to unvaccinated cases.

Document 3 (Title: Yukthivadi): History and profile Yukthivadi started its publication in August 1929 from Ernakulam under the editorial board of M. Ramavarma Thampan, C. Krishnan, C. V. Kunhiraman, Sahodaran Ayyappan and M.C. Joseph. In a statement published in the first issue of Yukthivadi, Sahodaran K. Ayyappan wrote: Rationalism is not a religion. It is an attitude to accept knowledge based upon reason. Yukthivadi will attempt to generate such an attitude amongst the people. To do this, we will have to criticize irrational faiths and propagate rational knowledge. Since Yukthivadi does not believe in any ultimate knowledge, it will not hesitate to correct itself based upon the latest information and knowledge. Every rationalist is bound to do so. The only maxim that Yukthivadi accepts as unchangeable is that the knowledge should be based upon reason.
