In some conditions, the systemic effects of the viral infection are negligible; it is the neurologic disorder that brings them to medical attention, that is, the viruses are neurotropic. Included in this group are the human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV-1 and HIV-2), the group of human herpes viruses including herpes simplex viruses (HSV-1 and HSV-2), herpes zoster or varicella zoster virus (VZV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), poliovirus, rabies, and several seasonal arthropod-borne viruses (Flaviviruses). Some of these exhibit an affinity for certain types of neurons: for example, poliomyelitis viruses and motor neurons, VZV and peripheral sensory neurons, and rabies virus and brainstem neurons.
