        "content": "Brain stroke Brain stroke in a region affecting auditory function such as a posterior circulation infarct has been associated with deafness. Pathophysiology Sensory hearing loss is caused by abnormal structure or function of the hair cells of the organ of Corti in the cochlea. Neural hearing impairments are consequent upon damage to the eighth cranial nerve (the vestibulocochlear nerve) or the auditory tracts of the brainstem. If higher levels of the auditory tract are affected this is known as central deafness. Central deafness may present as sensorineural deafness but should be distinguishable from the history and audiological testing. Cochlear dead regions in sensory hearing loss",

MRI in tuberculous meningitis showing gadolinium enhancement of the basal meninges, reflecting multiple abscesses, accompanied by hydrocephalus and cranial nerve palsies. Figure 31-4. A tuberculoma of the pons on a gadolinium-enhanced MRI (left panel). There is a thick, uniform enhancing rim. The mass behaved clinically like a malignant brain tumor.

        "content": "Sporadic VSs originate within the confining bony walls of the small (ca. 2 cm long) internal auditory canal. The most common early symptoms of these intracanalicular (IAC) VSs are gradual hearing loss and a feeling of fullness in the affected ear, some imbalance or dizziness, and tinnitus (ringing or other noise in the ear). Gradual single-sided hearing loss in the high frequencies is the first most obvious symptom for the great majority of patients. Headache as a presenting symptom of VS specifically is rare; facial symptoms (facial numbness, weakness) usually occur only as the tumor grows out of the canal and/or after therapeutic treatment. Delayed diagnosis and misdiagnosis are not unusual. Initial hearing loss is usually subtle and may be attributed mistakenly to aging, earwax buildup, or perhaps exposure to some loud environmental noise. A sudden hearing loss, which is uncommon, might be misdiagnosed as Ménière's disease, an abnormality of the middle ear that also has tinnitus as",
