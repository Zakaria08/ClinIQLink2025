        "content": "A number of new acyl and imidoderivatives of 2-amino-4-p-chlorophenylthiazole-5-acetic acid (II) and its methyl ester (VII) were synthesized. Methyl ester VII heated in benzene solution with acid anhydrides was transformed into adequate acyl derivatives (VIII, IX, X, XIII, XVI). Some of them (X, XIII, XVII) by heating with acetic anhydride underwent cyclization and were transformed into the imido derivatives (XI, XIV, XVIII). Compounds XI, XIV and XVI heated with diluted aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide underwent selective hydrolysis giving the respective dicarboxylic acids XII, XV, XVII. Pharmacological analysis revealed that some of the synthesized preparations exert an anti-inflammatory effect and allow to draw limited relations between chemical structure and pharmacological activity in this group of compounds.",

        "content": "Because an OH– ion combines with a H3O+ ion to form two water molecules, an increase in the OH– concentration forces a decrease in the concentration of H3O+, and vice versa. A pure solution of water contains an equal concentration (10–7 M) of both ions, rendering it neutral. The interior of a cell is also kept close to neutrality by the presence of buffers: weak acids and bases that can release or take up protons near pH 7, keeping the environment of the cell relatively constant under a variety of conditions. Figure 2–5 Protons readily move in aqueous solutions. (a) The reaction that takes place when a molecule of acetic acid dissolves in water. at ph 7, nearly all of the acetic acid is present as acetate ion. (B) Water molecules are continuously exchanging protons with each other to form hydronium and hydroxyl ions. These ions in turn rapidly recombine to form water molecules. a Cell is formed from Carbon Compounds",
