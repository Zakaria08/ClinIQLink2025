The direct effect of\u00a0growth hormone involves growth hormone directly binding to its receptors on target cells to stimulate a response. The indirect effect is mediated by the action of insulin-like growth factor-1(IGF-1), which is secreted by the liver hepatocytes in response to growth hormone.\u00a0Insulin-like\u00a0growth\u00a0factor-1 binds to its receptor, IGF-1R, on the cellular surface. It activates a tyrosine kinase-mediated intracellular signaling pathway that phosphorylates various proteins intracellularly, leading to increased anabolism, cellular replication and division, and metabolism.

        "content": "The insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) receptor is a protein found on the surface of human cells. It is a transmembrane receptor that is activated by a hormone called insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and by a related hormone called IGF-2. It belongs to the large class of tyrosine kinase receptors. This receptor mediates the effects of IGF-1, which is a polypeptide protein hormone similar in molecular structure to insulin. IGF-1 plays an important role in growth and continues to have anabolic effects in adults \u2013 meaning that it can induce hypertrophy of skeletal muscle and other target tissues. Mice lacking the IGF-1 receptor die late in development, and show a dramatic reduction in body mass. This testifies to the strong growth-promoting effect of this receptor. Structure",

Hypothalamicreleasing or inhibiting factors travel through capillaries of the pituitary portal system to control the anterior pituitary gland,regulating the hormones specific for the factor (Fig. 170-2).The pituitary hormones enter the peripheral circulation andexert their effects on target glands, which produce other hormones that feed back to suppress their controlling hypothalamicand pituitary hormones. Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1),growth hormone (GH), cortisol, sex steroids, and thyroxine (T4)all feed back on the hypothalamic-pituitary system. Prolactin isthe only pituitary hormone that is suppressed by a hypothalamicfactor, dopamine. The hypothalamus is also the location of vasopressin-secreting axons that either terminate in the posteriorpituitary gland and exert their effect via vasopressin secretion",
