        "content": "The following are the major rickettsial diseases: 1. Epidemic typhus, small pockets of which are present in many developing parts of the world. It is transmitted from lice to humans and from person to person. 2. Murine (endemic) typhus, which is present in the same areas as Rocky Mountain spotted fever (see in the following text). It is transmitted by fleas from rats to humans. 3. Scrub typhus or tsutsugamushi fever, which is confined to eastern and southeastern Asia. It is transmitted by mites from infected rodents or humans. 4. Rocky Mountain spotted fever, first described in Montana, is most common in Long Island, Tennessee, Virginia, North Carolina, and Maryland and in the Southwest. It is transmitted by special varieties of ticks.",

        "content": "Scrub typhus is a significant cause of underdiagnosed acute febrile illness and is prevalent in endemic regions. This disease can affect multiple organ systems primarily through vasculitis and perivascular inflammation. Mite larvae or chiggers, which carry the pathogenic gram-negative bacteria,\u00a0are the\u00a0vectors to humans, and they transmit the organism through their bite. The infection persists in nature through transovarial transmission in the vector and occasionally in small mammals as a reservoir. [4]",

This imported rickettsial disease was contracted by a 30-year-old woman while traveling in Thailand, and was transmitted by an infected mite's bite. Diagnosis was confirmed by specific serology and resolution was obtained by tetracycline therapy. Current concepts of the disease are reviewed.",
