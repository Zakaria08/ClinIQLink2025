With your own knowledge and the help of the following document:

Document 1 (Title: A common pathophysiology for full thickness rectal prolapse, anterior mucosal prolapse and solitary rectal ulcer.): Anorectal pressures at rest, during conscious contraction of the external sphincter, during serial distension of the rectum and during straining to inflate a balloon were measured in 56 patients (21 patients with full thickness rectal prolapse, 24 patients with anterior mucosal prolapse, 11 patients with solitary rectal ulcer) and in 30 normal subjects. Both basal and squeeze pressures were significantly lower in the three groups of patients compared with matched normal controls (P less than 0.05). During increases in intra-abdominal pressure, anal pressure remained above maximum rectal pressure (P less than 0.05) in normal controls, with the highest anal pressures being recorded in the most caudal anal channels. In contrast, anal pressures tended to be lower than rectal pressures during this manoeuvre in patients with rectal prolapse, anterior mucosal prolapse and solitary rectal ulcer, and the highest pressures were recorded in the channels nearest the rectum. During serial distension of the rectum, 64 per cent of patients with solitary rectal ulcer, 75 per cent with anterior mucosal prolapse and 76 per cent with rectal prolapse, but only 10 per cent of controls, showed repetitive rectal contractions. The highest anal pressure always remained higher than rectal pressure during rectal distension in normal subjects (P less than 0.05) but not in patients. The threshold rectal volume required to cause a desire to defaecate and the maximum tolerable volume were significantly lower (P less than 0.05) in each of the patient groups, compared with normal subjects. The similarity in the results from patients with rectal prolapse, anterior mucosal prolapse and solitary rectal ulcer support the hypothesis that they share a common pathophysiology. In each of the groups, the rectum is hypersensitive and hyper-reactive, and weakness of the anal sphincter creates the conditions for prolapse of the rectum to occur into or through the anal canal.
Document 2 (Title: Constipation): Examination A physical examination should involve at least an abdominal exam and rectal exam. Abdominal exam may reveal an abdominal mass if there is significant stool burden and may reveal abdominal discomfort. Rectal examination gives an impression of the anal sphincter tone and whether the lower rectum contains any feces or not. Rectal examination also gives information on the consistency of the stool, the presence of hemorrhoids, blood and whether any perineal irregularities are present including skin tags, fissures, anal warts. Physical examination is done manually by a physician and is used to guide which diagnostic tests to order. Diagnostic tests Functional constipation is common and does not warrant diagnostic testing. Imaging and laboratory tests are typically recommended for those with alarm signs or symptoms.
Document 3 (Title: Anal Fissures -- Differential Diagnosis): An anal fissure is a clinical diagnosis made essentially by physical exam alone, which must be done to rule out other possible causes of rectal pain. Hemorrhoids are the most common finding in patients with rectal pain. However, only external hemorrhoids are painful, especially if they are thrombosed. Patients can also have perianal abscesses that cause pain on defecation and can bleed. Perianal abscesses can also form anal fistulas to a deeper site and either bleed or have purulent drainage. Patients with sexually transmitted infections, inflammatory bowel disease, or tuberculosis can form perianal ulcerations. A rare condition known as solitary rectal ulcer syndrome can also be encountered; however, this lesion has no known cause and is usually found by sigmoidoscopy, several centimeters proximal to the anus itself.
