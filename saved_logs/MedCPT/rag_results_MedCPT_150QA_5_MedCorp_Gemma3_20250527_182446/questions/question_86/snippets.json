        "content": "Other than dust mites, house dust allergy can be caused by the following allergen sources: Mold. The fungus grows in a humid environment like house basements, kitchens, gardens, and bathrooms. The spores of the mold become airborne, which on inhalation leads to allergic rhinitis. Cockroaches. These are found in a variety of environments. The saliva, fecal matter, and shed off parts of cockroaches serve as potential allergens for triggering allergies. Around 68 percent of households in the USA are known to have cockroach allergens. The percentage increases further in urban areas. Pollen. Flowers, grass, weeds, and trees are sources of pollens that constitute an essential component of household dust. These are a common cause for triggering allergic reactions. Pets. Fur, feathers, animal hair, dander, saliva, and fecal matter all serve as allergens. [31] Dust mite allergy can be confused with non-allergic forms of rhinitis. [32] These include the following:",

        "content": "A microtechnique is described to visualize pollen allergens by making prints from the surface of mature grains on nitrocellulose membrane. The allergen Lol p I is detected by specific monoclonal antibodies or specific IgE from sera of grass-pollen-allergic patients, visualized by the immunoperoxidase method. This technique offers the potential to study the distribution of individual allergens in aerobiology samples by bright-field microscopy, and to determine the sensitivity spectra of allergic individuals to known and unknown pollen sources.",

        "content": "In order to determine the sequential prevalence of pollen grains and fungi spores in the city of Caracas by the volumetric method of collection and its effect on the population at risk, the first multidisciplinary team of aerobiological research was structured through a protocol designed for five experimental stages namely: a) Determination of the climatological parameters: temperature, relative humidity, speed and wind direction, precipitation and atmospheric stability, through simultaneous records of meteorological status located in the metropolitan area of Caracas; b) Collection, identification, classification and determination of the local distribution of the most important pollen grains existing in the zone under study; c) Collection, identification and classification of the most important fungi spores in the area; d) Preparation of the first pollinic calendar of Caracas and e) Evaluation of possible implication of the environment and the response through the IgE antibody in the selected patients in the area under study. Our results show: 1) The climatic conditions existing during the sampling period coincide with the analysis of the last 20 years in the Valley of Caracas. 2) The Venezuelan Central University (UCV) station was elected as the most representative point for permanent sampling. 3) An ideal statistical method is obtained in order to determine the spatial arrangement in the sampler rod of a dense type of fungi spores typical of the area under study. 4) The first pollinic calendar of Caracas was structured and 5) A seasonal tendency of the IgE response is shown. These results suggest an evident interrelation between the suggested concept of polyseasonality and antigenic polysensitization, and between individual seasonality with a specific reactivity and, finally, between tropical mixed seasonality with the expression of combined respiratory pathologies in our environment.",
