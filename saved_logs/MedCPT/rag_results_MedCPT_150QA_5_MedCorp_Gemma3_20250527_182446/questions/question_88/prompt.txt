Document 1 (Title: Corneal wound healing in monkeys 18 months after excimer laser photorefractive keratectomy.): Excimer laser keratomileusis (photorefractive keratectomy, direct corneal ablation) for myopic corrections of 2.00 diopters (n = 1), 4.00 D (n = 4), and 8.00 D (n = 3) was performed on eight corneas of four Rhesus monkeys. All animals were followed for 18 months. The ablations healed normally and no epithelial erosions occurred. Serial slit-lamp microscope examinations revealed that a variable amount of corneal haze developed in all animals; this haze progressively faded during the follow-up period. Histopathology revealed an epithelium of normal thickness, basement membrane abnormalities, increased number and activity of stromal keratocytes, and a variable amount of newly secreted extracellular matrix in the anterior stroma. These findings suggest that excimer laser keratomileusis induces a mild wound healing response in the anterior cornea which displays considerable individual variability and persists up to 18 months.
Document 2 (Title: Histology_Ross): It is believed that the uniform spacing of collagen fibrils and lamellae, as well as the orthogonal array of the lamellae (alternating layers at right angles), is responsible for the transparency of the cornea. Proteoglycans (lumican), along with type V collagen, regulate the precise diameter and spacing of the collagen fibrils. Swelling of the cornea after injury to the epithelium or endothelium disrupts this precise array and leads to translucency or opacity of the cornea. Lumican is FIGURE 24.5 • Electron micrograph of the corneal stroma. This electron micrograph shows parts of three lamellae and a portion of a corneal fibroblast (CF) between two of the lamellae.

Document 3 (Title: Photorefractive Keratectomy -- Anatomy and Physiology): Laser refractive surgeries act upon the surface of the cornea, the transparent, dome-shaped, outermost layer that covers the front of the eye. The first step of PRK requires complete removal of the superficial corneal epithelium down to Bowman’s layer. The excimer laser then ablates the stroma, thereby remodeling the corneal surface. Further information regarding the excimer laser follows below. Following the procedure, re-epithelialization occurs via the migration of fibroblasts and collagen synthesis. [2]
Document 4 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): developments in Excimer laser technology have led to increased optimism regarding the ability to safely deliver laser energy. Excimer laser atherectomy approved by the FDA for peripheral artery intervention employs precision laser energy control (shallow tissue penetration) and safer wavelengths (ultraviolet as opposed to the infrared spectra in older laser technology), which decrease perforation and thermal injury to the treated vessels.A laser atherectomy catheter, with diameters varying from 0.9 to 2.5 mm, is tracked over the guidewire to the desired tar-get. Once activated, the Excimer laser uses ultraviolet energy to ablate the lesion and create a nonthrombogenic arterial lumen. This lumen is further dilated by an angioplasty balloon. Because the Excimer laser can potentially reduce the rate of distal embo-lization by evaporating the lesion, it may be used as an adjunct tool for ostial lesions and lesions that can be traversed by a wire but not an angioplasty balloon
Document 5 (Title: Refractive surgery): Transepithelial photorefractive keratectomy (TransPRK) is a laser-assisted eye surgery to correct refraction errors of human eye cornea. It employs excimer laser to ablate outer layer of cornea, epithelium, as well its connective tissue, stroma, to correct eye optical power. Laser Assisted Sub-Epithelium Keratomileusis (LASEK) is a procedure that also changes the shape of the cornea using an excimer laser to ablate the tissue from the corneal stroma, under the corneal epithelium, which is kept mostly intact to act as a natural bandage. The surgeon uses an alcohol solution to loosen then lift a thin layer of the epithelium with a trephine blade (usually with a thickness of 50 micrometres). During the weeks following LASEK, the epithelium heals, leaving no permanent flap in the cornea. This healing process can involve discomfort comparable to that with PRK.
