        "content": "Cause Rarely, infantile pyloric stenosis can occur as an autosomal dominant condition. It is uncertain whether it is a congenital anatomic narrowing or a functional hypertrophy of the pyloric sphincter muscle. Pathophysiology The gastric outlet obstruction due to the hypertrophic pylorus impairs emptying of gastric contents into the duodenum. As a consequence, all ingested food and gastric secretions can only exit via vomiting, which can be of a projectile nature. While the exact cause of the hypertrophy remains unknown, one study suggested that neonatal hyperacidity may be involved in the pathogenesis. This physiological explanation for the development of clinical pyloric stenosis at around 4 weeks and its spontaneous long term cure without surgery if treated conservatively, has recently been further reviewed.",

        "title": "Gastroschisis -- Treatment / Management -- Delivery",
        "content": "Infants with gastroschisis\u00a0have no contraindication to vaginal delivery based on gastroschisis alone. The timing of delivery is based on gestation age (lung maturity), ultrasound findings (fetal growth profile, bowel appearance), and fetal testing results. Care for the infant is usually managed by a group of specialists, including a maternal-fetal medicine specialist, neonatologist, and pediatric surgery, to discuss patient-specific factors before delivery. The mean gestational age for spontaneous delivery in women carrying infants with gastroschisis is the 36th week of gestation. [17] [18] A survey of practice patterns demonstrated forty percent of maternal-fetal medicine specialists deliver infants at 37 weeks, 30 percent deliver at 39 weeks if gastroschisis is stable. The remainder delivers infants before 37 weeks. [13] Overall, many maternal-medicine specialists allow a trial of vaginal delivery. When there is marked liver herniation, a cesarean section should be considered. One factor that some specialists utilize to determine continued gestation is if the bowel does not dilate greater than 25 mm after 37 weeks gestation.",

        "title": "Severity of intestinal damage in gastroschisis: correlation with prenatal sonographic findings.",
        "content": "From 1982 to 1986, 26 abdominal wall defects were detected prenatally. Seventeen pregnancies culminated in live births with ultrasound correctly distinguishing between omphalocele and gastroschisis in all cases. In the 11 cases of gastroschisis diagnosed before birth, we attempted to correlate the clinical outcome with the size of the abdominal wall defect, sonographic appearance of the eviscerated bowel, and known time of exposure to amniotic fluid (gestational age at birth to gestational age at diagnosis). Neither the time of exposure to amniotic fluid (median duration of 14 weeks) nor the defect size could be correlated with eventual clinical outcome. The presence of small bowel dilatation and mural thickening on prenatal sonography (four patients) had a high correlation with severe intestinal damage and poor clinical outcome. The absence of these two sonographic findings (seven patients) was associated with mild intestinal changes and benign clinical course with no morbidity or mortality. We conclude that obstetric ultrasound cannot only accurately detect the presence and type of abdominal wall defect, but it also gives an indication of the severity of intestinal damage and subsequent clinical course in prenatally diagnosed cases of gastroschisis. Early delivery of the fetus with prenatally diagnosed gastroschisis should no longer be performed to limit exposure to amniotic fluid. Now that reliable sonographic criteria of severe intestinal damage have been defined, the decision to deliver early can be restricted to those fetuses with bowel dilatation and mural thickening.",
