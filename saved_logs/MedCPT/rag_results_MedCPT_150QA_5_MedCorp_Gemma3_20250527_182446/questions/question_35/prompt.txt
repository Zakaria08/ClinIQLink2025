Document 1 (Title: Community-acquired pneumonia): Hospitalization Some CAP patients require intensive care, with clinical prediction rules such as the pneumonia severity index and CURB-65 guiding the decision whether or not to hospitalize. Factors increasing the need for hospitalization include: Age greater than 65 Underlying chronic illnesses Respiratory rate greater than 30 per minute Systolic blood pressure less than 90 mmHg Heart rate greater than 125 per minute Temperature below 35 or over 40 °C Confusion Evidence of infection outside the lung Laboratory results indicating hospitalization include: Arterial oxygen tension less than 60 mm Hg Carbon dioxide over 50 mmHg or pH under 7.35 while breathing room air Hematocrit under 30 percent Creatinine over 1.2 mg/dl or blood urea nitrogen over 20 mg/dl White-blood-cell count under 4 × 10^9/L or over 30 × 10^9/L Neutrophil count under 1 x 10^9/L
Document 2 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): Philip J. Rosenthal, MD A 5-year-old American girl presents with a 1-week history of intermittent chills, fever, and sweats. She had returned home 2 weeks earlier after leaving the USA for the first time to spend 3 weeks with her grandparents in Nigeria. She received all standard childhood immunizations, but no additional treat-ment before travel, since her parents have returned to their native Nigeria frequently without medical consequences. Three days ago, the child was seen in an outpatient clinic and diagnosed with a viral syndrome. Examination reveals a lethargic child, with a temperature of 39.8°C (103.6°F) and splenomegaly. She has no skin rash or lymphadenopathy. Ini-tial laboratory studies are remarkable for hematocrit 29.8%, platelets 45,000/mm3, creatinine 2.5 mg/dL (220 μmol/L), and mildly elevated bilirubin and transaminases. A blood smear shows ring forms of Plasmodium falciparum at 1.5% parasit-emia. What treatment should be started?
Document 3 (Title: Diuretic abuse and central pontine myelinolysis.): Patients with eating disorders often use diuretics to eliminate fluid to achieve lower body weight. Diuretic abuse can lead to severe hyponatremia. Central pontine myelinolysis, a disruption of the myelinated neurons of the pons, has been associated with rapid correction of severe hyponatremia. A case is presented of a 35-year-old woman who was brought to the emergency service by ambulance complaining of vomiting for 7 days and that she could not hear well because she was 'worn out'. Initial laboratory values included serum Na 91 mEq/l, K 1.6, Cl 46, bicarbonate 33, BUN 4 mg/dl, glucose 306 mg/dl. After 32 h of intravenous fluids, the serum Na was 126, K 4.0, Cl 89, bicarbonate 25, glucose 118 mg/dl. On the 3rd hospital day the serum Na was 139. On the 4th hospital day she was alert and appropriate. On the 5th hospital day, however, she was confabulating and chatty. The serum Na was 139. She progressed to develop a spastic quadriparesis, speech and swallowing difficulties. A magnetic resonance imaging scan showed central pontine myelinolysis. She acknowledged taking 400 mg daily of furosemide and drinking much water. She had a past history of anorexia nervosa. She had a residual weight phobia and strove to keep her weight below 106 lb. Her height was 5 feet, 6 inches. As illustrated by this case, diuretic abuse can cause severe hyponatremia and the subsequent risk of central pontine myelinolysis. In patients with severe chronic or subacute hyponatremia, a safe restoration rate for serum Na has been less than 0.55 mEq/l/h. Serum Na should be below 135 within the first 48 h and hypernatremia should be avoided.
Document 4 (Title: Root Cause Analysis and Medical Error Prevention -- Function -- Case example 1): A 42-year-old primigravida woman at 34 weeks gestation was brought to the obstetric emergency department at midnight with complaints of severe headache, blurry vision, and right upper quadrant pain for the last 5 to 6 hours. She noted lower extremity edema and facial swelling that was gradually increasing. She has gestational hypertension and, 1 week ago, was prescribed labetalol 200 mg twice a day. On initial presentation, her blood pressure was 190/110 mm Hg on 2 separate occasions, 5 minutes apart. She had gained 2 kilograms since her last antenatal checkup in the clinic a week ago. The patient was diagnosed with severe preeclampsia. The senior obstetric resident ordered a loading dose of magnesium sulfate to prevent imminent seizure. The hospital protocol used an intravenous (IV) and intramuscular (IM) regimen where the patient received a 4 g IV bolus and a 10 g IM dose administered as 5 g in each buttock. The senior resident gave verbal orders for magnesium sulfate administration to the junior resident, who verbally communicated the order to the nurse.
Document 5 (Title: Anatomy_Gray): This patient had no symptoms attributable to the pelvic kidney and she was discharged. A 19-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with a 36-hour history of lower abdominal pain that was sharp and initially intermittent, later becoming constant and severe. The patient also reported feeling nauseated and vomited once in the ER. She did not have diarrhea and had opened her bowels normally 8 hours before admission. She had no symptoms of dysuria. She was afebrile, slightly tachycardic at 95/min, and had a normal blood pressure. Blood results showed mild leukocytosis of 11.6 x 109/L and normal renal and liver function tests. She reported being sexually active with a long-term partner. She was never pregnant, and the urine pregnancy test on admission was negative.

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
Question: A 19-year-old woman, accompanied by her parents, presents after a one-week history of abnormal behavior, delusions, and unusual aggression. She denies fever, seizures or illicit drug use. Family history is negative for psychiatric illnesses. She was started on risperidone and sent home with her parents. Three days later, she is brought to the emergency department with fever and confusion. She is not verbally responsive. At the hospital, her temperature is 39.8°C (103.6°F), the blood pressure is 100/60 mm Hg, the pulse rate is 102/min, and the respiratory rate is 16/min. She is extremely diaphoretic and appears stiff. She has spontaneous eye-opening but she is not verbally responsive and she is not following commands. Laboratory studies show: Sodium 142 mmol/L Potassium 5.0 mmol/L Creatinine 1.8 mg/dl Calcium 10.4 mg/dl Creatine kinase 9800 U/L White blood cells 14,500/mm3 Hemoglobin 12.9 g/dl Platelets 175,000/mm3 Urinalysis shows protein 1+, hemoglobin 3+ with occasional leukocytes and no red blood casts. What is the best first step in the management of this condition?
Options:
A. Intravenous hydration
B. Paracetamol
C. Stop risperidone
D. Switch risperidone to clozapine
