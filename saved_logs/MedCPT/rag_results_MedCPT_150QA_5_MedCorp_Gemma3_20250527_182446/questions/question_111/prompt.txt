Document 1 (Title: Physiology_Levy): All signaling molecules bind to specific receptors that act as signal transducers, thereby converting a ligand-receptor binding event into intracellular signals that affect cellular function. Receptors can be divided into four basic classes on the basis of their structure and mechanism of action: (1) ligand-gated ion channels, (2) G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs), (3) enzyme-linked receptors, and (4) nuclear receptors ( Table 3.1 Figs. 3.4 3.5). Fig. 3.4A). Neurotransmitters bind to receptors and either open or close ion channels, thereby changing the ionic permeability of the plasma membrane and altering the membrane potential. For examples and more details, see GPCRs regulate the activity of other proteins, such as enzymes and ion channels (see Fig. 3.4B ). In the example in
Document 2 (Title: Regulation of phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C.): The receptors involved in the regulation of phospholipase C by hormones, neurotransmitters and other ligands have seven transmembrane-spanning hydrophobic regions (seven-helix motif) and no known enzymatic activity. Furthermore these receptors can be isolated as complexes with guanine nucleotide binding (G) proteins. Guanine nucleotides affect the binding of hormones that stimulate phospholipase C and it has been possible to see activation of GTPase activity in membranes upon addition of these ligands. Further indirect evidence for a Gp (p stands for phospholipase C activation) protein is the finding that in membranes agonist activation of phospholipase C requires the presence of GTP gamma S a non-hydrolyzable analog of GTP. Furthermore, fluoride is able to activate phospholipase C but its inhibition of phosphatidylinositol-4' kinase (PI-4' kinase) can interfere with efforts to demonstrate this in intact cells. There are four major isozymes of phospholipase C that have been cloned and sequenced. Recently it was found that phospholipase C-gamma as well as PI-3'-kinase are substrates for phosphorylation on tyrosine residues by the EGF and PDGF receptors. The PI-3' kinase is able to convert phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) but the function of this lipid is unknown since it is not a substrate for any known phospholipase C. While much has been learned about the structure and regulation of the phosphoinositide specific kinases and phosphodiesterase enzymes this is a relatively new field in which we can expect many advances during the next few years.
Document 3 (Title: L-type calcium channel): L-type calcium channels are also modulated by G protein-coupled receptors and the adrenergic nervous system. Protein Kinase A (PKA) activated by a G protein-coupled receptors cascade can phosphorylate L-type calcium channels, after channels form a signaling complex with A-Kinase-Anchoring proteins (AKAPs) , to increase calcium current through the channel, increasing the open-state probability, and an accelerated recovery period. Activated Phospholipase C (PLC) from G protein-coupled receptors can breakdown polyphosphoinositides to decrease the channels calcium current by 20%-30%. The adrenergic nervous system has been seen to modulate L-type calcium channels by cleaving the C-terminal fragment when the β-adrenergic receptor is stimulated to increase activation of the channels.

Document 4 (Title: Calcium signaling): Phospholipase C Pathway Specific signals can trigger a sudden increase in the cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels to 500–1,000 nM by opening channels in the ER or the plasma membrane. The most common signaling pathway that increases cytoplasmic calcium concentration is the phospholipase C (PLC) pathway. Many cell surface receptors, including G protein-coupled receptors and receptor tyrosine kinases, activate the PLC enzyme. PLC uses hydrolysis of the membrane phospholipid PIP2 to form IP3 and diacylglycerol (DAG), two classic secondary messengers. DAG attaches to the plasma membrane and recruits protein kinase C (PKC). IP3 diffuses to the ER and is bound to the IP3 receptor. The IP3 receptor serves as a Ca2+ channel, and releases Ca2+ from the ER. The Ca2+ bind to PKC and other proteins and activate them.
Document 5 (Title: Biochemistry, G Protein Coupled Receptors -- Fundamentals -- Signaling by GPCRs): While IP3 is known to interact with the IP3 receptors at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and results in intracellular calcium release, DAG is best known for its role in the activation of protein kinase C (PKC). In some other cases, GPCRs can directly affect the ion channel activity in the plasma membrane, thereby regulating the ion permeability and membrane potential of the membrane. Yet, other GPCRs can regulate ion channels indirectly by regulating the phosphorylation of signaling proteins such as PKA and PKC. [10]
