With your own knowledge and the help of the following document:

Document 1 (Title: Systemic inflammatory response syndrome): Many experts consider the current criteria for a SIRS diagnosis to be overly sensitive, as nearly all (>90%) of patients admitted to the ICU meet the SIRS criteria. Adult Manifestations of SIRS include, but are not limited to: Body temperature less than 36 °C (96.8 °F) or greater than 38 °C (100.4 °F) Heart rate greater than 90 beats per minute Tachypnea (high respiratory rate), with greater than 20 breaths per minute; or, an arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide less than 4.3 kPa (32 mmHg) White blood cell count less than 4000 cells/mm³ (4 x 109 cells/L) or greater than 12,000 cells/mm³ (12 x 109 cells/L); or the presence of greater than 10% immature neutrophils (band forms). Band forms greater than 3% is called bandemia or a "left-shift."
Document 2 (Title: Biochemistry_Lippinco): Patient Presentation: BE is a 45-year-old woman who presents with concerns about sudden (paroxysmal), intense, brief episodes of headache, sweating (diaphoresis), and a racing heart (palpitations). Focused History: BE reports that the attacks started ~3 weeks ago. They last from 2 to 10 minutes, during which time she feels quite anxious. During the attacks, it feels as though her heart is skipping beats (arrhythmia). At first, she thought the attacks were related to recent stress at work and maybe even menopause. The last time it happened, she was in a pharmacy and had her blood pressure taken. She was told it was 165/110 mm Hg. BE notes that she has lost weight (~8 lbs) in this period even though her appetite has been good.
Document 3 (Title: [Pseudosurgical acute abdomen syndrome in primary pulmonary hypertension].): The case is reported of a 49-year-old chronic alcoholic woman, who presented with severe pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) mimicking as an acute abdomen. She was admitted with right-sided hypochondrial abdominal pain and hepatomegaly, with a moderate jaundice. On admission to intensive care unit, she had an arterial blood pressure of 110/70 mmHg, a heart rate of 100 b.min-1, and a respiratory rate of 36 c.min-1. An electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm and right-sided heart failure. Whilst breathing 6 l.min-1 oxygen, her arterial blood gases were: PaO2 47 mmHg PaCO2 29 mmHg. Severe PAH was confirmed by measuring her mean pulmonary arterial pressure, which was 46 mmHg, whilst her pulmonary wedge pressure was 7 mmHg. Hepatic function was also altered: total bilirubin 41 mumol.l-1, alkaline phosphatase 145 UI.l-1 and gamma glutamyl transferase 1 340 UI.l-1. She developed arterial hypotension, which did not respond to increasing doses of isoproterenol. She died on the third day. Necropsy confirmed the diagnosis of primary PAH, with acute "cardiac liver".
Document 4 (Title: Case Study: 33-Year-Old Female Presents with Chronic SOB and Cough (Archived) -- Case Presentation -- Physical Exam:): Vitals: Temperature, 97.8 F; heart rate 88; respiratory rate, 22; blood pressure 130/86; body mass index, 28 General: She is well appearing but anxious, a pleasant female lying on a hospital stretcher. She is conversing freely, with respiratory distress causing her to stop mid-sentence. Respiratory: She has diffuse rales and mild wheezing; tachypneic. Cardiovascular: She has a regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Gastrointestinal: Bowel sounds X4. No bruits or pulsatile mass.
Document 5 (Title: Case Study: 33-Year-Old Female Presents with Chronic SOB and Cough (Archived) -- Case Presentation): History of Present Illness: A 33-year-old white female presents after admission to the general medical/surgical hospital ward with a chief complaint of shortness of breath on exertion. She reports that she was seen for similar symptoms previously at her primary care physician’s office six months ago. At that time, she was diagnosed with acute bronchitis and treated with bronchodilators, empiric antibiotics, and a short course oral steroid taper. This management did not improve her symptoms, and she has gradually worsened over six months. She reports a 20-pound (9 kg) intentional weight loss over the past year. She denies camping, spelunking, or hunting activities. She denies any sick contacts. A brief review of systems is negative for fever, night sweats, palpitations, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, neural sensation changes, muscular changes, and increased bruising or bleeding. She admits a cough, shortness of breath, and shortness of breath on exertion.

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
Question: A 42-year-old woman is in the hospital recovering from a cholecystectomy performed 3 days ago that was complicated by cholangitis. She is being treated with IV piperacillin-tazobactam. She calls the nurse to her room because she says that her heart is racing. She also demands that someone come in to clean the pile of garbage off of the floor because it is attracting flies. Her pulse is 112/min, respiratory rate is 20/min, temperature is 38.0°C (100.4°F), and blood pressure is 150/90 mm Hg. On physical examination, the patient appears sweaty, distressed, and unable to remain still. She is oriented to person, but not place or time. Palpation of the abdomen shows no tenderness, rebound, or guarding. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?
Options:
A. Acute cholangitis
B. Alcoholic hallucinosis
C. Delirium tremens
D. Hepatic encephalopathy
