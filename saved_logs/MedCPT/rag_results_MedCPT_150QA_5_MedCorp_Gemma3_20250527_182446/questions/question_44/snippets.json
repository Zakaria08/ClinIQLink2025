        "title": "Lamivudine/zidovudine",
        "content": "Mechanism of action The combination of lamivudine and zidovudine is composed of two nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). Lamivudine and zidovudine both competitively inhibit and reduce the activity of reverse transcriptase (RT) causing HIV infected cells to decrease the number of viruses in the body. Lamivudine and zidovudine act as nucleoside analogs, which are substrates for the human nucleoside kinases. The initial phosphorylation step is crucial for the drug's activity, then converted into the active 5\u2019-triphosphate form by host kinases. The drug is then incorporated to the end of the growing chain of the viral DNA causing the chain to be terminated, where nucleotides can no longer be added to the growing viral DNA. Lamividuine and zidovudine combination therapy is believed to work synergistically together to prevent mutations in the HIV virus, which can contribute to drug resistance.",

        "content": "Three familial cases of psittacosis are reported. The first case was a 46-year-old woman, the second case, her 18-year-old daughter. Both of them often visited the house of the third case, a 49-year-old women, who was the elder sister of case 1 and who took care of the chick of a budgerigar which she kept in the house. Case 1 came to our hospital with abrupt onset of fever, headache, nausea and general malaise. Because she was suspected to have meningitis, she was admitted to the Department of Neurology. On admission, her chest X-ray film showed bilateral ground glass shadows. She also had hypoxemia and liver dysfunction. On learning of her history of contact with the chick, psittacosis was suspected. Case 2 suffered from fever and headache. Her chest X-ray film revealed opaque infiltration in the right lower lung field. Case 3 complained of fever, headache and vomiting. Her chest X-ray film showed fan-shaped faint shadows in the left upper, middle and lower lung fields. We interpreted these findings as showing psittacosis based on anamnesis. The result of the complement fixation (CF) antibody titer against chlamydia was 1:32 in cases 2 and 3, enabling a serological diagnosis of psittacosis. The corresponding result was 1:16 in case 1. Although the CF antibody titer showed no increase, we diagnosed the case clinically as psittacosis. It is difficult to correctly diagnose psittacosis only from the physical findings and chest X-ray films. Detailed anamnesis, in particular taking a history of exposure to birds, is an important clue for diagnosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
