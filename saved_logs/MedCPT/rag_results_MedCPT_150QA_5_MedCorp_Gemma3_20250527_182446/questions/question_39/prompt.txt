Document 1 (Title: Biochemistry, Aerobic Glycolysis -- Clinical Significance): Glucokinase Deficiency : Both glucokinase and hexokinase perform the same function of phosphorylating glucose to glucose-6-phosphate and trapping it in the cell. The difference between the two lies in their location and affinity to glucose. Glucokinase is present in the liver and pancreatic beta cells. Hexokinase, its isomer form, is present in tissues other than liver and pancreatic beta cells. Glucokinase has a much lower affinity for glucose than hexokinase and will function only when the glucose levels are high. After a meal, when blood glucose levels rise, glucokinase directs it toward glycogen synthesis and storage in the liver. When the glucose levels are low, hexokinase with high affinity will get to the glucose first so as to provide the glucose to cells that need it the most. Additionally, glucokinase in pancreatic beta cells acts as a glucose sensor and regulates the rate of entry of glucose into cells and into glycolysis, and therefore helps maintain the proper glucose levels in the blood. Heterozygous inactivating mutations of glucokinase result in maturity-onset diabetes of the young type 2 (MODY2 or GCK-MODY) [4] [5] . Homozygous mutations result in a complete deficiency of this enzyme and cause neonatal diabetes mellitus [6] [7] [8] .
Document 2 (Title: Biochemistry_Lippinco): 1. Hexokinases I–III: In most tissues, glucose phosphorylation is catalyzed by one of these isozymes of hexokinase, which is one of three regulatory enzymes of glycolysis (along with phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase). They are inhibited by the reaction product glucose 6-phosphate, which accumulates when further metabolism of this hexose phosphate is reduced. Hexokinases I–III have a low Michaelis constant (Km) and, therefore, a high affinity (see p. 59) for glucose. This permits the efficient phosphorylation and subsequent metabolism of glucose even when tissue concentrations of glucose are low (Fig. 8.13). However, because these isozymes have a low maximal velocity ([Vmax] see p. 57) for glucose, they do not sequester (trap) cellular phosphate in the form of phosphorylated glucose or phosphorylate more glucose than the cell can use. [Note: These isozymes have broad substrate specificity and are able to phosphorylate several hexoses in addition to glucose.] 2. Hexokinase IV: In
Document 3 (Title: Glucokinase): Because of this cooperativity, the kinetic interaction of glucokinase with glucose does not follow classical Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Rather than a Km for glucose, it is more accurate to describe a half-saturation level S0.5, which is the concentration at which the enzyme is 50% saturated and active. The S0.5 and nH extrapolate to an "inflection point" of the curve describing enzyme activity as a function of glucose concentration at about 4 mmol/L. In other words, at a glucose concentration of about 72 mg/dL, which is near the low end of the normal range, glucokinase activity is most sensitive to small changes in glucose concentration.
Document 4 (Title: Abnormal renal glucose handling in X-linked hypophosphataemic mice.): 1. The renal handling of glucose was determined in male X-linked hypophosphataemic (Hyp/Y) mice and in control littermates (+/Y) aged 4 months. Plasma glucose concentration and urinary glucose excretion were measured before and during stepwise increase in glycaemia induced by an acute infusion of glucose. The relationship between plasma glucose concentration and urinary glucose excretion was monitored per ml of glomerular filtrate in mice fed high and low phosphate diets. 2. Hyp/Y mice fed the high phosphate diet showed a significantly higher glucosuria compared with +/Y littermates. When glycaemia was increased, Hyp/Y mice developed frank glucosuria earlier than +/Y animals. In Hyp/Y mice we could not find a threshold below which virtually no glucose was excreted in the urine, whereas this was clearly visible in +/Y mice. These differences persisted in animals fed the low phosphate diet. 3. Using the acute response to the glucoregulatory hormones, glucagon and insulin, administered exogenously, we found that the regulation of plasma glucose concentration did not differ between Hyp/Y and +/Y mice. 4. The significantly lower plasma glucose concentration observed in Hyp/Y as compared with +/Y mice decreased further during fasting. 5. We conclude that the renal reabsorptive capacity for glucose is defective in Hyp/Y mice and their low plasma glucose concentration may be explained by the renal leak. Therefore the X-linked phosphataemic mouse appears not only to be characterized by a defect in renal phosphate and calcium reabsorption but also by an altered glucose reabsorption.
Document 5 (Title: A kinetic method for glucose that is insensitive to variations in temperature and enzyme activity.): We have adapted for glucose determination a new approach to kinetic analyses [Anal. Chem. 50, 1611 (1978)]; it is 50-fold less dependent upon some experimental variables than is a more conventional rate method. Modification of a commercially available hexokinase/glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase reagent system for glucose provides that the rate of production of NADH be first-order in total glucose concentration within about 30 s after sample and reagent are mixed. In the kinetic method, absorbance vs. time data recorded after 30 s and a multiple-linear-regression program are used to compute the absorbance change that would occur if the reaction were monitored to completion. Results demonstrate a linear relationship between glucose concentration and computed absorbance change. Application of the method to 51 human sera without rigorous control of either temperature or reagent composition yielded a regression equation of y = 1.01x -0.3 when kinetic results (y) were compared with equilibrium results (x) for the same samples analyzed in a hospital laboratory.

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
Question: A researcher is studying the properties of an enzyme that adds phosphate groups to glucose. She discovers that the enzyme is present in most body tissues and is located in the cytoplasm of the cells expressing the enzyme. She decides to mix this enzyme under subphysiologic conditions with varying levels of glucose in order to determine the kinetic properties of the enzyme. Specifically, she adds increasing levels of glucose at a saturating concentration of phosphate and sees that the rate at which glucose becomes phosphorylated gets faster at higher levels of glucose. She observes that this rate approaches a maximum speed and calls this speed Y. She then determines the concentration of glucose that is needed to make the enzyme function at half the speed Y and calls this concentration X. Which of the following is most likely true about the properties of this enzyme?
Options:
A. High X and high Y
B. High X and low Y
C. Low X and high Y
D. Low X and low Y
