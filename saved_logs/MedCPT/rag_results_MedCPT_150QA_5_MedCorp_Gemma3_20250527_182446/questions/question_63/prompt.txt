Document 1 (Title: Differential diagnosis): For an individual (who becomes the "patient" in this example), a blood test of, for example, serum calcium shows a result above the standard reference range, which, by most definitions, classifies as hypercalcemia, which becomes the "presentation" in this case. A clinician (who becomes the "diagnostician" in this example), who does not currently see the patient, gets to know about his finding. By practical reasons, the clinician considers that there is enough test indication to have a look at the patient's medical records. For simplicity, let's say that the only information given in the medical records is a family history of primary hyperparathyroidism (here abbreviated as PH), which may explain the finding of hypercalcemia. For this patient, let's say that the resultant hereditary risk factor is estimated to confer a relative risk of 10 (RRPH = 10).
Document 2 (Title: Suicide Risk -- Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes): The only way to prevent suicides is to work in an interprofessional team that includes a mental health nurse, psychiatrist, primary care provider, social worker, and nurse practitioner. Practitioners must work with the patient's family and friends, as well as with the other patients who knew the deceased. The first step is to prevent harm to the patient and, secondly, treat the cause of the behavior that is causing suicidal ideations. All patients with suicidal ideations should be closely monitored. The family should be educated about the potential signs of danger. Unfortunately, in many cases, the healthcare system does fail, as many patients go on to end their lives. [21] [Level 5]
Document 3 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): The expansion of knowledge related to genetics is changing our understanding of pathophysiology and influencing our classification of diseases. Awareness of genetic etiology can have an impact on clinical management, including prevention and screening for or treatment of a range of diseases. Primary care physicians are relied upon to help patients navigate testing and treatment options. Consequently, they must understand the genetic basis for a large number of genetically influenced diseases, incorporate personal and family history to determine the risk for a specific mutation, and be positioned to provide counseling. Even if patients are seen by genetic specialists who assess genetic risk and coordinate testing, primary care providers should provide information to their patients regarding the indications, limitations, risks, and benefits of genetic counseling and testing. They must also be prepared to offer risk-based management following genetic risk assessment. Given the pace of
Document 4 (Title: Family care of the elderly and caregiver stress.): Contrary to the widespread belief that most elderly persons are institutionalized, 95 percent of people over age 65 live at home, and many are cared for, to some extent, by a relative. It has only recently been recognized that the family caregiver is at risk for increased physical and mental morbidity because of this often stressful task. If the situation is too stressful, elder abuse may result. Family physicians are in a good position to identify caregiver stress, recognize the danger signs of elder abuse, provide support, education and advice, and intervene when necessary. Primary care providers should routinely ask about caregiving responsibilities when obtaining the medical history of any patient over age 45.
Document 5 (Title: Promoting prevention services in primary care: a controlled trial.): We used a two-group hybrid, multiple baseline and reversal design to assess the efficacy of a prompt--an in-chart checklist--for increasing screening, counseling, and referral for 11 risk behaviors. Chart reviews for randomly selected patients of each provider showed very low baseline levels of these services for routine visits (0.2% to 3.8%). But significant increases occurred in discussion and prescription of change (although not in referrals) during intervention. Patient visits for routine gynecologic care and birth control showed higher baseline levels (10.8% to 21.0%) and also had a significant increase in discussion of risk behaviors. However, no significant change occurred in prescription or referral for these patients. Follow-up interviews of providers supported the reliability of the results and raised issues about attitudes toward primary care health promotion. Provider variability in response to the intervention suggests that more tailored interventions might increase provision of comprehensive health promotion services by a broad spectrum of primary care providers.
