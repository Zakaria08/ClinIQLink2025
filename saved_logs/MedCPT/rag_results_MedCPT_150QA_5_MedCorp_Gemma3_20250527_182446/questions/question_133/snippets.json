        "title": "Aliskiren (Archived) -- Mechanism of Action",
        "content": "Aliskiren is active in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). [11] Renin\u00a0secretion occurs by specialized cells found in the juxtaglomerular apparatus\u00a0within\u00a0the kidney based on changes in blood volume and renal perfusion as sensed by the macula densa in the distal tubule of the nephron. Renin is responsible for converting angiotensinogen to angiotensin I. Angiotensin I is then converted to angiotensin II by the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), which is present in the lungs' capillaries and endothelial cells in the kidneys. Angiotensin II is believed to be the first active mediator in the RAAS system and exerts its effects by binding to the AT1 receptor and works as a vasoconstrictor, causing the release of catecholamines and promoting aldosterone secretion and sodium reabsorption. These effects together act to increase blood pressure. Angiotensin II\u00a0also\u00a0can inhibit renin release, causing negative feedback to the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.",

        "title": "Why are converting enzyme inhibitors vasodilators?",
        "content": "1. The primary action of the converting enzyme inhibitors to prevent the formation of angiotensin II can explain a decrease in peripheral vascular resistance in patients with elevated, but not in those with normal or reduced plasma renin levels. 2. The inhibition of the breakdown of bradykinin will potentiate the vasodilator properties of the endogenously produced peptide. These include direct relaxation of certain vascular smooth muscle, production of vasodilator prostanoids and release of endothelium-derived relaxing factor(s). The greater release of the latter in the kidney could exert a negative feedback on the release of renin. 3. In addition, converting enzyme inhibitors may directly (by a prejunctional effect) and indirectly (by curtailing the production of angiotensin II) reduce the release of noradrenaline in the blood vessel wall. 4. Converting enzyme inhibitors may also directly reduce the responsiveness of vascular smooth muscle to vasoconstrictor stimuli (e.g. alpha-adrenoceptor activation). 5. The different effects of these therapeutic agents may concur to induce peripheral vasodilatation.",

        "content": "ANF is a peptide hormone with peripheral and central effects on several physiologic control systems, which suggests broad involvement in the regulation of intravascular volume and cardiovascular homeostasis. ANF acts directly on the kidney to modulate renal vascular resistance, increase glomerular filtration rate, and decrease inner medullary hypertonicity. These hemodynamic effects act in concert to promote marked natriuresis and diuresis and to inhibit renin secretion by the kidney; the potential role of direct effects on tubular transport and on the juxtaglomerular cells remains to be clarified. ANF also inhibits steroidogenesis, most prominently affecting agonist-induced aldosterone biosynthesis by the adrenal cortex. ANF exerts a smooth muscle relaxant effect on isolated vessels constricted with various hormonal agonists. ANF causes especially pronounced antagonism of the adrenal and vascular actions of angiotensin II and antagonizes the latter peptide's central nervous system effects. Although complex systemic hemodynamic mechanisms are involved, ANF-induced vasorelaxation may contribute to its depressor action, particularly in states characterized by angiotensin II-induced vasoconstriction. Distention of the atria is a major stimulus to ANF release and evokes many responses that are mimicked by ANF infusion. Although ANF is not the sole or even dominant mediator of the responses to atrial distention, available data suggest that it plays a role in the renal and hormonal responses to intravascular volume expansion. Definitive assessment of its physiologic and pathophysiologic significance must await development of specific antagonists, but further studies on the mechanisms of action of ANF at the molecular, cellular, and systemic levels are likely to contribute significantly to our understanding of the complex process of volume regulation and cardiovascular homeostasis.",
