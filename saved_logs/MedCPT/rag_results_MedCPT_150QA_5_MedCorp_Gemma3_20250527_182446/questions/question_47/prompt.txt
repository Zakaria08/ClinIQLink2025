Document 1 (Title: [Bronchiectasis treated with negative extra-thoracic pressure ventilation].): A 25-year old man with 5-year history of bronchiectasis was admitted to the ICU complaining of severe shortness of breath. He had a respiratory rate of 40 to 50 breath/min. On 0.5 l/min of oxygen with nasal cannula, arterial blood pH was 7.39, Paco2 52.3 mmHg, Pao2 45.0 mmHg. Then, on 1 l/min of oxygen, Pao2 was unchanged, but Paco2 increased to 58 mmHg. As his consciousness was so clear, we applied to him the negative extra-thoracic pressure ventilator which was designed by the authors. Negative extra-thoracic pressure ventilation (NETPV) was maintained at a IMV rate of 30 breath/min, peak negative extra-thoracic pressure of -20 to -30 cmH2O, and an inspiratory/expiratory ratio of 1:2. During NETPV, his respiratory rate and oxygen consumption were decreased and Pao2 was increased compared with his spontaneous breathing. He made a recovery from dyspnea, especially, he was able to take a deep breath. When NETPV was applied to him, pulmonary artery and arterial catheterizations revealed that central venous pressure was slightly decreased, cardiac index unchanged or slightly decreased, heart rate, systemic blood pressure, and pulmonary arterial pressure unchanged compared with spontaneous breathing. The patient was able to read books and maintained communication in his voice with his family and the medical staff. After 3 days of the treatment with NETPV, a marked improvement was noted and the patient was discharged from the ICU. NETPV has the benefits as follows. First, it is very easy for both a patient and a doctor to assist his breathing because an endotracheal intubation is not necessary.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Document 2 (Title: Case Study: 32-Year-Old Male Presenting with Right Lower Quadrant Abdominal Pain (Archived) -- Case Presentation): The patient denies prior abdominal surgeries. He does smoke a half pack of cigarettes a day, drinks alcohol socially, and denies any recreational drug use. He notes no inherited medical conditions in his family. Vital signs on arrival: Blood pressure (BP) 120/73 Heart rate (HR) 60 RR 18 Temperature: 35.6 C Oxygen saturation: 98% on room air Height 5'10" (178 cm) Weight 154 lbs (70 kg)
Document 3 (Title: Alveolar–arterial gradient): Because A–a gradient is approximated as: (150 − 5/4(P)) – at sea level and on room air (0.21x(760-47) = 149.7 mmHg for the alveolar oxygen partial pressure, after accounting for the water vapor), the direct mathematical cause of a large value is that the blood has a low , a low Pa, or both. is very easily exchanged in the lungs and low Pa directly correlates with high minute ventilation; therefore a low arterial Pa indicates that extra respiratory effort is being used to oxygenate the blood. A low indicates that the patient's current minute ventilation (whether high or normal) is not enough to allow adequate oxygen diffusion into the blood. Therefore, the A–a gradient essentially demonstrates a high respiratory effort (low arterial Pa) relative to the achieved level of oxygenation (arterial ). A high A–a gradient could indicate a patient breathing hard to achieve normal oxygenation, a patient breathing normally and attaining low oxygenation, or a patient breathing hard and still
Document 4 (Title: Anatomy_Gray): A 53-year-old man presented to the emergency department with a 5-hour history of sharp pleuritic chest pain and shortness of breath. The day before he was on a long haul flight, returning from his holidays. He was usually fit and well and was a keen mountain climber. He had no previous significant medical history. On physical examination his lungs were clear, he was tachypneic at 24/min, and his saturation was reduced to 92% on room air. Pulmonary embolism was suspected and the patient was referred for a CT pulmonary angiogram. The study demonstrated clots within the right and left main pulmonary arteries. There was no pleural effusion, lung collapse, or consolidation. He was immediately started on subcutaneous enoxaparin and converted to oral anticoagulation over the course of a couple of days. The whole treatment lasted 6 months as no other risk factors (except immobilization during a long haul flight) were identified. There were no permanent sequelae.
Document 5 (Title: Neurology_Adams): 1. Shallow and irregular respirations, stertorous breathing (indicating obstruction to inspiration), and cyanosis require the establishment of a clear airway and delivery of oxygen. The patient should initially be placed in a lateral position so that secretions and vomitus do not enter the tracheobronchial tree. Secretions and vomitus should be removed by suctioning as soon as they accumulate; otherwise they will lead to atelectasis and bronchopneumonia. Arterial blood gases should be measured and further observed by monitoring of oxygen saturation. A patient’s inability to protect against aspiration and the presence of either hypoxia or hypoventilation dictate the use of endotracheal intubation and a positive-pressure respirator. 2. The management of shock, if present, takes precedence over all other diagnostic and therapeutic measures.

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
Question: A 21-year-old man presents to the emergency department after sustaining a stab wound to the neck at a local farmer's market. The patient is otherwise healthy and is complaining of pain. The patient is able to offer the history himself. His temperature is 97.6°F (36.4°C), blood pressure is 120/84 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam demonstrates a 3 cm laceration 1 cm inferior to the mastoid process on the right side. The patient's breath sounds are clear and he is protecting his airway. No stridor or difficulty breathing is noted. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient?
Options:
A. CT angiogram
B. Intubation
C. Observation and blood pressure monitoring
D. Surgical exploration
