Document 1 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Nomograms To better assess risk and guide treatment selection, many groups have developed prognostic models or nomograms that use a combination of the initial clinical T stage, biopsy Gleason score, and baseline PSA. Some use discrete cut points (PSA <10 or ≥10 ng/mL; Gleason score of ≤6, 7, or ≥8); others employ nomograms that use PSA and Gleason score as continuous variables. More than 100 nomograms have been reported to predict the probability that a clinically significant prostate cancer is present, disease extent (organ-confined vs non–organ-confined, node-negative or -positive), or the probability of success of treatment for specific local therapies using pretreatment variables. Considerable controversy exists over what constitutes “high risk” based on a predicted probability of success or failure. In these situations, nomograms and predictive models can only go so far. Exactly what probability of success or failure would lead a physician to recommend and a patient to seek
Document 2 (Title: Prostate cancer): The D'Amico classification stratifies men by low, intermediate, or high risk based on stage, grade and PSA. It is used widely in clinical practice and research settings. The major downside to the three-level system is that it does not account for multiple adverse parameters (e.g., high Gleason score and high PSA) in stratifying patients. The Partin tables predict pathologic outcomes (margin status, extraprostatic extension, and seminal vesicle invasion) based on the same three variables and are published as lookup tables. The Kattan nomograms predict recurrence after surgery and/or radiation therapy, based on data available at the time of diagnosis or after surgery. The Kattan score represents the likelihood of remaining free of disease at a given time interval following treatment.
Document 3 (Title: The use of prostate specific antigen density to enhance the predictive value of intermediate levels of serum prostate specific antigen.): Prostate specific antigen (PSA) is an extremely valuable tumor marker. However, its use in detection is limited by its low positive and negative predictive values. The ability of serum PSA to distinguish between benign and malignant prostatic conditions is particularly poor in the intermediate range of 4.1 and 10 ng./ml. by the Hybritech assay. We used transrectal ultrasound determined prostate volumes in a well characterized population of 533 men to form a serum PSA/prostate volume ratio called prostate specific antigen density (PSAD). The prevalence of cancer in the entire population was 18.4%. Discriminant analysis according to negative or positive outcome allowed for the construction of nomograms, which resulted in a PSAD defined cancer risk ranging from 3 to 100%. Predictive value nomograms created from PSAD may allow for a more individualized approach to evaluation of patients with intermediate levels of Hybritech serum PSA.
Document 4 (Title: Flow cytometry as a predictive modality in prostate cancer.): Clinical staging and histologic grading do not have sufficient predictive value to determine the response to therapy of any given prostate cancer. A review of the findings from the largest prospective study of patients with localized and locally advanced prostate cancer and from retrospective flow cytometric studies of specific disease stages suggests that DNA flow cytometry offers additional prognostic information for this disease. However, for the individual patient, this added information may have limited value, since approximately 15% of those with diploid disease will experience disease progression within 5 years as compared with half of those with nondiploid disease. We have found that ploidy does not predict length of survival once prostate cancer becomes disseminated, nor does it predict those who will benefit from receiving definitive radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer. On the other hand, for those who have persistent tumor, we have frequently found increased ploidy abnormalities in the tumor sampled after radiation therapy and are currently correlating this finding with clinical outcome. We have also found that DNA flow cytometry can be used to predict tumor volume. For larger, grade-matched diploid tumors, there are significant increases in the proliferation of both the tumor and the adjacent benign tissue, which we take to be evidence of "field effects" in this disease. An even more obvious manifestation of the same phenomenon is seen in the occurrence of aneuploidy in benign tissue near high-grade, large-volume prostate cancer. It is concluded that DNA flow cytometry has much to tell us about the natural history and biologic behavior of prostate cancer.
Document 5 (Title: Prostate Cancer Tissue-Based Biomarkers -- Diagnostic Tests -- Tissue-Based Biomarkers): The Prolaris prostate cancer prognostic test is used in two clinical scenarios: newly diagnosed patients with prostate cancer (Prolaris biopsy test) and after radical prostatectomy (Prolaris post-prostatectomy test). Results are given as Cell Cycle Progression (CCP) scores of 0 to 6. The clinical endpoint is the 10-year risk of prostate cancer-specific mortality as well as the 10-year risk of biochemical recurrence (BCR) after radical prostatectomy. [51] [52] [53]
