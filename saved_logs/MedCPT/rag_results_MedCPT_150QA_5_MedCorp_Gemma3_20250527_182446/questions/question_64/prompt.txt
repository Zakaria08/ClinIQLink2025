Document 1 (Title: Sonography Physical Principles And Instrumentation -- Clinical Significance): Outside of ultrasound technician training, medical residents and fellows study ultrasound. Specifically, cardiology fellows focus on the cardiac application, nephrology on renal images, and formal fellowships for using ultrasound for emergency medicine residents and attendings. Lastly, radiology residency has formal training in obtaining and interpreting sonographic images. [9]
Document 2 (Title: Emergency ultrasound): Training Emergency and point-of-care ultrasound is taught in a variety of settings. Many physicians are currently taught bedside ultrasound during the emergency medicine residency or critical care fellowship training programs in the United States. It can also be learned as part of the continuing education process, through formal didactics, one-on-one training, training software, and clinical application and practice. Other specialists may learn during their residency or fellowship training programs. There are specialized fellowship training programs for bedside ultrasound in emergency medicine, but these are not required nor expected for the use of this tool in practice. Training has been expanded to other specialties in medical and surgical fields and is expected to expand in the future.

Document 3 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Whereas typical echocardiographic equipment is large, bulky, and expensive, small hand-held ultrasound equipment developed over the last decade now offers diagnostic quality imaging in a package small enough to be carried on rounds (Fig. 270e-4). These relatively inexpensive point-of-care devices currently lack full diagnostic capabilities but represent an excellent screening tool if used by an experienced operator. As these units become even smaller and less expensive, they are being increasingly used not just by cardiologists, but also by emergency medicine physicians, intensivists, anesthesiologists, and internists. Radionuclide imaging techniques are commonly used for the evaluation of patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease (CAD),
Document 4 (Title: Objectives to direct the training of emergency medicine residents on off-service rotations; radiologic imaging 2: contrast and imaging techniques.): Interpretation of radiologic images is an essential skill for the emergency physician. This is the second of two sets of objectives for an off-service rotation in radiology. The first covered the interpretation of plain films. This series addresses commonly used imaging modalities such as contrast media, ultrasound, computed tomography, nuclear medicine, and magnetic resonance imaging. This set of objectives may be used to guide a one-month radiology rotation or to serve as part of a teaching program integrated with didactic training and emergency department experience.
