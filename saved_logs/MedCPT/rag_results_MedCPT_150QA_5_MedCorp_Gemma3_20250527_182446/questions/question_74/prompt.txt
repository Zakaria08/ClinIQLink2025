With your own knowledge and the help of the following document:

Document 1 (Title: Neurology_Adams): Facial pain of the “atypical type,” like other chronic pain of indeterminate cause, requires close observation of the patient, looking for lesions such as nasopharyngeal carcinoma or apical lung carcinoma to become apparent. The pain can be managed by the conservative methods outlined in the preceding chapter and not by destructive surgery. Antidepressants may be helpful, especially if the patient displays obsessive characteristics in relation to the pain; some European neurologists favor clomipramine for various facial and scalp pains. Other Rare Types of Facial Pain
Document 2 (Title: Oro-facial pain.): Oro-facial pain is commonly acute, and of dental origin. There are numerous other less common, but clinically identifiable types of oro-facial pain which can be attributed to an organic cause, and which usually respond to the appropriate treatment. There is a small proportion of oro-facial pain problems, however, which are chronic and which are found to have a psychogenic element of greater or lesser magnitude, and treatment is aimed at psychological or psychiatric therapy. The interim results of an ongoing study of chronic oro-facial pain of psychogenic origin are described in this presentation.
Document 3 (Title: Dystonia -- History and Physical): Oro-mandibular dystonia can manifest as night-time bruxism (jaw spasms producing forceful jaw closure) and may follow dental procedures, oro-mandibular-facial trauma, or temporomandibular joint dysfunction.
Document 4 (Title: Burning mouth syndrome): Some consider BMS to be a variant of atypical facial pain. More recently, BMS has been described as one of the 4 recognizable symptom complexes of chronic facial pain, along with atypical facial pain, temporomandibular joint dysfunction and atypical odontalgia. BMS has been subdivided into three general types, with type two being the most common and type three being the least common. Types one and two have unremitting symptoms, whereas type three may show remitting symptoms. Type 1 - Symptoms not present upon waking, and then increase throughout the day Type 2 - Symptoms upon waking and through the day Type 3 - No regular pattern of symptoms Sometimes those terms specific to the tongue (e.g. glossodynia'') are reserved for when the burning sensation is located only on the tongue.
Document 5 (Title: Temporomandibular joint dysfunction): Classification TMD is considered by some to be one of the 4 major symptom complexes in chronic orofacial pain, along with burning mouth syndrome, atypical facial pain and atypical odontalgia. TMD has been considered as a type of musculoskeletal, neuromuscular, or rheumatological disorder. It has also been called a functional pain syndrome, and a psychogenic disorder. Others consider TMD a "central sensitivity syndrome", in reference to evidence that TMD might be caused by a centrally mediated sensitivity to pain. It is hypothesized that there is a great deal of similarity between TMD and other pain syndromes like fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome, interstitial cystitis, headache, chronic lower back pain and chronic neck pain. These disorders have also been theorized to be caused by centrally mediated sensitivity to pain, and furthermore they often occur together.
