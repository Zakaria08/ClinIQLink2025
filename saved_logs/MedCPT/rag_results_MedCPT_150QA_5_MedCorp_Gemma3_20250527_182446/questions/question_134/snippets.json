        "title": "[Complications of nephrotic syndrome with special reference to thromboembolic accidents].",
        "content": "The nephrotic syndrome may be associated with several complications caused by severe proteinuria. The consequences of severe renal protein loss are disturbances of water and electrolyte metabolism, thromboses and thromboembolic complications, hyperlipidemia with accelerated atherosclerosis and, finally, some other complications due to the decreased oncotic pressure and the renal loss of transport globulins and immunoglobulins. Diagnosis and treatment of these complications are important in the management of patients with nephrotic syndrome. In the present study, the frequency and localization of thromboses and thromboembolic complications in 11 patients with nephrotic syndrome are described. In addition, factors which are known to be responsible for the hypercoagulable state in nephrotic syndrome were evaluated and correlated to the thromboembolic complications in these patients. An important finding was that in all patients with thromboses and thromboembolic complications, the serum albumin concentrations were below 2 g/100 ml, whereas, with one exception, serum albumin levels were above 2 g/100 ml in cases without thromboembolic complications. Our results indicate that serum albumin levels may be used as an indirect parameter to assess the risk of thromboembolic complications in patients with nephrotic syndrome.",

        "content": "Signs and symptoms Historically, nephritic syndrome has been characterized by blood in the urine (hematuria), high blood pressure (hypertension), decreased urine output <400 ml/day (oliguria), red blood cell casts, pyuria, and mild to moderate proteinuria. If the condition is allowed to progress without treatment, it can eventually lead to azotemia and uremic symptoms. This constellation of symptoms contrasts with the classical presentation of nephrotic syndrome (excessive proteinuria >3.5 g/day, low plasma albumin levels (hypoalbuminemia) <3 g/L, generalized edema, and hyperlipidemia).",

The main value of protein electrophoresis in a patient with low serum albumin is with the differential diagnosis of hypoalbuminemia. In the presence of acute inflammation, hypoalbuminemia will be present with an increase in alpha-1 and 2 globulins and normal gamma globulins. In chronic inflammation, the protein electrophoresis pattern will show hypoalbuminemia with a polyclonal increase in gamma globulins.",

        "title": "Minimal change disease",
        "content": "Minimal change disease (also known as MCD, minimal change glomerulopathy, and nil disease, among others) is a disease affecting the kidneys which causes a nephrotic syndrome. Nephrotic syndrome leads to the loss of significant amounts of protein in the urine, which causes the widespread edema (soft tissue swelling) and impaired kidney function commonly experienced by those affected by the disease. It is most common in children and has a peak incidence at 2 to 6 years of age. MCD is responsible for 10-25% of nephrotic syndrome cases in adults. It is also the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome of unclear cause (idiopathic) in children. Signs and symptoms The clinical signs of minimal change disease are proteinuria (abnormal excretion of proteins, mainly albumin, into the urine), edema (swelling of soft tissues as a consequence of water retention), weight gain, and hypoalbuminaemia (low serum albumin). These signs are referred to collectively as nephrotic syndrome.",
