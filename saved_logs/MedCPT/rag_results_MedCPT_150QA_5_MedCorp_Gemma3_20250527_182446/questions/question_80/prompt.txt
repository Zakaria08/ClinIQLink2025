Document 1 (Title: First_Aid_Step2): B High-Yield Surgery NIRULA Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, 2005, 2nd ed., 160 pages, ISBN 9780781776561 An outline review of most common general surgery topics. Pros: Con-cise; useful for quick topic review. Well organized. Cons: Information can be superficial. Some topics are omitted. Offers no practice ques-tions. Summary: A lean text for rapid review. $26.95 Review B A&L’s Review of Surgery WAPNICK McGraw-Hill, 2003, 4th ed., 320 pages, ISBN 9780071378147 A general review of surgery with questions and answers. Pros: Good clinical emphasis. Includes many vignette-style questions. Explana-tions are thorough. Cons: Some questions are too short, and the style does not reﬂect that of the Step 2 CK exam. Questions are highly vari-able in difficulty and are often far too detailed. Offers few illustrations. Summary: Good content for the exam, but much too detailed for clerkship and Step 2 CK review. $34.95 Test/1000+ q B−Surgical Recall BLACKBOURNE Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, 2008, 5th
Document 2 (Title: Past Present and Future of Simulation in Internal Medicine -- Clinical Clerkships): As internal medicine residents rotate through their clinical clerkships, simulation can be used to prepare them for the experience, assess if objectives of the rotation are met, and remediate if they are not. As an example, at the Mayo Clinic Internal Medicine Program in Florida, residents start their critical care rotation with a day of “boot camp” in the simulation center. During this time, they receive instruction in sterile technique for gowning and gloving, placement of central lines under ultrasound guidance, and practice ventilation and intubation. Further simulated practice occurs during the emergency medicine rotation, which includes learning the management of medical emergencies such as hyperkalemia, pneumothorax, and gastrointestinal bleed and procedural skills such as ultrasound (e.g., FAST exam), abscess drainage and placing chest tubes. Dedicated practice like this enhances patient safety. [5] The simulation center is also used to assess competency periodically during the three years of residency, and simulations are specifically designed to remediate residents when necessary. Residents are encouraged to self-direct their learning and return to the simulation center for further practice.
Document 3 (Title: Influence of clerkship structure and timing on individual student performance.): Student oral and written surgical clerkship performances may be related to the clerkship structure and the time of year the students rotate through the clerkship. The influence of calendar block, hospital site (university hospital, affiliated private tertiary-care hospital, and rural preceptor experience), and the mix of general surgical versus subspeciality rotations on oral and written student surgery clerkship scores was analyzed. Multivariate analysis of variance revealed significant differences in score for calendar block (p = 0.02) only; this difference resided in the written examination. The various combinations of rotations were not different from one another in terms of measured outcome.
Document 4 (Title: Medical school in the United States): The third and fourth years consist of clinical rotations, sometimes called clerkships, where students see patients in hospitals and clinics. These rotations are usually at teaching hospitals but are occasionally at community hospitals or with private physicians. Mandatory rotations in third year are often obstetrics and gynecology, pediatrics, psychiatry, family medicine, internal medicine, and surgery. During the third year, medical students take Step 2/Level 2 of the medical licensing boards. Fourth year rotations typically allow students to choose several electives and finish required rotations. It is also used as a period of auditioning for residency programs.
Document 5 (Title: Development of competence in clerkship.): Students' perceptions of their educational experience on Surgery and Medicine rotations of a clerkship program were analysed. Six components of the education process, namely (1) frequency of individual teaching, (2) quality of contact with staff-clinicians, (3) appropriateness of responsibility for patient care, (4) appropriateness of supervision received, (5) frequency of admissions reviewed and (6) frequency of opportunity to follow-up patients admitted, were correlated with students' confidence in their ability to function competently. Mean scores of clerks' confidence in their competence was the same for both rotations. Breakdown by sex revealed females to feel more competent on medicine, and males on surgery. On the medicine rotation a moderate relationship was found between two of the components tested and the dependent variable; on surgery, strong correlations were found between four of the components tested and the dependent variable. Regression analysis demonstrated appropriateness of responsibility for patient care to have a low predictor value for achievement of competence on medicine, while quality of contact with staff-clinician and appropriateness of supervision received were strong predictors of achievement of competence on the surgery rotation.
