Document 1 (Title: Liver Transplantation -- Technique or Treatment): Living Donor Liver Transplantation (LDLT): In the past, living donors were only used in pediatric cases that require liver transplantation. Due to the increasing numbers of patients requiring liver transplantation and the shortage of deceased donors, living donors are also used in adults. LT from living donors is more complex and requires much careful dissection. [68] Living donor graft is partial, unlike the whole graft provided from a deceased donor. A living donor graft has a noticeably smaller hepatic artery, hepatic vein, and portal vein, which needs to be implanted, so the most crucial part is to make adequate room by incising the hepatic vein along the sides to ensure adequate sources for arterial hepatic, portal, and biliary reconstruction. [69]
Document 2 (Title: Liver transplantation): Complications Living donor surgery is done at a major center. Very few individuals require any blood transfusions during or after surgery. All potential donors should know there is a 0.5 to 1.0 percent chance of death. Other risks of donating a liver include bleeding, infection, painful incision, possibility of blood clots and a prolonged recovery. The vast majority of donors enjoy complete and full recovery within 2–3 months. Pediatric transplantation In children, living liver donor transplantation has become very accepted. The accessibility of adult parents who want to donate a piece of the liver for their children/infants has reduced the number of children who would have otherwise died waiting for a transplant. Having a parent as a donor also has made it a lot easier for children – because both patients are in the same hospital and can help boost each other's morale.
Document 3 (Title: Liver transplantation: living-related donations.): The LRLT procedure appears to be a promising alternative and adjunct to conventional liver transplantation. The advantages to this technique are a donor for each recipient, an improved quality of graft, and a reduction in pretransplant mortality in children. The procedure is not without risks, but the overall benefits seem to outweigh these risks, and only future experience will tell otherwise. Will there continue to be a need for such a procedure? We believe there will be, because the number of candidates needing transplantation will continue to grow and the demand for cadaveric organs will never be met. However, the procedure is extremely labor and resource intensive, and it is our belief that only a handful of large major medical centers will be able to adopt a live-donor program.
Document 4 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Occasionally, especially for liver transplantation in children, one cadaver organ can be split between two recipients (one adult and one child). A more viable alternative, transplantation of the right lobe of the liver from a healthy adult donor into an adult recipient, has gained increased popularity. Living donor transplantation of the left lobe (left lateral segment), introduced in the early 1990s to alleviate the extreme shortage of donor organs for small children, accounts currently for approximately one-third of all liver transplantation procedures in children. Driven by the shortage of cadaver organs, living donor transplantation involving the more sizable right lobe is being considered with increasing frequency in adults; however, living donor liver transplantation cannot be expected to solve the donor organ shortage; 246 such procedures were done in 2012, representing only about 4% of all liver transplant operations done in the United States.
Document 5 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): As noted above, emerging alternatives to orthotopic liver transplantation include split-liver grafts, in which one donor organ is divided and inserted into two recipients; and living donor procedures, in which part of the left (for children), the left (for children or small adults), or the right (for adults) lobe of the liver is harvested from a living donor for transplantation into the recipient. In the adult procedure, once the right lobe is removed from the donor, the donor right hepatic vein is anastomosed to the recipient right hepatic vein remnant, followed by donor-to-recipient anastomoses of the portal vein and then the hepatic artery. Finally, the biliary anastomosis is performed, duct-to-duct if practical or via Roux-en-Y anastomosis. Heterotopic liver transplantation, in which the donor liver is inserted without removal of the native liver, has met with very limited success and acceptance, except in a very small number of centers.
