        "content": "History of Present Illness: A 33-year-old\u00a0white female presents after admission to the general medical/surgical hospital ward with a chief complaint of shortness of breath on exertion. She reports that she was seen for similar symptoms previously at her primary care physician\u2019s office six months ago.\u00a0At that time, she was diagnosed with acute bronchitis and treated with bronchodilators, empiric antibiotics, and a short course oral steroid taper. This management did not improve her symptoms, and she has gradually worsened over six months. She reports a 20-pound (9 kg) intentional weight loss over the past year. She denies camping, spelunking, or hunting activities. She denies any sick contacts. A brief review of systems is negative for fever, night sweats, palpitations, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, neural sensation changes, muscular changes, and increased bruising or bleeding. She admits a cough, shortness of breath, and shortness of breath on exertion.",

        "content": "A case history of a 25-year-old female is reported. She had no diseases predisposing for pancreatic disease. A few days after a familial outbreak of yersinia enteritis, she again became ill and was referred to hospital. Clinical and laboratory examination made it likely that she underwent an acute pancreatic affection, and the serological test proved that she had been through an acute yersiniosis. The coincidental occurrence may of course be by change, but considering the immunological aspects of secondary yersiniosis, there might also be an etiological link.",

In a small group of patients chronic pancreatitis has been shown to be hereditary. Almost all patients with cystic fibrosis have established chronic pancreatitis, usually from birth. Cystic fibrosis gene mutations have also been identified in patients with chronic pancreatitis but in whom there were no other manifestations of cystic fibrosis. Obstruction of the pancreatic duct because of either a benign or malignant process may result in chronic pancreatitis. Pathophysiology",

        "content": "Onset symptoms, including frequent infections, may occur during adolescence, however, for many patients, the symptoms and diagnosis may not occur until adulthood. People with common variable immunodeficiency have trouble fighting off infections due to the lack of antibodies produced which normally resit invading microbes. Due to impaired antibody development vaccines are not effective. Recurring bacterial infections are generally found in the upper and lower areas of the respiratory tract. Many who have a recurring lung infection, report developing, chronic lung diseases, and potentially life-threatening complications later in life. Causes The underlying causes of CVID are largely obscure. Genetic mutations can be identified as the cause of disease in about 10% of people, while familial inheritance accounts for 10-25% of cases. Rather than arising from a single genetic mutation, CVID seems to result from variety of mutations that all contribute to a failure in antibody production.",
