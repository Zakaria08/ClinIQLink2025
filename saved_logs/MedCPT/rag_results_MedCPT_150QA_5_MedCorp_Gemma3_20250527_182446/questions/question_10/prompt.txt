Document 1 (Title: Decongestant): A decongestant, or nasal decongestant, is a type of pharmaceutical drug that is used to relieve nasal congestion in the upper respiratory tract. The active ingredient in most decongestants is either pseudoephedrine or phenylephrine (the latter of which has disputed effectiveness). Intranasal corticosteroids can also be used as decongestants and antihistamines can be used to alleviate runny nose, nasal itch, and sneezing. Topical decongestants on topical application as dilute solution (0.05–0.1%) produce local vasoconstriction. Regular use of decongestants for long periods should be avoided because mucosal ciliary function is impaired: atrophic rhinitis and anosmia (loss of the sense of smell) can occur due to persistent vasoconstriction.
Document 2 (Title: Pediatrics_Nelson): Decongestants, taken orally or intranasally, may be used to relieve nasal congestion. Oral medications, such as pseudoephedrine and phenylephrine, are available either alone or in combination with antihistamines. Adverse effects of oral decongestants include insomnia, nervousness, irritability, tachycardia, tremors, and palpitations. For older children participating in sports, oral decongestant use may be restricted. Topical nasal decongestant sprays are effective for immediate relief of nasal obstruction but should be used for less than 5 to 7 days to prevent rebound nasal congestion (rhinitis medicamentosa). Topical ipratropium bromide, an anticholinergic nasalspray, is used primarily for nonallergic rhinitis and rhinitis associated with viral upper respiratory infection. Leukotrienemodifiers have been studied in the treatment of allergic rhinitis. Montelukast is approved for use in seasonal allergicrhinitis.
Document 3 (Title: New directions and dimensions in the treatment of allergic rhinitis.): Physicians who treat patients with allergic rhinitis have a number of therapeutic options, including antihistamines, decongestants, cromolyn, anticholinergics, corticosteroids, and immunotherapy. Antihistamines are widely used for the treatment of mild allergic rhinitis and are often effective, although more severe cases will require other medications. The newer antihistamines may induce less drowsiness, which is the most prominent side effect of the older antihistamines. Topical nasal decongestants give fast relief from nasal congestion, but their overuse may result in rebound congestion. Because their efficacy in allergic rhinitis is variable, oral decongestants are usually used in combination with antihistamines. Nasal cromolyn is effective for many patients with allergic rhinitis, but its effect is variable and it is useful in severe allergic rhinitis.
Document 4 (Title: Rhinitis Medicamentosa -- Introduction): Topical decongestants are typically used in the relief of nasal congestion due to allergic rhinitis, acute or chronic rhinosinusitis, nasal polyps, or upper respiratory tract infection. The earliest nasal decongestants mainly derived from ephedrine, where there were reports of rebound congestion after prolonged use. This situation was found to develop as early as 3 days and up to 4 to 6 weeks of use. [1] However, with the emergence of modern vasoconstrictors, such as the imidazoline derivatives, the risk of developing RM is considered to be small or non-existent.
Document 5 (Title: Rhinitis Medicamentosa -- Treatment / Management): The treatment of RM involves the discontinuation of the topical decongestant. Patients must receive counsel that the nasal congestion may temporarily worsen upon discontinuation of the topical decongestant so that they do not perceive it as treatment failure. The use of intranasal corticosteroids has been reported to minimize the symptoms of rebound congestion in both animal studies and several small human trials. [2] Other treatment modalities during withdrawal period involve the use of short-course oral corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone, 0.5 mg per kg for five days), oral antihistamines and inferior turbinate steroid injections, oral adenosine and mast cell stabilizing agents; however, these recommendations are based on limited case reports. [2]
