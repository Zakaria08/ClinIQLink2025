        "content": "A number of new acyl and imidoderivatives of 2-amino-4-p-chlorophenylthiazole-5-acetic acid (II) and its methyl ester (VII) were synthesized. Methyl ester VII heated in benzene solution with acid anhydrides was transformed into adequate acyl derivatives (VIII, IX, X, XIII, XVI). Some of them (X, XIII, XVII) by heating with acetic anhydride underwent cyclization and were transformed into the imido derivatives (XI, XIV, XVIII). Compounds XI, XIV and XVI heated with diluted aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide underwent selective hydrolysis giving the respective dicarboxylic acids XII, XV, XVII. Pharmacological analysis revealed that some of the synthesized preparations exert an anti-inflammatory effect and allow to draw limited relations between chemical structure and pharmacological activity in this group of compounds.",

        "content": "B. Buffers A buffer is a solution that resists change in pH following the addition of an acid or base. A buffer can be created by mixing a weak acid (HA) with its conjugate base (A\u2212). If an acid such as HCl is added to a buffer, A\u2212 can neutralize it, being converted to HA in the process. If a base is added, HA can likewise neutralize it, being converted to A\u2212 in the process. Maximum buffering capacity occurs at a pH equal to the pKa, but a conjugate acid-base pair can still serve as an effective buffer when the pH of a solution is within approximately \u00b11 pH unit of the pKa. If the amounts of HA and A\u2212 are equal, the pH is equal to the pKa. As shown in Figure 1.9, a solution containing acetic acid (HA = CH3 \u2013 COOH) and acetate (A\u2212 = CH3 \u2013 COO\u2212) with a pKa of 4.8 resists a change in pH from pH 3.8 to 5.8, with maximum buffering at pH 4.8. At pH values less than the pKa, the protonated acid form (CH3 \u2013 COOH) is the predominant species in solution.",
