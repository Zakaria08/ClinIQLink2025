Document 1 (Title: Effective integration of pain management into comprehensive cancer care.): Pain management is an integral component of comprehensive cancer care. The combined goals of optimal comfort and optimal function require a working understanding of how pain therapy interacts with cancer and cancer therapy. The two main aspects of cancer which affect pain management are the cancer's treatability and its non-pain pathophysiology. Cancer treatability determines the importance of pain management and the appropriateness of invasive pain-blocking procedures. Cancer non-pain pathophysiology often hinders pain control by preventing oral administration of medications, narrowing a patient's therapeutic window for opioid analgesics, limiting psychological therapies, and interfering with invasive pain relieving procedures. Cancer therapy can impair or enhance pain therapy and vice versa. Cancer therapy can impair pain therapy by its production of adverse effects or by its direct causation of pain. Cancer therapy can enhance pain therapy by reducing the amount of cancer, by including drugs which act as coanalgesics, and by providing intravenous access devices for parenteral opioid administration. Pain therapy can impair cancer therapy by augmenting or complicating cancer therapy's adverse effects. Pain therapy can enhance cancer therapy by improving organ function and patient performance status permitting previously limited or contraindicated cancer therapies to be given. Five case studies are presented to illustrate how effective integration of pain management into comprehensive cancer care is mandatory for optimal care of cancer patients and their families.
Document 2 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): The pain associated with cancer and other terminal illnesses must be treated aggressively and often requires a multidisciplinary approach for effective management. Such conditions may require continuous use of potent opioid analgesics and are associated with some degree of tolerance and dependence. However, this should not be used as a barrier to providing patients with the best possible care and quality of life. The World Health Organization Ladder (see http:// www.who.int/cancer/palliative/painladder/en/) was created in 1986 to promote awareness of the optimal treatment of pain for individuals with cancer and has helped improve pain care for cancer patients worldwide. Research in the hospice setting has also demonstrated that fixed-interval administration of opioid medication (ie, a regular dose at a scheduled time) is more effective in achieving pain relief than dosing on demand. New dosage forms of opioids that allow slower release of the drug are now available, eg,
Document 3 (Title: Shortness of breath): Palliative medicine Systemic immediate release opioids are beneficial in emergently reducing the symptom of shortness of breath due to both cancer and non cancer causes; long-acting/sustained-release opioids are also used to prevent/continue treatment of dyspnea in palliative setting. There is a lack of evidence to recommend midazolam, nebulised opioids, the use of gas mixtures, or cognitive-behavioral therapy. Non-pharmacological techniques Non-pharmacological interventions provide key tools for the management of breathlessness. Potentially beneficial approaches include active management of psychosocial issues (anxiety, depression, etc.), and implementation of self-management strategies, such as physical and mental relaxation techniques, pacing techniques, energy conservation techniques, learning exercises to control breathing, and education. The use of a fan may also be beneficial. Cognitive behavioural therapy may also be helpful.
Document 4 (Title: The Importance of Cultural Competence in Pain and Palliative Care -- Introduction): Palliative care, focusing on symptom control and comfort measures, relieves suffering in patients with life-threatening illnesses and maximizes their quality of life. Palliative care may be necessary for patients diagnosed with cancer, degenerative neurologic diseases, painful neurologic diseases, and those diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease to relieve symptoms of breathlessness. Hospice or end-of-life palliative care is often provided to dying patients, particularly during the final months of life.
Document 5 (Title: Shortness of breath): Pharmacological treatment For people with severe, chronic, or uncontrollable breathlessness, non-pharmacological approaches to treating breathlessness may be combined with medication. For people who have cancer that is causing the breathlessness, medications that have been suggested include opioids, benzodiazepines, oxygen, and steroids. Results of recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses found opioids were not necessarily associated with more effectiveness in treatment for patients with advanced cancer. Ensuring that the balance between side effects and adverse effects from medications and potential improvements from medications needs to be carefully considered before prescribing medication. The use of systematic corticosteriods in palliative care for people with cancer is common, however the effectiveness and potential adverse effects of this approach in adults with cancer has not been well studied.
