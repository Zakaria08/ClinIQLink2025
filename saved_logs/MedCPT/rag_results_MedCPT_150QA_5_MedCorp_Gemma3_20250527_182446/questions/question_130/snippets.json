        "content": "The rate constants and equilibrium constants of the individual steps of several enzyme reactions may be determined by the application of rapid reaction methods and isotope techniques. This makes it possible to complement the formalism of the Haldane relation with details of the reaction mechanism. It has been shown that, in several enzyme reactions, steps involving chemical catalysis are fast and have small free-energy changes compared with those of the substrate binding and product dissociation processes. Data are presented in this paper for three enzyme reactions for which different methods have been used to elucidate the kinetic parameters of the elementary steps. For cardiac lactate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.27), absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy have been used to distinguish the step involved in the chemical process from those involved in the formation of the substrate complex and the release of the product. The rate of interconversion between enzyme-bound substrates and products is fast compared with other steps and the equilibrium constant for the process is near unity. Consequently, the difference of standard free energy changes for the formation of the two ternary complexes correspons approximately to the overall free-energy change of the hydrogen transfer reaction. Isotope kinetic techniques can be used to study the reactions of triosephosphate isomerase (EC 5.3.1.1). With this enzyme, the interconversion of enzyme-bound substrate into product is comparable in rate to product dissociation. The reactions of myosin subfragment 1 with ATP, studied by fluorescence spectroscopy and chemical quenching, follow a similar pattern in that the equilibrium constant of the chemical step in which water reacts with protein-bound ATP is 9. In this case, however, there is a remarkably large free-energy change associated with a first-order process involved in the binding of ATP. The possible significance of these results to energy transduction in muscle contraction as well as in the biosynthesis of ATP is discussed.",

(a) Compound Y (a reactant) is in a relatively stable state, and energy is required to convert it to compound X (a product), even though X is at a lower overall energy level than Y. This conversion will not take place, therefore, unless compound Y can acquire enough activation energy (energy a minus energy b) from its surroundings to undergo the reaction that converts it into compound X. This energy may be provided by means of an unusually energetic collision with other molecules. for the reverse reaction, X \u2192 Y, the activation energy will be d more rarely. activation energies are always positive; note, however, that the total energy change for the energetically known: some are capable of speeding up reactions by factors of 1014 or more. Enzymes thereby allow reactions that would not otherwise occur to proceed rapidly at normal temperatures.",

        "content": "Enzymes do not alter or shift the equilibrium of a given reaction but instead affect the free energy required to initiate a conversion, which affects the reaction rate. The energy hump that must be surmounted for a reaction to progress is called the activation energy; this is the highest energy on a reaction diagram. It is the most unstable conformation of the substrate in the reaction. Enzymes generally do not add energy to the reaction but instead lower the transition state energy to require less activation energy.",

A chemical reaction is able to manufacture a high-energy transition state molecule more readily when there is a stabilizing fit within the active site of a catalyst. The binding energy of a reaction is this energy released when favorable interactions between substrate and catalyst occur.

Enzymes increase reaction rates by lowering the energy of the transition state. First, binding forms a low energy enzyme-substrate complex (ES). Second, the enzyme stabilises the transition state such that it requires less energy to achieve compared to the uncatalyzed reaction (ES\u2021).

Enzymes can couple two or more reactions, so that a thermodynamically favorable reaction can be used to \"drive\" a thermodynamically unfavourable one so that the combined energy of the products is lower than the substrates.
