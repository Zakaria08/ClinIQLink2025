Document 1 (Title: Protein primary structure): ubiquitination and SUMOylation Various full-length, folded proteins can be attached at their C-termini to the sidechain ammonium groups of lysines of other proteins. Ubiquitin is the most common of these, and usually signals that the ubiquitin-tagged protein should be degraded. Most of the polypeptide modifications listed above occur post-translationally, i.e., after the protein has been synthesized on the ribosome, typically occurring in the endoplasmic reticulum, a subcellular organelle of the eukaryotic cell. Many other chemical reactions (e.g., cyanylation) have been applied to proteins by chemists, although they are not found in biological systems.
Document 2 (Title: Cell_Biology_Alberts): Figure 6–77 Steps in the creation of a functional protein. As indicated, translation of an mRNA sequence into an amino acid sequence on the ribosome is not the end of the process of forming a protein. To function, the completed polypeptide chain must fold correctly into its three-dimensional conformation, bind any cofactors required, and assemble with its partner protein chains, if any. Noncovalent bond formation drives these changes. As indicated, many proteins also require covalent modifications of selected amino acids. Although the most frequent modifications are protein glycosylation and protein phosphorylation, over 200 different types of covalent modifications are known (see pp. 165–166).
Document 3 (Title: Biochemistry, Amino Acid Synthesis and Degradation -- Molecular Level): The amino acids are linked with their neighbors in a specific order by covalent bonds, also known as peptide bonds. These particular bonds are the amide linkages that form when the amino group reacts with the carboxylate carbon connecting 2 amino acids. The free amino group at 1 end of the polypeptide is typically called the amino-terminal or N-terminal. In contrast, the open carboxyl group at the other end is labeled as the carboxyl-terminal or C-terminal. Protein sequences are written or read from the N-to-C terminal direction. The chains of the amino acids or progression of the amino acids distinguish 1 protein from another exquisitely. The organism's DNA is specific in coding a particular sequence of amino acids. Each protein consists of 1 or more polypeptide chains. Proteins are polymers of 50 or more amino acids, while peptides are shorter amino acid polymers. A protease, which is also known as peptidase or proteinase, is an enzyme that catalyzes proteolysis. This phenomenon is constituted by the breakdown of proteins into smaller polypeptides and, eventually, single amino acids. Proteases cleave the peptide bonds within proteins by hydrolysis, a chemical reaction where the water breaks bonds. Acids, alkalis, or enzymes may be employed to determine protein hydrolysis. [8] [9]
Document 4 (Title: A general method for highly selective cross-linking of unprotected polypeptides via pH-controlled modification of N-terminal alpha-amino groups.): A method is described for the highly selective modification of the alpha-amino groups at the N-termini of unprotected peptides to form stable, modified peptide intermediates which can be covalently coupled to other molecules or to a solid support. Acylation with iodoacetic anhydride at pH 6.0 occurs with 90-98% selectivity for the alpha-amino group, depending on the N-terminal residue (as shown with a series of model hexapeptides containing a competing Lys residue). Although Cys residues must be protected (reversibly or irreversibly) before the anhydride reaction, there are no detectable side reactions of the alpha-amino moiety--of the reagent or of modified peptide--with the side chains of His, Met, or Lys. The reaction works well in denaturants, so that inhibitory effects of noncovalent structure can be minimized. In a second step the iodoacetyl-peptide can be reacted with a thiol group on a protein, on a solid chromatography matrix, on a spectroscopic probe, etc. This is illustrated by reaction of a series of N alpha-iodoacetyl-peptides with murine interferon-gamma, which contains a C-terminal Cys residue. Data are presented which suggest that this iodoacetic anhydride scheme is superior in selectivity for alpha-amino groups to conventional chemical approaches to cross-linking such as use of 2-iminothiolane or N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated carboxylic acid esters. The reaction is ideally suited for modifying peptide fragments, as pure species or as mixtures, derived from proteolytic or chemical fragmentation of proteins. Furthermore, polypeptides synthesized biosynthetically, for example via recombinant DNA techniques, can be cross-linked in this way.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Document 5 (Title: Biochemistry, Primary Protein Structure -- Mechanism -- Post-Translational Modifications): These modifications can occur during any step of the protein’s life. Some modifications occur right after transcription, while other modifications occur after protein folding by chaperones. Below is a list of some modifications that can be added to the side chains of amino acids in the polypeptide chain: Glycosylation- attachment of a carbohydrate group through N-glycosidic or O-glycosidic bonds Lipid Anchors- include acylation (linking with long-chain fatty acids), isoprenylation (linkage of polyisoprene), and GPI anchor (linkage with glycosylphosphatidylinositol, GPI) Acetylation- attachment of acetyl groups (-COCH 3 ) Methylation- attachment of methyl groups (-CH 3 ) Carboxylation- attachment of carboxylic acid groups (-COOH) Hydroxylation- attachment of hydroxy groups (-OH) Phosphorylation- attachment of phosphate residues (-OPO 2 )

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
Question: An investigator is studying the modification of newly formed polypeptides in plated eukaryotic cells. After the polypeptides are released from the ribosome, a chemically-tagged protein attaches covalently to lysine residues on the polypeptide chain, forming a modified polypeptide. When a barrel-shaped complex is added to the cytoplasm, the modified polypeptide lyses, resulting in individual amino acids and the chemically-tagged proteins. Which of the following post-translational modifications has most likely occurred?
Options:
A. Glycosylation
B. Phosphorylation
C. Carboxylation
D. Ubiquitination
