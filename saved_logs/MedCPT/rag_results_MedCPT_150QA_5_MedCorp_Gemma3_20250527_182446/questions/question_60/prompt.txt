Document 1 (Title: Chile): After the military coup in September 1973, the Chilean national police (Carabineros) were incorporated into the Defense Ministry. With the return of democratic government, the police were placed under the operational control of the Interior Ministry but remained under the nominal control of the Defense Ministry. Gen. Gustavo González Jure is the head of the national police force of 40,964 men and women who are responsible for law enforcement, traffic management, narcotics suppression, border control, and counter-terrorism throughout Chile. In 2017, Chile signed the UN treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. Administrative divisions In 1978 Chile was administratively divided into regions, and in 1979 subdivided into provinces and these into communes. In total the country has 16 regions, 56 provinces and 348 communes.
Document 2 (Title: Can road traffic law enforcement permanently reduce the number of accidents?): In this paper it is argued that conventional analyses of road user adaptation to traffic law enforcement, based on parametric rational-choice theory, are flawed. Such analyses only consider road-user actions as a response to enforcement level and penalty size and do not simultaneously consider enforcement as a response to road-user behaviour. If each party is considered a rational agent who adapts to the other's behaviour, the proper way to analyze the outcomes is by the way of game theory. A game-theoretic model is presented and the main implications are: (i) most attempts at enforcing road traffic legislation will not have any lasting effects, either on road-user behaviour or on accidents; (ii) imposing stricter penalties (in the form of higher fines or longer prison sentences) will not affect road-user behaviour; (iii) imposing stricter penalties will reduce the level of enforcement; (iv) implementing automatic traffic surveillance techniques and/or allocating enforcement resources according to a chance mechanism, and not according to police estimates of violation probability, can make enforcement effects last, but both alternatives are difficult to implement. Relevant empirical studies are reviewed, and they seem to support the conclusions arrived at by the game-theoretic model.
Document 3 (Title: EMS Crime Scene Responsibility -- Introduction): With the scene secured and first aid provided, law enforcement must begin to determine the boundaries of the crime scene and secure it, usually using crime-scene tape. Potential witnesses must be identified and secured. Physical evidence must be preserved and undisturbed for a thorough investigation by other responding law enforcement, such as detectives and technicians. With these forensic responsibilities in mind, requests by police officers should generally be accommodated when they do not interfere with a patient's immediate needs, cause a delay in important medical care, or result in the potential deterioration of the patient's condition. EMS providers should explain what expedited medical tasks must be done and how best to accomplish those tasks. Cooperate with requests but advocate for the patient. [1] [2] [3] [4]
Document 4 (Title: Pediatrics_Nelson): Yes No Was the child injured by a parent or caregiver? Report to Child Protective Services Report to police No reporting needed Did the child sustain serious injury or illness as a result of abuse or neglect? Did the child sustain serious injury or illness as a result of abuse or neglect? NoYes Yes No Report to police No further reporting needed Figure 22-5 A, Approach to initiating the civil and criminal investigation of suspected abuse. B, Reporting to Child Protective Services (CPS) or law enforcement or both in child abuse cases. CPS reports are required when a child is injured by a parent, by an adult acting as a parent, or by a caregiver of the child. The police investigate crimes against children committed by any person, including parents or other caregivers. (From Christian CW: Child abuse.
