Document 1 (Title: Reversed-phase chromatography): Stationary phases In the 1970s, most liquid chromatography was performed using a solid support stationary phase (also called a column) containing unmodified silica or alumina resins. This type of technique is now referred to as normal-phase chromatography. Since the stationary phase is hydrophilic in this technique, molecules with hydrophilic properties contained within the mobile phase will have a high affinity for the stationary phase, and therefore will adsorb to the column packing. Hydrophobic molecules experience less of an affinity for the column packing, and will pass through to be eluted and detected first. Elution of the hydrophilic molecules adsorbed to the column packing requires the use of more hydrophilic or more polar solvents in the mobile phase to shift the distribution of the particles in the stationary phase towards that of the mobile phase.
Document 2 (Title: Reverse-phase chromatography of polar biological substances: separation of catechol compounds by high-performance liquid chromatography.): Catecholamines and their metabolites have been separated isocratically by reverse-phase chromatography with aqueous (no organic solvent admixed) eluents. Unlike ion-exchange or ion-pair chromatography, mixtures of both acidic and basic substances can be separated in a single chromatographic run, because the retention is governed by hydrophobic interactions between the nonpolar moiety of the solute molecules and the octadecyl-silica stationary phase. The relative retention values strongly depend on the pH of the eluent, which governs the degree of dissociation of ionogenic solutes. The reproducibility of the results and the stability and efficiency of the chromatographic systems make this approach particularly attractive for use in clinical analysis.
Document 3 (Title: Physiology_Levy): Fig. 16.1 illustrates action potentials found in different cardiac cells. Two main types of action potentials occur in the heart and are depicted. One type, the fast response, occurs in normal atrial and ventricular myocytes and in the specialized conducting fibers (Purkinje fibers of the heart) and is divided into five phases. The rapid upstroke of the action potential is designated phase 0. The upstroke is followed by a brief period of partial, early repolarization (phase 1) and then by a plateau (phase 2) that persists for approximately 0.1 to 0.2 second. The membrane then repolarizes (phase 3) until the resting state of polarization (phase 4) is again attained. Final repolarization (phase 3) develops more slowly than depolarization (phase 0). The other type of action potential, the slow response, occurs in the sinoatrial (SA) node, which is the natural pacemaker region of the heart, and in the atrioventricular (AV) node, which is the specialized tissue that conducts the cardiac
Document 4 (Title: Chromatography -- Introduction -- Stationary Phase): The stationary phase is a crucial component of chromatography that interacts with analytes as they pass through, leading to separation. Solid, liquid, or gas can be held over a supporting medium. The stationary phase interacts with various mixture components based on the polarity, affinity, size, and charge. Thus, different analytes have varying degrees of interaction with the stationary phase, leading to differential retention times and elution profiles. [1] Different types of chromatography use combinations of stationary and mobile phases to achieve separation. Refer to image 1 for the classification of chromatography.
Document 5 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): Phase I reactions usually convert the parent drug to a more polar metabolite by introducing or unmasking a functional group (–OH, –NH2, –SH). Often these metabolites are inactive, although in some instances activity is only modified or even enhanced. If phase I metabolites are sufficiently polar, they may be readily excreted. However, many phase I products are not eliminated rapidly and undergo a subsequent reaction in which an endogenous substrate such as glucuronic acid, sulfuric acid, acetic acid, or an amino acid combines with the newly incorporated functional group to form a highly polar conjugate. Such conjugation or synthetic reactions are the hallmarks of phase II metabolism. A great variety of drugs undergo these sequential biotransformation reactions, although in some instances, the parent drug may already possess a functional group that may form a conjugate directly. For example, the hydrazide moiety of isoniazid is known to form an
