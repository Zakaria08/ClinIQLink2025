Document 1 (Title: Smooth pursuit): Smooth-pursuit deficits Smooth pursuit requires the coordination of many brain regions that are far away from each other. This makes it particularly susceptible to impairment from a variety of disorders and conditions. Schizophrenia There is significant evidence that smooth pursuit is deficient in people with schizophrenia and their relatives. People with schizophrenia tend to have trouble pursuing very fast targets. This impairment is correlated with less activation in areas known to play a role in pursuit, such as the frontal eye field. However, other studies have shown that people with schizophrenia show relatively normal pursuit, compared to controls, when tracking objects that move unexpectedly. The greatest deficits are when the patients track objects of a predictable velocity which begin moving at a predictable time. This study speculates that smooth pursuit deficits in schizophrenia are a function of the patients' inability to store motion vectors.
Document 2 (Title: Psichiatry_DSM-5): White matter connectivity, and gray matter volume in a variety of regions such as the pre- frontal and temporal cortices. Reduced overall brain volume has been observed, as well as increased brain volume reduction with age. Brain volume reductions with age are more pronounced in individuals with schizophrenia than in healthy individuals. Finally, indi- viduals with schizophrenia appear to differ from individuals without the disorder in eye- tracking and electrophysiological indices. Neurological soft signs common in individuals with schizophrenia include impairments in motor coordination, sensory integration, and motor sequencing of complex movements; left-right confusion; and disinhibition of associated movements. In addition, minor phys- ical anomalies of the face and limbs may occur.
Document 3 (Title: Sensory and Perceptual Alterations -- Etiology -- Psychiatric Conditions): Schizophrenia: Altered sensory processing and perceptual inference are responsible for the positive symptoms of schizophrenia. [6] [7] Aberrant neurotransmitter signaling in the sensory pathway and abnormal cortical plasticity mechanisms are implicated in the pathology of schizophrenia. [8] One of the core features of both schizophrenia and ASD are dysfunctional face emotion recognition and motion processing. [9]
Document 4 (Title: Neuropsychological and eye movement abnormalities in first-episode and chronic schizophrenia.): It is well known that neurobehavioral deficits are associated with schizophrenia. Little is known, however, about whether these disturbances becomes more severe over the course of the illness. In the present study, 101 patients with schizophrenia, of whom 45 were first-episode cases, performed pursuit eye tracking tasks. A subset of 60 of these patients, including 27 first-episode cases, were administered a battery of neuropsychological tests. Patients with a history of prior psychotic episodes demonstrated more severe pursuit eye movement dysfunction than first-episode patients and more severe disturbances on neuropsychological tests sensitive to prefrontal and left temporal cortical dysfunction. Longitudinal studies of patients ascertained close to the point of illness onset are needed to determine whether these findings reflect a progressive deterioration in neurobehavioral functioning over the course of schizophrenia.
Document 5 (Title: VNG/ENG Testing -- Procedures -- Optokinetic Test): The optokinetic test is a nonvestibular eye movement test similar to the tracking test. However, during optokinetic testing, the patient follows a visual target with their eyes while simultaneously sustaining low-frequency head movements. Many disease processes that cause tracking abnormalities also lead to deficits in optokinetic testing because smooth tracking pathways contribute to generating optokinetic responses. [5] [8] [4]
