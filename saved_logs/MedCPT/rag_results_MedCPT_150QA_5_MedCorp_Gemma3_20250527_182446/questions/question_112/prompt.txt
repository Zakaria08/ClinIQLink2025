Document 1 (Title: Folate analog nonsubstrates and inhibitors of folylpolyglutamate synthetase as potential cancer chemotherapy drugs.): Folate monoglutamates and classical antifols such as methotrexate (MTX) are converted intracellularly to poly-gamma-glutamyl forms by folylpolyglutamate synthetase (FPGS). Folylpolyglutamates are absolutely essential for cell survival and proliferation. MTX polyglutamates are strongly implicated in the cytotoxic mechanism of this drug. Two new types of antifol could be targeted toward polyglutamate synthesis. One type would be structurally analogous to a folate monoglutamate or MTX, except it would not form polyglutamates. In the case of a folate, this analog might induce cellular deficiency by displacing natural folates. In the case of MTX, the analog might have a therapeutic advantage if MTX polyglutamates are involved primarily in host toxicity. The second approach is through direct inhibitors of FPGS. Two relevant MTX analogs have been synthesized and tested: 4-amino-10-methylpteroyl-4-fluoroglutamate does not form polyglutamates or does so extremely poorly; the second, 4-amino-10-methylpteroyl-2,5-diaminopentanoate, is an inhibitor of mammalian FPGS, as predicted from the work of Shane and co-workers with reduced pteroyl-2,5-diaminopentanoate.
Document 2 (Title: Methotrexate): Mechanism of action Methotrexate is an antimetabolite of the antifolate type. It is thought to affect cancer and rheumatoid arthritis by two different pathways. For cancer, methotrexate competitively inhibits dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), an enzyme that participates in the tetrahydrofolate synthesis. The affinity of methotrexate for DHFR is about 1000-fold that of folate. DHFR catalyses the conversion of dihydrofolate to the active tetrahydrofolate. Folic acid is needed for the de novo synthesis of the nucleoside thymidine, required for DNA synthesis. Also, folate is essential for purine and pyrimidine base biosynthesis, so synthesis will be inhibited. Methotrexate, therefore, inhibits the synthesis of DNA, RNA, thymidylates, and proteins.
Document 3 (Title: Biochemistry_Lippinco): 28.2, p. 378), an enzyme that is inhibited by folate analogs such as methotrexate. By decreasing the supply of THF, these drugs not only inhibit purine synthesis (see Fig. 22.7), but, by preventing methylation of dUMP to dTMP, they also decrease the availability of this essential component of DNA. DNA synthesis is inhibited and cell growth slowed. Thus, these drugs are used to treat cancer. [Note: Acyclovir (a purine analog) and AZT (3′-azido-3′-deoxythymidine, a pyrimidine analog) are used to treat infections of herpes simplex virus and human immunodeficiency virus, respectively. Each inhibits the viral DNA polymerase.] F. Pyrimidine salvage and degradation
Document 4 (Title: Cancer Chemotherapy -- Function -- Antimetabolites): MOA: reduces folate, which is essential in the synthesis of purine nucleotides and thymidylate Indications: Methotrexate for ALL, NHL, CNS, sarcoma, and pemetrexed for malignant pleural mesothelioma, NSCLC (non-squamous) Toxicity: Myelosuppression, mucositis, hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, cutaneous reactions Toxicity prevention: Hydration and alkalization of the urine, leucovorin rescue C) Purine analogs – cladribine, clofarabine, nelarabine MOA: structural analogs of guanine and act as false metabolites Indications: Cladribine for hairy cell leukemia, AML, CLL, NHL. Clofarabine for ALL, AML. Fludarabine for CLL, AML, NHL, and BMT conditioning agents. Nelarabine for T-ALL, lymphoma. Pentostatin is used for hairy cell leukemia, CTCL, and CLL. Toxicities: Myelosuppression immunosuppression (suppress CD4+ cells) puts patients at risk for opportunistic infections D) Pyrimidine analogs – fluorouracil (5-FU), capecitabine (prodrug of 5-FU).
Document 5 (Title: Pemetrexed -- Indications): Pemetrexed is an antifolate metabolic inhibitor approved by the U.S. Food Drug Administration (FDA) in 2004 for the treatment of malignant pleural mesothelioma. [1] [2] Pemetrexed was developed by Edward C. Taylor and his team at Princeton University, who first synthesized lometrexol, the prototypical de novo purine antimetabolite. [3] However, lometrexol's structure was unstable, requiring the C-6 chiral center to be replaced with a pyrrolopyrimidine ring, creating a new molecule: N-[4-[2-(2-amino-4,7-dihydro-4-oxo-1H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-5-yl)ethyl]benzoyl]-L-glutamic acid. Eli Lilly and Company brought this medication to the market and gave it a brand name. [4] Pemetrexed is an antineoplastic agent that can be given as a single agent or as part of combination therapy.
