Document 1 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Factors Related to Practice Style To ensure that necessary care is provided at a high level of quality, physicians fulfill a key role in medical care by serving as the patient’s agent. Factors that influence performance in this role include the physician’s knowledge, training, and experience. Clearly, physicians cannot practice EBM (described later in the chapter) if they are unfamiliar with the evidence. As would be expected, specialists generally know the evidence in their field better than do generalists. Beyond published evidence and practice guidelines, a major set of influences on physician practice can be subsumed under the general concept of “practice style.” The practice style serves to define norms of clinical behavior. Beliefs about effectiveness of different therapies and preferred patterns of diagnostic test use are examples of different facets of a practice style. The physician beliefs that drive these different practice styles may be based on personal experience,
Document 2 (Title: Health Information Technology -- Clinical Significance): Health Information Technology plays a role in improving health outcomes, quality of care, and the health care experience of patients, for example: Allows access up-to-date evidence-based clinical guidelines and resources Improves quality of care and patient safety Assists patients in health maintenance Coordinates care with multiple providers Assists in sharing of clinical information Relieves providers of paper-based referral process that burden practices and organizations.
Document 3 (Title: Changing patient management: what influences the practicing pediatrician?): To explore some determinants of physicians' decisions to change practice habits, we posed three questions: To what extent are some particular innovations diffused among office-based primary care physicians? What characterizes the physicians who have adopted these innovations? And, what caused them to change their behavior and adopt the innovations? Three "markers," recent innovation in medical practice, were chosen using an expert consensus technique. A telephone survey of 200 office-based pediatricians was conducted, and the physicians were asked whether or not they used the following three innovations in medical practice: continuous rather than intermittent phenobarbital for the prevention of febrile seizures, glycosylated hemoglobin measurement in the management of diabetes, and slow release theophylline in the management of asthma. The questionnaire was completed by 156 pediatricians. Of the 110 pediatricians who cared for diabetics, 73% used glycosylated hemoglobin measurement; of the 145 who saw patients with febrile seizures, 77% prescribed the continuous use of phenobarbital (if they used it at all); and, of the 152 pediatricians who cared for asthmatics, 86% reported using slow-release theophylline. The characteristics significantly associated with using the innovations were board certification, group rather than solo practice, teaching, medically related publications, academic appointment, younger age, and caring for a greater number of patients per week. For two of the innovations, discussion with a colleague was the most important source of information leading to a change of practice. The subjects cited local specialists as the colleagues who most often sparked the adoption of an innovation.
Document 4 (Title: Health informatics): Almost all general practices in England and Wales are computerized under the GP Systems of Choice programme, and patients have relatively extensive computerized primary care clinical records. System choice is the responsibility of individual general practices and while there is no single, standardized GP system, it sets relatively rigid minimum standards of performance and functionality for vendors to adhere to. Interoperation between primary and secondary care systems is rather primitive. It is hoped that a focus on interworking (for interfacing and integration) standards will stimulate synergy between primary and secondary care in sharing necessary information to support the care of individuals. Notable successes to date are in the electronic requesting and viewing of test results, and in some areas, GPs have access to digital x-ray images from secondary care systems.
Document 5 (Title: Diffusion of innovations): In threshold models, the uptake of technologies is determined by the balance of two factors: the (perceived) usefulness (sometimes called utility) of the innovation to the individual as well as barriers to adoption, such as cost. The multiple parameters that influence decisions to adopt, both individual and socially motivated, can be represented by such models as a series of nodes and connections that represent real relationships. Borrowing from social network analysis, each node is an innovator, an adopter, or a potential adopter. Potential adopters have a threshold, which is a fraction of his neighbors who adopt the innovation that must be reached before he will adopt. Over time, each potential adopter views his neighbors and decides whether he should adopt based on the technologies they are using. When the effect of each individual node is analyzed along with its influence over the entire network, the expected level of adoption was seen to depend on the number of initial adopters
