Document 1 (Title: Recognition of cluster of differentiation 1 antigens by human CD4-CD8-cytolytic T lymphocytes.): Human cluster-of-differentiation 1 (CD1) is a family of cell surface glycoproteins of unknown function expressed on immature thymocytes, epidermal Langerhans cells and a subset of B lymphocytes. Three homologous proteins, CD1a, b and c, have been defined serologically, and the CD1 gene locus on human chromosome 1 contains five potential CD1 genes. Analysis of the predicted amino-acid sequences of CD1 molecules reveals a low but significant level of homology to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and class II molecules, and, like MHC class I molecules, CD1 molecules are associated non-covalently with beta 2-microglobulin. These structural similarities to known antigen-presenting molecules, together with the expression of CD1 on cells capable of antigen presentation, suggest a role for CD1 molecules in antigen recognition by T cells. Here we demonstrate the specific recognition of CD1a by a CD4-CD8- alpha beta T-cell receptor (TCR) expressing cytolytic T lymphocyte (CTL) line and the specific recognition of CD1c by a CD4-CD8- gamma delta TCR CTL line. The interaction of CD1-specific CTLs with CD1+ target cells appeared to involve the CD3-TCR complex, and did not show evidence of MHC restriction. These results suggest that for a subset of T cells, CD1 molecules serve a function analogous to that of MHC class I and II molecules.
Document 2 (Title: Gynecology_Novak): Antigen specificity is generally regulated by two sets of genes in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), located on chromosome 6 in humans. MHC class I molecules (HLA-A, -B, and -C) are present on the surface of nearly every cell in the human body and are important in defense against intracellular pathogens, such as viral infection and oncogenic transformation. MHC class I molecules act as important ligands for both the T-cell receptor on CD8+ cytotoxic/suppressor T cells and for a variety of receptors on NK cells (122). MHC class II molecules (HLA-DR, HLA-DP, and HLA-DQ), in contrast, are present on the surface of a limited number of antigen-presenting cells, including dendritic cells, macrophage and monocytes, B cells, and tissue-specific cells such as the Langerhans cells in the skin. These molecules are important in defense against extracellular pathogens, such as bacterial invaders. The major ligand for MHC class II is the T-cell receptor on CD4+ T-helper cells.
Document 3 (Title: Genetics, Human Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) -- Biochemical): Class I and Class II molecules differ structurally. HLA Class I molecules are comprised of a polymorphic alpha chain, which is encoded by the Class I genes, and the B2 microglobulin chain, which is encoded by a gene on chromosome 15. The alpha chain is also known as the heavy chain and also has three domains: alpha 1, 2 and 3. The alpha1 and alpha2 domains contain the majority of polymorphic regions conferring HLA antigen specificity. HLA Class II molecules have one alpha chain and a beta chain. [3] [9] Class II region contains DR, DQ, and DP. Each class II molecule has two genes, A and B encoding the alpha and beta chains. [9] [10]
Document 4 (Title: HLA-DMB): HLA class II histocompatibility antigen, DM beta chain is a protein that in humans is encoded by the HLA-DMB gene. Function HLA-DMB belongs to the HLA class II beta chain paralogues. This class II molecule is a heterodimer consisting of an alpha (DMA) and a beta (DMB) chain, both anchored in the membrane. It is located in intracellular vesicles. DM plays a central role in the peptide loading of MHC class II molecules by helping to release the CLIP (class II-associated invariant chain peptide) molecule from the peptide binding site. Class II molecules are expressed in antigen presenting cells (APC: B lymphocytes, dendritic cells, macrophages). The beta chain is approximately 26-28 kDa and its gene contains 6 exons. Exon one encodes the leader peptide, exons 2 and 3 encode the two extracellular domains, exon 4 encodes the transmembrane domain and exon 5 encodes the cytoplasmic tail. Clinical significance
Document 5 (Title: HLA-DRA): Function The polypeptide subunit encoded by this gene belongs to the HLA class II alpha chain paralogues. The class II protein is a heterodimer consisting of an alpha (DRα) and a beta chain (DRβ), both anchored in the membrane. It plays a central role in the immune system by presenting peptides derived from extracellular proteins. Class II molecules are expressed in antigen presenting cells (APC: B lymphocytes, dendritic cells, macrophages). Gene structure and polymorphisms The alpha chain is approximately 33-35 kDa and its gene contains 5 exons. Exon 1 encodes the leader peptide, exons 2 and 3 encode the two extracellular domains, and exon 4 encodes the transmembrane domain and the cytoplasmic tail. DRA does not have polymorphisms in the peptide binding part and acts as the sole alpha chain for DRB1, DRB3, DRB4 and DRB5. Alleles There are two different HLA-DRA chains in the human population coded by three different DRA alleles: See also HLA-DR References Further reading
