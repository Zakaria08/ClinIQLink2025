Document 2 (Title: Community-acquired pneumonia): Hospitalization Some CAP patients require intensive care, with clinical prediction rules such as the pneumonia severity index and CURB-65 guiding the decision whether or not to hospitalize. Factors increasing the need for hospitalization include: Age greater than 65 Underlying chronic illnesses Respiratory rate greater than 30 per minute Systolic blood pressure less than 90 mmHg Heart rate greater than 125 per minute Temperature below 35 or over 40 °C Confusion Evidence of infection outside the lung Laboratory results indicating hospitalization include: Arterial oxygen tension less than 60 mm Hg Carbon dioxide over 50 mmHg or pH under 7.35 while breathing room air Hematocrit under 30 percent Creatinine over 1.2 mg/dl or blood urea nitrogen over 20 mg/dl White-blood-cell count under 4 × 10^9/L or over 30 × 10^9/L Neutrophil count under 1 x 10^9/L
Document 3 (Title: [Neonatal chylous ascites: report of two cases].): Chylous ascites in neonates is an unusual and etiologically poor understood entity. Our first case was a female newborn who suffered from abdominal distension and recurrent vomiting after birth. The history, physical, laboratory, and radiologic evaluations were not diagnostic except the evidence of obvious ascites. Paracentesis was performed and ascitic fluid was obtained. She was later discharged on a strict low-fat medium-chain triglycerides formula. She was found to have continue increase in abdominal girth, poor growth and development, and respiratory distress in which led her to readmission at 8 months of age. Exploratory laparotomy was done in order to rule out an anatomical lesion in which may be obstructing the lymphatic flow; but no such lesion could be found. She expired at 1 year of age with chylothorax, chylopericardium and lobar pneumonia. The second case, a 37-day-old male baby, who was admitted because of right inguinal hernia. Milky ascitic fluid in the abdomen was incidentally found during herniorrhaphy. Analysis of the fluid revealed protein 1,616 mg/dl, glucose 487 mg/dl, and triglyceride 796 mg/dl. Culture of peritoneal fluid grew no bacteria. Other laboratory findings were: serum protein 4.8 mg/dl, and BUN 14 mg/dl. A plain film of abdomen and sonogram showed massive ascites. The infant was then put on Pregestimil with the hope that the medium-chain triglyceride formula would improve his condition. Since then the child's abdominal girth did not increase and he continued to growth and develop normally at 4 months follow up.
Document 4 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): Philip J. Rosenthal, MD A 5-year-old American girl presents with a 1-week history of intermittent chills, fever, and sweats. She had returned home 2 weeks earlier after leaving the USA for the first time to spend 3 weeks with her grandparents in Nigeria. She received all standard childhood immunizations, but no additional treat-ment before travel, since her parents have returned to their native Nigeria frequently without medical consequences. Three days ago, the child was seen in an outpatient clinic and diagnosed with a viral syndrome. Examination reveals a lethargic child, with a temperature of 39.8°C (103.6°F) and splenomegaly. She has no skin rash or lymphadenopathy. Ini-tial laboratory studies are remarkable for hematocrit 29.8%, platelets 45,000/mm3, creatinine 2.5 mg/dL (220 μmol/L), and mildly elevated bilirubin and transaminases. A blood smear shows ring forms of Plasmodium falciparum at 1.5% parasit-emia. What treatment should be started?
Document 5 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): The classic CSF abnormalities in tuberculous meningitis are as follows: (1) elevated opening pressure, (2) lymphocytic pleocytosis (10–500 cells/μL), (3) elevated protein concentration in the range of 1–5 g/L, and (4) decreased glucose concentration in the range of 1.1–2.2 mmol/L (20–40 mg/dL). The combination of unrelenting headache, stiff neck, fatigue, night sweats, and fever with a CSF lymphocytic pleocytosis and a mildly decreased glucose concentration is highly suspicious for tuberculous meningitis. The last tube of fluid collected at LP is the best tube to send for a smear for acid-fast bacilli (AFB). If there is a pellicle in the CSF or a cobweb-like clot on the surface of the fluid, AFB can best be demonstrated in a smear of the clot or pellicle. Positive smears are typically reported in only 10–40% of cases of tuberculous meningitis in adults. Cultures of CSF take 4–8 weeks to identify the organism and are positive in ~50% of adults. Culture remains the gold standard to make

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
Question: A 4-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department by his parents. He is lethargic and confused and has a severe headache, vomiting, and a high-grade fever since earlier that day. His mother reports that the child was doing well until 2 days ago when he developed a fever and green nasal discharge. The patient has a history of neonatal sepsis, meningococcemia at 18 months of age, and pneumococcal pneumonia at 2 and 3 years of age. His scheduled vaccinations are up to date. His blood pressure is 70/50 mm Hg, heart rate is 120/min, respiratory rate is 22/min, and temperature is 39.3°C (102.4°F). On examination, the child is lethargic and his skin is pale, with several petechiae over his buttocks. There is a purulent nasal discharge from both nostrils. The lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Heart sounds are normal. There is marked neck rigidity. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows the following results: Opening pressure 100 mm H2O Appearance cloudy Protein 500 mg/dL (5 g/L) White blood cells 2500/μL (polymorphonuclear predominance) Protein 450 mg/dL (4.5 g/L) Glucose 31 mg/dL (1.7 mmol/L) Culture positive for N. meningitidis Which of the following immunological processes is most likely to be impaired in this child?
Options:
A. Production of IL-2 by Th1 cells
B. Activation of TCRs by MHC-II
C. Formation of C5-9 complex
D. Cleavage of C2 component of complement into C2a and C2b
