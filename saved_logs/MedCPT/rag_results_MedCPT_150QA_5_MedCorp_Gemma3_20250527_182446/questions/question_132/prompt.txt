Document 1 (Title: Sexually transmitted viruses.): Human viruses known to be spread by sexual contact include herpes simplex viruses (HSV), papillomaviruses (HPV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus, and cytomegalovirus. Infections with the first three (HSV, HPV, and HIV) have reached epidemic proportions and pose global health concerns. Most of what we know about these human pathogens has been learned only recently, owing to the advent of DNA technologies and advances in culture techniques. In fact, our awareness of one virally transmitted venereal disease, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, dates to the early 1980s. This paper touches on various aspects of the biology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and, where applicable, oncogenicity of these agents, as well as current treatments and vaccine initiatives.
Document 2 (Title: Sexually Transmitted Infections -- Etiology): Male circumcision appears to significantly reduce the likelihood of acquiring several STIs, including human papillomavirus, genital herpes, and especially human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), where the infective risk decreases by 50% to 60%. [3] [4] The 7 most common STIs include 5 curable infections (chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, and trichomonas) and three incurable but treatable conditions (herpes simplex virus, HIV, and human papillomavirus (HPV). Of note, hepatitis B and hepatitis C can also be transmitted sexually but are more commonly spread through other forms of exposure. See each companion StatPearls reference for more detail. The most common and relevant STIs include the following:
Document 3 (Title: Sexual and reproductive health): Support for contraception is based on views such as reproductive rights, women's rights, and the necessity to prevent child abandonment and child poverty. The World Health Organization states that "By preventing unintended pregnancy, family planning /contraception prevents deaths of mothers and children". Sexually transmitted infection A sexually transmitted infection (STI) --previously known as a sexually transmitted disease (STD) or venereal disease (VD)-- is an infection that has a significant likelihood of transmission between humans by means of sexual activity. The CDC analyses the eight most common STIs: chlamydia, gonorrhea, hepatitis B virus (HBV), herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), human papillomavirus (HPV), syphilis, and trichomoniasis.
Document 4 (Title: Neurology_Adams): A number of viruses share the unique tendency to primarily affect the human nervous system. In some conditions, the systemic effects of the viral infection are negligible; it is the neurologic disorder that brings them to medical attention, that is, the viruses are neurotropic. Included in this group are the human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV-1 and HIV-2), the group of human herpes viruses including herpes simplex viruses (HSV-1 and HSV-2), herpes zoster or varicella zoster virus (VZV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), poliovirus, rabies, and several seasonal arthropod-borne viruses (Flaviviruses). Some of these exhibit an affinity for certain types of neurons: for example, poliomyelitis viruses and motor neurons, VZV and peripheral sensory neurons, and rabies virus and brainstem neurons. Yet others attack nonneuronal supporting glial cells; John Cunningham (JC) virus causing progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy is the prime example. For many of the rest, the
Document 5 (Title: Pediatrics_Nelson): Many infections that are not traditionally considered STIs are sexually transmissible, including those caused by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), human T cell leukemia viruses types I and II, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, human herpes virus (HHV-6, HHV-7), hepatitis B virus, molluscum contagiosum virus, and Sarcoptes scabiei. The presence of any STI suggests behavior that increases risk for HIV (see Chapter 125), and HIV counseling and testing should be provided to all adolescents with STIs. Acquisition of gonorrhea, syphilis, HSV-2, and trichomoniasis in prepubertal children beyond the neonatal period indicates sexual contact and signifies the need to investigate for possible sexual abuse (see Chapter 22); diagnosis of STIs in infants can represent abuse or perinatal acquisition. The association of sexual abuse with vulvovaginitis and genital HPV infection, which may result from skin or genital HPV types, is less certain.
