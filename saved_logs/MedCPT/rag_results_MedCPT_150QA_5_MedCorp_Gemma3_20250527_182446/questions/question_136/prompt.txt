Document 1 (Title: Fluorescence spectroscopy): Fluorescence spectroscopy (also known as fluorimetry or spectrofluorometry) is a type of electromagnetic spectroscopy that analyzes fluorescence from a sample. It involves using a beam of light, usually ultraviolet light, that excites the electrons in molecules of certain compounds and causes them to emit light; typically, but not necessarily, visible light. A complementary technique is absorption spectroscopy. In the special case of single molecule fluorescence spectroscopy, intensity fluctuations from the emitted light are measured from either single fluorophores, or pairs of fluorophores. Devices that measure fluorescence are called fluorometers. Theory
Document 2 (Title: Biochemistry, Polymerase Chain Reaction -- Fundamentals -- Real-Time PCR): The sensitivity of fluorophores has been an essential aspect of qPCR development. Two main types of fluorophores are used in qPCR: those that bind specifically to a given target sequence and those that lack specificity in binding. One of the most effective and widely used non-specific markers, SYBR Green, after binding to the minor groove of dsDNA, exhibits a 1000-fold increase in fluorescence compared to being free in solution. However, if even more specificity is desired, a sequence-specific oligonucleotide, or hybridization probe, can be added, which binds to the target gene at some point, following the primer (after the 3' end). These hybridization probes contain a reporter molecule at the 5' end and a quencher molecule at the 3' end. The quencher molecule effectively inhibits the reporter from fluorescing while the probe is intact. However, upon contact with DNA polymerase I, the hybridization probe is cleaved, allowing the dye's fluorescence.
Document 3 (Title: Cell_Biology_Alberts): Techniques are now available for detecting, measuring, and following almost any desired molecule in a living cell. Fluorescent indicator dyes can be introduced to measure the concentrations of specific ions in individual cells or in different parts of a cell. Virtually any protein of interest can be genetically engineered as a fluorescent fusion protein, and then imaged in living cells by fluorescence microscopy. The dynamic behavior and interactions of many molecules can be followed in living cells by variations on the use of fluorescent protein tags, in some cases at the level of single molecules. Various superresolution techniques can circumvent the diffraction limit and resolve molecules separated by distances as small as 20 nm. Looking at CeLLs anD MoLeCULes in the eLeCtron MiCrosCope
Document 4 (Title: The possible role of electron-transfer complexes in the antitumour action of amsacrine analogues.): Amsacrine is a DNA intercalating agent which is active against a number of tumours in mice and is used for the treatment of leukaemia in humans. In its DNA-bound form, amsacrine efficiently quenches the fluorescence of ethidium. Fluorescence lifetime studies demonstrate two populations of DNA-bound ethidium. The first, whose fluorescence lifetime is constant at approx. 3 ns and whose proportion increases with increasing amsacrine binding ratio, may comprise molecules bound in close proximity to amsacrine. The second, whose fluorescence lifetime is longer and variable (10-24 ns) and whose proportion decreases with increasing amsacrine binding ratio, may comprise molecules three or more base-pairs away from ethidium. Studies with a number of derivatives of 9-anilinoacridine containing different anilino substituents suggest that the observed wide variation in quenching capacity is correlated with the magnitude of the substituent dipole moment in a particular direction. Consideration of the geometry of the DNA-binding complex indicates that the negative pole of a dipole established in the anilino ring is directed towards a positively charged site on the ethidium molecule. Quenching of ethidium fluorescence may therefore occur where an electron-transfer complex has formed between ethidium and amsacrine molecules. To ascertain whether electron-transfer complex formation is biologically important in the amsacrine series, ethidium quenching has been quantitated and compared with activity against a transplantable neoplasm in mice, the Lewis lung carcinoma. Compounds which strongly quench ethidium fluorescence are in general highly active antitumour agents. The results are discussed in terms of a model where amsacrine has both a DNA-binding and a protein-binding domain, the latter possibly interacting by formation of an electron-transfer complex. The most likely protein-binding domain is on the enzyme topoisomerase II, the target for its cytotoxic activity.
Document 5 (Title: Fluorescent rotors and their applications to the study of G-F transformation of actin.): New fluorescent rotor molecules having hydrophilic functional groups, which are derivatives of p-(N,N-dialkylamino)benzylidenemalononitrile, were synthesized. Their properties as fluorescent rotors were confirmed by an observation of solvent viscosity-dependent fluorescence. Incorporation of hydrophilic groups into the molecules increased the solubility of fluorescent rotors in aqueous media; the application of the compounds to biochemical systems became feasible as a consequence. To demonstrate this applicability, we attempted to monitor the G-F transformation of rabbit skeletal muscle actin with these newly synthesized compounds. All the compounds carrying a malononitrile moiety showed greater fluorescence in F-actin. Among them, 1-(2-hydroxyethyl)-6-[(2,2-dicyano)vinyl]-2,3,4-trihydroquinoli ne gave the best result by the criteria of the difference in fluorescence quantum yield for G- and F-actin, solubility, and stability of the compound. The method has the major advantage of not requiring covalent modification of actin.
