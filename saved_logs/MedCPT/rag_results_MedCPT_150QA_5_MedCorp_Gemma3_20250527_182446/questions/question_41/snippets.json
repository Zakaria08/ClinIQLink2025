        "content": "History of Present Illness: A 33-year-old\u00a0white female presents after admission to the general medical/surgical hospital ward with a chief complaint of shortness of breath on exertion. She reports that she was seen for similar symptoms previously at her primary care physician\u2019s office six months ago.\u00a0At that time, she was diagnosed with acute bronchitis and treated with bronchodilators, empiric antibiotics, and a short course oral steroid taper. This management did not improve her symptoms, and she has gradually worsened over six months. She reports a 20-pound (9 kg) intentional weight loss over the past year. She denies camping, spelunking, or hunting activities. She denies any sick contacts. A brief review of systems is negative for fever, night sweats, palpitations, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, neural sensation changes, muscular changes, and increased bruising or bleeding. She admits a cough, shortness of breath, and shortness of breath on exertion.",

        "content": "A variety of tests may be performed in people presenting with cough and shortness of breath: A chest X-ray is useful to exclude pneumonia which is more common in those with a fever, fast heart rate, fast respiratory rate, or who are old. A sputum sample showing neutrophil granulocytes (inflammatory white blood cells) and culture showing that has pathogenic microorganisms such as Streptococcus species. A blood test would indicate inflammation (as indicated by a raised white blood cell count and elevated C-reactive protein). Decreased breath sounds, crackles, wheezing, and rhonchi that clears with coughs may be heard in the chest. Dullness to percussion and pleural rub suggest disease extension beyond the bronchi such as seen with pneumonia. Paroxysms of cough followed by inspiratory whoop and vomiting suggests pertussis.",

        "content": "We reported a case of pneumonitis due to Sho-saiko-to. A 71-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital because of pneumonia. She complained of dry cough, pyrexia and severe dyspnea. Fine crepitation was heard on physical examination of the chest and a chest X-ray film revealed diffuse reticulo-nodular shadow in both lung fields. We suspected summer-type hypersensitivity pneumonitis and followed her up, however her condition deteriorated. Under a suspicion of drug-induced pneumonitis, all drugs were stopped and she was given prednisolone. Consequently her complaints, laboratory data and chest X-ray findings markedly improved. Microscopic examination of a transbronchial lung biopsy specimens showed interstitial pneumonitis. The results of a lymphocyte stimulation test were positive for sho-saiko-to. She gave informed consent after receiving an explanation of the challenge test. She was tested with 2.5 g sho-saiko-to twice and developed high fever and dyspnea with hypoxia, while the chest X-ray film also revealed diffuse infiltrative shadows similar that on admission. Based on these findings, we diagnosed this case as pneumonitis due to sho-saiko-to. To our knowledge, there has been no previous case of pulmonary hypersensitivity due to sho-saiko-to reported in the world.",

        "content": "A case of miliary tuberculosis associated with acute respiratory failure during pregnancy was reported. A 39-year-old, 29-week pregnant woman was admitted to our hospital with complaints of nonproductive cough and fever on June 12. On admission, her temperature was 38.2 degrees C; pulse rate was 90/min., and blood pressure was 120/76 mmHg. Physical examination revealed moist rales at right lung basis. Chest X-ray showed small nodular infiltrates in right lower lung field. Laboratory data revealed positive CRP, accelerated ESR and increased level of alpha 2-globulin. The number of T-cells was markedly decreased (14/mm3). The PPD skin test was negative, and the sputum smears for acid-fast bacilli were negative. Suspected of bacterial or viral pneumonia, the patient was treated with antibiotics (CPM, EM and CAZ), which had no effects for her. On June 16, the Chest X-ray showed infiltrates throughout bilateral lung fields, and the patient became increasingly dyspneic. On June 18, the results of arterial blood gas, analysis under room air were: PaO2 26.7 Torr, PaCO2 29.0 Torr, pH 7.505. Because of severe hypoxemia, she was intubated and placed on a volume-cycled respirator. Hydrocortisone (1000 mg, daily) was added to treatment because ARDS was suspected. Since the smears of tracheobronchial secretions showed acid-fast bacilli on June 24, she was diagnosed to have miliary tuberculosis. Then the intensive therapy with antituberculosis drugs (isoniazid 400 mg, rifampicin 450 mg, and streptomycin 1g, daily) was started. The non specific antibiotics were discontinued; hydrocortisone was tapered and stopped. The next week, she became afebrile and hypoxemia steadily improved.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
