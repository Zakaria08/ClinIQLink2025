Document 1 (Title: J. R. Richard): On July 30, Richard went to see a chiropractor who rotated his neck to fix the flow of blood in his upper torso region. Later that day, Richard was participating in warm-ups before the game when he suffered a major stroke and collapsed in the outfield. Before the stroke, he had a headache and a feeling of weakness through his body. Eventually, that progressed into vision problems and paralysis in the left side of his body. A massive blockage in his right carotid artery necessitated emergency surgery that evening. An examination by neurologist William S. Fields showed that Richard was still experiencing weakness in his extremities and on the left side of his face, and he had blurred vision through his left eye. A CAT scan of Richard's brain later showed that Richard had experienced three separate strokes from the different obstructions in his arterial system. Furthermore, the arteries in his right arm were still obstructed. Later examinations showed that Richard was suffering from
Document 2 (Title: Case Study: 32-Year-Old Male Presenting with Right Lower Quadrant Abdominal Pain (Archived) -- Case Presentation): He describes the pain as coming on suddenly and sharp in nature.   Since the onset, his pain started to improve until the morning of his presentation to the emergency department, when it acutely worsened. He says that the pain is much worse with movement.
Document 3 (Title: [The early hemiparesis of stroke in evolution of basilar artery--case report].): In basilar artery thrombosis, hemiparesis without obvious brainstem signs may precede the tetraplegia with coma or a locked-in state. This premonitory hemiparesis was called as "herald hemiparesis" by Fisher (1988). Its early detection is important because immediate anticoagulant therapy may prevent its evolution. We reported two patients with such hemiparesis. The first case was a 71-year-old diabetic and hypertensive man who was admitted because of right hemiparesis, dysarthria and decreased spontaneous speech. Initially, his symptoms looked like those of a left cerebral lesion. CT scans revealed no fresh cerebrovascular lesion. A few hours later, a myoclonic movement appeared in his left lower limb, and right MLF syndrome developed. We thought he had basilar artery thrombosis and we started intravenous administration of heparin. But he developed tetraplegia with locked-in state. The second case was a 76-year-old diabetic and hypertensive man with a confusional state, right hemiparesis, dysarthria and conjugate gaze deviation to left. After admission, he rapidly became comatose and developed respiratory arrest. CT scans revealed low density areas in the brainstem, cerebellum and the occipital lobe. He died ten days later. Early detection of herald hemiparesis is by no means easy. However, severe dysarthria and myoclonic jerks in a patient with hemiparesis should be considered as warning signs to indicate the herald hemiparesis with subsequent severe brainstem infarction.
Document 4 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): A 45-year-old man is brought to the local hospital emer-gency department by ambulance. His wife reports that he had been in his normal state of health until 3 days ago when he developed a fever and a productive cough. Dur-ing the last 24 hours he has complained of a headache and is increasingly confused. His wife reports that his medical history is significant only for hypertension, for which he takes hydrochlorothiazide and lisinopril, and that he is allergic to amoxicillin. She says that he developed a rash many years ago when prescribed amoxicillin for bron-chitis. In the emergency department, the man is febrile (38.7°C [101.7°F]), hypotensive (90/54 mmHg), tachypneic (36/min), and tachycardic (110/min). He has no signs of meningismus but is oriented only to person. A stat chest x-ray shows a left lower lung consolidation consistent with pneumonia. A CT scan is not concerning for lesions or elevated intracranial pressure. The plan is to start empiric antibiotics and perform a
Document 5 (Title: 38-Year-Old Male Presents With Lower Extremity Edema -- Case Presentation): A 38-year-old African American male, who emigrated from Somalia 10 years ago, presented with a 6-month history of lower extremity swelling, 20-pound (9 kg) weight gain over 4 weeks, and new-onset microscopic hematuria. He had no prior history of edema, proteinuria, or hematuria. There was no prior history of any systemic illness or any heart, lung, or kidney disease. He reported no over-the-counter drug use, herbal medication use, or NSAID intake. His review of systems was positive for lethargy, fatigue, and edema at his lower extremities. His family history was negative for any kidney disease. He reported a monogamous relationship with his wife and no current or past alcohol or drug use. His medical history included recently diagnosed hypertension, latent tuberculosis, and anemia. His vital signs included a blood pressure of 160/90 and a heart rate of 78.

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
Question: A 69-year-old man is brought by his son to the emergency department with weakness in his right arm and leg. The man insists that he is fine and blames his son for "creating panic". Four hours ago the patient was having tea with his wife when he suddenly dropped his teacup. He has had difficulty moving his right arm since then and cannot walk because his right leg feels stuck. He has a history of hypertension and dyslipidemia, for which he currently takes lisinopril and atorvastatin, respectively. He is allergic to aspirin and peanuts. A computerized tomography (CT) scan shows evidence of an ischemic stroke. Which medication would most likely prevent such attacks in this patient in the future?
Options:
A. Alteplase
B. Urokinase
C. Celecoxib
D. Clopidogrel
