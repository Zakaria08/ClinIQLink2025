Document 1 (Title: Breast Cancer Screening in the Average-Risk Patient -- Continuing Education Activity): Breast cancer is the most common non-skin cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in women. Early detection through screening can significantly reduce both morbidity and mortality. Screening recommendations distinguish between women at average and high risk for developing breast cancer, as this risk stratification guides the selection of screening methods and timing. Most major guidelines recommend starting routine mammography at age 40 for women at average risk. Although the frequency of screening—either annually or biennially—varies among guidelines, the overall trend is toward increased surveillance due to its potential to save lives.
Document 2 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): A number of trials have suggested that annual or biennial screening with mammography or mammography plus clinical breast examination in normal-risk women older than age 50 years decreases breast cancer mortality. Each trial has been criticized for design flaws. In most trials, breast cancer mortality rate is decreased by 15–30%. Experts disagree on whether average-risk women age 40–49 years should receive regular screening (Table 100-3). The U.K. Age Trial, the only randomized trial of breast cancer screening to specifically evaluate the impact of mammography in women age 40–49 years, found no statistically significant difference in breast cancer mortality for screened women versus controls after about 11 years of follow-up (relative risk 0.83; 95% confidence interval 0.66–1.04); however, <70% of women received screening in the intervention arm, potentially diluting the observed effect. A meta-analysis of eight large randomized trials showed a 15% relative reduction in mortality
Document 3 (Title: Mammography): Pain The mammography procedure can be painful. Reported pain rates range from 6-76%, with 23-95% experiencing pain or discomfort. Experiencing pain is a significant predictor in women not re-attending screening. There are few proven interventions to reduce pain in mammography, but evidence suggests that giving women information about the mammography procedure prior to it taking place may reduce the pain and discomfort experienced. Furthermore, research has found that standardised compression levels can help to reduce patients' pain while still allowing for optimal diagnostic images to be produced.
Document 4 (Title: Older women's participation in breast screening.): The incidence of breast cancer increases with age, but women's participation in breast screening decreases with age. National and regional surveys indicate a number of barriers. Women over age 65 are more likely to say they have never heard of mammograms, that they did not know they needed them, and that their doctors did not recommend them. In a study conducted at Fox Chase Cancer Center, in Philadelphia, participation in an HMO-sponsored breast screening program appeared to reverse the usual age-related decrease in mammography. If mammography utilization is to increase in women over age 65, physicians must offer unambiguous referrals to older women. In addition, health education interventions are needed to improve knowledge and beliefs of older women and their physicians. And, finally, strategies also are needed to enhance access. With the advent of Medicare coverage, payment will be less of a barrier. But other barriers remain.
Document 5 (Title: Risk factors for breast cancer): There is debate as to whether the higher rate of breast cancer associated with obesity is due to a biological difference in the cancer itself, or differences in other factors such as health screen practices. It has been suggested that obesity may be a determinant for breast cancer screening by mammography. Seventeen scientific studies in the United States have found that as obesity increases in women over 40 years of age the rate of mammography reported decreases significantly. When stratified by race (white vs. black) there was a stronger relationship between obesity and lack of mammography screening among white women. Another study also found lower rates of mammography among those who were overweight and obese compared to those women who were of normal body mass index—this effect was only seen in white women. Obese women are more likely to list pain associated with mammograms as a reason for not getting screened; however, leaner women also list this as a reason for avoiding
