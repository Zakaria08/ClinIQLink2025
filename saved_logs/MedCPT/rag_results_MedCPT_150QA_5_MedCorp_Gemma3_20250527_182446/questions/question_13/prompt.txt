Document 1 (Title: Paroxysmal electroencephalographic abnormalities genetically transmitted: one family description.): A 10-year-old girl came to our observation since a general rule-out electroencephalogram (EEG) had showed, in absence of any clinical manifestation, generalized and symmetrical 3 c/s spike-and-wave bursts, whose duration was longer than 3 s. The subject, only daughter born from her mother's first marriage, had no family history of neurological diseases; her physical and neuropsychological examinations were normal. A polysomnographic recording showed, during sleep, the same abnormalities observed during wakefulness. Also on this occasion, there were no related clinical manifestations. Subsequent recordings were performed on her 33-year-old mother and on two siblings, 3 and 2 years old, respectively, born from their mother's second marriage, all normal by physical and neuropsychological examinations, with no referral about clinical seizures. Among them, the 3-year-old sister showed asymptomatic left rolandic spikes, while the 2-year-old boy, whose EEG was firstly normal, displayed, 1 year later, a burst of generalized 3 c/s spike-and-wave paroxysmal activity on a 4-7 c/s background activity. The possible unitary genetic transmission of paroxysmal EEG abnormalities is discussed.
Document 2 (Title: Lisch Nodules -- Evaluation): LNs have been reported in patients with segmental neurofibromatosis, which is due to a somatic mutation of the neurofibromin gene. [19] A case has been reported describing the presence of LN in a 47-year-old male with NF2 where the patient had bilateral sensorineural deafness and progressive ataxia. MRI revealed the appearance of bilateral acoustic neuromas. Multiple LNs were present in his right eye. [5] A single case report described the presence of unilateral LN with cafe-au-lait macules on the same side of the body. [21] LNs are also reported in patients with Watson syndrome characterized by cafe-au-lait macules, pulmonary valvular stenosis, and mental retardation. [9] A case report described a 43-year-old male with NF1 whose one of the sisters had multiple LNs, while her elder daughter had only one LN. Neither of these 2 patients had any signs of cutaneous or systemic neurofibromatosis. Therefore, LNs are the ocular marker of NF1 in otherwise normal family members of patients with NF1. [9] A case report described a 21-year-old healthy White woman diagnosed to have multiple, unilateral LNs in the absence of additional features of NF1. [22] She, however, had a solitary 5 mm hypopigmented macule on her back under Wood's light illumination. [22]
Document 3 (Title: Polycystic ovary syndrome): The genetic component appears to be inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion with high genetic penetrance but variable expressivity in females; this means that each child has a 50% chance of inheriting the predisposing genetic variant(s) from a parent, and, if a daughter receives the variant(s), the daughter will have the disease to some extent. The genetic variant(s) can be inherited from either the father or the mother, and can be passed along to both sons (who may be asymptomatic carriers or may have symptoms such as early baldness and/or excessive hair) and daughters, who will show signs of PCOS. The phenotype appears to manifest itself at least partially via heightened androgen levels secreted by ovarian follicle theca cells from women with the allele. The exact gene affected has not yet been identified. In rare instances, single-gene mutations can give rise to the phenotype of the syndrome. Current understanding of the pathogenesis of the syndrome suggests, however, that it
Document 4 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): Roger J. Porter, MD, & Michael A. Rogawski, MD, PhD was unchanged, and levetiracetam was gradually increased to 1000 mg bid. The patient had no significant adverse effects from this dosage. At age 21, she had a second tonic-clonic seizure while in college; further discussion with her room-mate at that time revealed a history of two recent episodes of 1–2 minutes of altered consciousness with lip smacking (focal impaired awareness seizure, formerly complex partial seizure). A repeat EEG showed occasional right temporal spikes. What is one possible strategy for controlling her present symptoms? A 23-year-old woman presents to the office for consultation regarding her antiseizure medications. Seven years ago, this otherwise healthy young woman had a tonic-clonic seizure at home. She was rushed to the emergency department, at which time she was alert but complained of headache. A consulting neurologist placed her on levetiracetam, 500 mg bid. Four days later, electroencephalography (EEG)
Document 5 (Title: Biochemistry_Lippinco): Choose the ONE best answer. 0.1. A 10-year-old girl is brought by her parents to the dermatologist. She has many freckles on her face, neck, arms, and hands, and the parents report that she is unusually sensitive to sunlight. Two basal cell carcinomas are identified on her face. Based on the clinical picture, which of the following processes is most likely to be defective in this patient? A. Repair of double-strand breaks by error-prone homologous recombination B. Removal of mismatched bases from the 3′-end of Okazaki fragments by a methyl-directed process C. Removal of pyrimidine dimers from DNA by nucleotide excision repair D. Removal of uracil from DNA by base excision repair

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
Question: A 9-month-old female is brought to the emergency department after experiencing a seizure. She was born at home and was normal at birth according to her parents. Since then, they have noticed that she does not appear to be achieving developmental milestones as quickly as her siblings, and often appears lethargic. Physical exam reveals microcephaly, very light pigmentation (as compared to her family), and a "musty" body odor. The varied manifestations of this disease can most likely be attributed to which of the following genetic principles?
Options:
A. Anticipation
B. Multiple gene mutations
C. Pleiotropy
D. Variable expressivity
