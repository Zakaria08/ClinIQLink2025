        "content": "Operative interventions on the kidneys and ureters were performed in 85 patients. In revision of the upper pole of a kidney and its median segment, the authors have used the original technique of retroperitoneoscopy (paranephroscopy) in the 11-th intercostal space. The techniques of decapsulation of a kidney, pyelo-, nephrostomy by means of the retroperitoneoscope, operative approaches to the different parts of the ureter, technique for removal of its stones are presented.",

        "content": "Using a task trainer can allow for the creation of a simple teaching model leading to a standardized teaching approach and, ultimately, a sustainable outcome. For many years, the standard of practice in the medical community has been Halstead's \"See one, Do one, Teach one\" but this has become less acceptable, particularly when invasive procedures and high-risk care are involved. [4] [5] A more efficient model for teaching procedures that combines multiple aspects of adult learning is Peyton's 4 step approach (see Figure 1). [6] In this model, a teacher can demonstrate the procedure on the task trainer to the learner with no commentary as the first step.",

        "content": "A nephrectomy is the surgical removal of a kidney, performed to treat a number of kidney diseases including kidney cancer. It is also done to remove a normal healthy kidney from a living or deceased donor, which is part of a kidney transplant procedure. History The first recorded nephrectomy was performed in 1861 by Erastus Bradley Wolcott in Wisconsin. The patient had been suffering from a large tumor and the operation was initially successful, but the patient died fifteen days later. The first planned nephrectomy was performed by the German surgeon Gustav Simon on August 2, 1869 in Heidelberg. Simon practiced the operation beforehand in animal experiments. He proved that one healthy kidney can be sufficient for urine excretion in humans. Indications",
