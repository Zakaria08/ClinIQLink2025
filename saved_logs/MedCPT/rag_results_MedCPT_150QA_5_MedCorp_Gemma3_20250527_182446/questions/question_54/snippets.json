        "content": "Short-segment aganglionosis is becoming more frequently recognized in view of more sophisticated diagnostic techniques, as well as the greater clinical awareness of the entity. A series of 37 patients who underwent rectal myectomy during a ten-year period was reviewed. Selected patients with short-segment aganglionosis, proved by muscle biopsy, responded well to a single transanal operation that required an overnight hospital stay. The complications were minimal, and the cure or marked improvement has persisted for as long as 11 years. When major surgery of an abdominoperineal pull-through type was required after the myectomy (four patients), no technical difficulties were encountered. Within the limits of its applicability, rectal myectomy has a definite place in the treatment of short-segment Hirschsprung disease.",

        "content": "When a portion of the intestinal tract is forcefully pulled from or expelled from the body through the anus, it is referred to as transanal evisceration. Following the first report of transanal evisceration by Brodie in 1827, more than 70 cases have been reported to date, the majority occurring spontaneously in elderly individuals. Straining, chronic constipation, and rectal ulcerations predispose to spontaneous perforation in elderly individuals. Cases of transanal evisceration of children whilst sitting over uncovered swimming pool drains have been reported; notable cases include Valerie Lakey (1993) and Abigail Taylor (2007). In Taylor's case, the suction dislodged and damaged her liver and pancreas; several meters of her small intestine were forcefully pulled through her anus. In both these cases, the victims were left with short bowel syndrome and required feeding by total parenteral nutrition. After multiple operations, Taylor later died from transplant-related cancer.",

Anorectal malformations describe a spectrum of congenital anomalies that include imperforate anus and persistent cloaca. Anorectal malformations occur in approximately 1 in 5000 live births and affect males and females almost equally. The embryologic basis includes failure of descent of the urorectal septum.
