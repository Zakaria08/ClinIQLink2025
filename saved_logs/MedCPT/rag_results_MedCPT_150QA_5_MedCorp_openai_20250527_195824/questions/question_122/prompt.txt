Document 1 (Title: Relationship between osmolality and osmolarity.): Since the compendia require the osmolarity of certain parenterals to be labeled and since experimentally only the osmolality can be measured, it is necessary to obtain the relationship between these two quantities. This relationship was determined by considering fundamental physical-chemical definitions. The osmolality of a solution was found to be simply related to the osmotic coefficient. The conversion to osmolarity requires the use of the partial molal volume(s) of the solute(s). A single conversion factor is required for a particular solute system; i.e., the conversion factor is independent of the solution concentration.
Document 2 (Title: Physiology_Levy): Equation 1.8 Osmolarity = concentration × number of dissociable particles mOsm/L = mmol/L × number of particles The terms osmolarity and osmolality are frequently confused and incorrectly interchanged. Osmolarity refers to the osmotic pressure generated by the dissolved solute molecules in 1 L of solvent, whereas osmolality is the number of molecules dissolved in 1 kg of solvent. For a dilute solution, the difference between osmolarity and osmolality is cNaCl does not completely dissociate in water. The value for n is 1.88 rather than 2. However, for simplicity, the value of 2 is most often used.
Document 3 (Title: Plasma osmolality): Plasma osmolality measures the body's electrolyte–water balance. There are several methods for arriving at this quantity through measurement or calculation. Osmolality and osmolarity are measures that are technically different, but functionally the same for normal use. Whereas osmolality (with an "l") is defined as the number of osmoles (Osm) of solute per kilogram of solvent (osmol/kg or Osm/kg), osmolarity (with an "r") is defined as the number of osmoles of solute per liter (L) of solution (osmol/L or Osm/L). As such, larger numbers indicate a greater concentration of solutes in the plasma. Measured osmolality (MO) Osmolality can be measured on an analytical instrument called an osmometer. It works on the method of depression of freezing point. Osmolality versus osmolarity
Document 4 (Title: Serum Osmolality -- Introduction): Osmolality is a colligative property of solutions that depends on the number of dissolved particles in the solution. [1] The term osmolality expresses concentrations relative to the mass of the solvent, whereas the term osmolarity expresses concentrations per volume of solution. Osmolality is thermodynamically accurate because solution concentrations expressed on a weight basis are temperature-independent, whereas those based on volume vary with temperature. [2] Although the term osmolarity is used in the medical literature, osmolality is usually measured.
Document 5 (Title: Physiology, Plasma Osmolality and Oncotic Pressure -- Issues of Concern): Osmolarity is the number of osmoles of solute per liter solution, which is different from osmolality, which is the osmoles per kilogram of solution. Osmoles are different from moles in that they consider the dissociation of cations and anions in water. For example:
