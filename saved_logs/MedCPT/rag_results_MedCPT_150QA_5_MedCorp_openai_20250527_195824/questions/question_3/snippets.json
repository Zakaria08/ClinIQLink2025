        "title": "[Child abuse: report of three cases].",
        "content": "Child abuse, a clinical condition in young children who have received serious physical abuse, is a frequent cause of permanent injury or death. The first case is a 7-year-old boy suffering from abdominal distension and pain for 3 days. He was beaten by his mother as a result of inadequately learning his lessons. Sonogram and CT of the abdomen showed massive ascites and a pseudocyst of the pancreatic body about 3 x 3 cm in diameter. The second case is a 4-year-old girl who developed a semicomatose state after her father impulsively struck her with a chair. CT of the brain revealed subdural hematoma over the left fronto-temporal region and midline shift to the right. She expired 5 days later. The third case, a 2-year-old girl, suffered from headache, seizure, vomiting and general malaise. CT of the brain showed severe brain swelling over the right side and midline shift to the left. She expired 1 month later. Psychiatric factors are probably of prime importance in the pathogenesis of the disorder, but our knowledge of these factors is limited. Parents who inflict abuse on children do not necessarily have psychopathic or sociopathic personalities or come from borderline socioeconomic groups, although most published cases fall into one of these categories. It is clearly the responsibility of all physicians serving children to be aware of, to recognize, and to properly manage any child who has been the victim of abuse.",

She was diag-nosed with Crohn\u2019s disease 2 years ago, and it involves her terminal ileum and proximal colon, as confirmed by colonoscopy and small bowel radiography. She was initially treated with mesalamine and budesonide with good response, but over the last 2 months, she has had a relapse of her symptoms. She is experiencing fatigue, cramping, abdominal pains, and nonbloody diarrhea up to 10 times daily, and she has had a 15-lb weight loss. She has no other significant medical or surgical his-tory. Her current medications are mesalamine 2.4 g/d and budesonide 9 mg/d. She appears thin and tired. Abdominal examination reveals tenderness without guarding in the right lower quadrant; no masses are palpable. On perianal examination, there is no tenderness, fissure, or fistula. Her laboratory data are notable for anemia and elevated C-reactive protein. What are the options for immediate",

        "content": "Two endodermal buds give rise to primitive pancreatic tissue during the fifth embryonic week. A small ventral bud projects from the hepatic diverticulum and becomes the pancreatic head and uncinate process. A larger dorsal bud originates from foregut endoderm and becomes the pancreatic neck, body, and tail. In the sixth week, the dorsal bud grows laterally left until it enters the dorsal mesentery where the pancreatic tail is intraperitoneal. Developmental forces in the embryonic gut reposition the ventral bud and allow for union with the dorsal bud by the seventh week in utero. As the hepatic diverticulum and foregut tube grow, the ventral bud and common bile duct are pulled counter-clockwise around the primitive duodenum into a dorsal position. There, the pancreatic buds unite as one organ and integrate with the common bile duct and duodenum. By approximately gestational day 33, the dorsal bud develops a microscopic luminal network that becomes the acinar, ductal system responsible for handling exocrine secretions. Although the dorsal pancreas forms the bulk of the organ, its associated duct becomes the accessory pancreatic duct of Santorini. Conversely, the duct from the smaller ventral pancreas becomes the main pancreatic duct of Wirsung. Both ducts fuse in the seventh intrauterine week. After birth, exocrine juices preferentially flow through the main pancreatic duct because the portion of the accessory duct distal to its union with the main duct becomes stenotic or obliterates in most humans.

It can result from growth of a bifid ventral pancreatic bud around the duodenum, where the parts of the bifid ventral bud fuse with the dorsal bud, forming a pancreatic ring. It can also result if the ventral pancreatic bud fails to fully rotate, so it remains on the right or if the dorsal bud rotates in the wrong direction, such that the duodenum is surrounded by pancreatic tissue. Blockage of the duodenum develops if inflammation (pancreatitis) develops in the annular pancreas.",

Associated Disorders In pancreas divisum the ducts of the pancreas are not fused to form a full pancreas, but instead it remains as a distinct dorsal and ventral duct. Without the proper fusion of both ducts the majority of the pancreas drainage is mainly through the accessory papilla. Three different variations in pancreas divisum have been described: the first is the classic example of pancreas divisum in which the ventral duct is visualized but there is total failure of fusion; the second variation is with the absence of a ventral duct; and the third variation is when there is very basic communication between the two ducts.
