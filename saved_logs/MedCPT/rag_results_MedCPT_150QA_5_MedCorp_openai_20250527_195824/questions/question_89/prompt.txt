Document 1 (Title: Pelvic Exenteration -- Introduction): Pelvic exenteration was initially described in 1948 for the palliative management of recurrent cervical carcinoma. [2] [1] High surgical mortalities and poor survival outcomes in the 1940s and early 1950s limited the enthusiasm for these radical resections during the latter half of the 20th century. Medical advances involving anesthesia, transfusions, imaging, critical care, and surgical techniques have combined to allow pelvic exenteration to be performed with greater safety and improved outcomes. [3] In the 1950s and 1960s, the indications for pelvic exenteration were extended beyond palliative resections of cervical cancer and currently include curative resection of locally advanced cancers involving contiguous structures (eg, rectal, ovarian, vulvar, prostate, and pelvic sarcomas and melanomas). [4] [5] A nonmalignant indication for pelvic exenteration includes radiation necrosis. [3] [6] [7] The primary contraindication for pelvic exenteration is the inability to achieve clear surgical margins free of malignancy (R0) in a well-informed patient. Because of the postoperative morbidity that may accompany the procedure, there is generally an unspoken consensus that exenteration should be offered only with resectable disease and with curative intent. [8]
Document 2 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): therapy, either preor postoperatively, further reduces the likelihood of pelvic recurrences but does not appear to prolong survival. Combining radiation therapy with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-based chemotherapy, preferably prior to surgical resection, lowers local recurrence rates and improves overall survival. Preoperative radiotherapy is indicated for patients with large, potentially unresectable rectal cancers; such lesions may shrink enough to permit subsequent surgical removal. Radiation therapy is not effective as the primary treatment of colon cancer.
Document 3 (Title: Pelvic exenteration): Recovery Pelvic exenteration leaves a person with a permanent colostomy and urinary diversion. A 2015 article reports that pelvic exenteration can provide long-term survival for patients with locally advanced primary rectal carcinoma. The 5-year survival rate of patients undergoing pelvic exenteration following complete resection of disease was 59.3%. Factors shown to influence the survival rate following a pelvic exenteration procedure include age, the presence of metastatic disease, lymph node status, circumferential resection margin, local recurrence of disease, and the need for neoadjuvant therapy. History The procedure was first described by Alexander Brunschwig in 1948. References Surgical oncology Female genital procedures
Document 4 (Title: Extended resection of fixed rectal cancer.): Between 1980 and 1987, we operated on 23 patients (16 men and 7 women) with fixed rectal cancer. Two patients had primary tumours. Twenty-one patients had recurrent disease (anterior resection, 8; abdominoperineal resection, 13). Eighteen patients had prior irradiation (40 Gy to 120 Gy). Resection was possible in 20 patients (16 for cure and 4 for palliation). Operations included extended proctectomy (n = 4), standard pelvic exenteration (n = 4), and sacropelvic exenteration (n = 12). One (5%) patient died postoperatively and five (25%) others had significant postoperative complications. With a follow-up time of 1 to 48+ months (median, 18 months), nine patients are dead of disease (operative death included), four are living with disease, two are dead free of disease, and eight (50% of those undergoing curative resection) are living free of disease. The results suggest that resection of fixed rectal cancer is feasible in many patients and of potential long-term benefit to approximately 50% of those in whom curative resection is possible.
Document 5 (Title: [Pelvic exenteration in advanced and or recurrent rectal cancer].): Operative procedures of pelvic exenteration which were performed on a 54 yrs male patient with irradiated rectal cancer involving the prostatic gland, perineal skin and gluteal muscles were demonstrated by cinema. Perianal fistula formation and hard fibrotic adhesion between the distal rectum and the sacrum were also seen. As a result, combined resection of the perianal skin, gluteal muscles and distal sacral bone (fourth and fifth sacral and coccygeal vertebrae) was carried out. Fifty four total pelvic exenteration were performed at National Cancer Center Hospital from 1962 to 1985. The procedures were performed as a definitive treatment for the primary tumors in 35 cases (31 males and 4 females) which corresponds to 2.7% of operated primary rectal cancer at the same period and for the locally recurrent cancer in 19 cases (13 males and 6 females). By post operative histopathological examination 35 operations, 28 of 35 primary and 7 of 19 recurrent cases, were assessed as potentially curative. Hospital death rate was 13%; i.e. 7 cases (1 of 35 primary and 6 of 19 recurrent cases). Postoperative survival rates of the 54 patients were calculated by Kaplan-Meier's method. There were 17 survivors among 35 curatively operated patients and 5 yr survival rate was 34%. On the other hand, though 6 patients are surviving, there is no long term survivor (more than 35 months) among 21 patients who were treated by palliative resection.
