Document 2 (Title: [Amblyopia: reading speed in comparison with visual acuity for gratings, single Landolt Cs and series Landolt Cs].): In the treatment of amblyopia in preschool children, a means of predicting later reading ability would be helpful. This prediction might be possible using a test for visual acuity where the results correlate with reading ability in adult patients with amblyopia. We measured the following four parameters in 18 experienced readers with strabismic amblyopia: (1) time spent reading ten lines of a standard text in one of three magnifications, (2) visual acuity for gratings, (3) visual acuity for single Landolt Cs, and (4) visual acuity for crowded Landolt Cs (one Landolt C flanked by two full rings on each side each at a distance of 2.6 min of arc). The reading text was presented on paper at a distance of 40 cm; the subject had a choice of three magnifications. The acuity tests were generated by a computer on a VDU at 4.6 m. The relative impairment of the amblyopic eye was defined as the quotient between the performance of the amblyopic and the good eye. In addition, the difference between the times spent reading the ten lines with the amblyopic and with the good eye was calculated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Document 3 (Title: Evaluation of Visual Acuity -- Clinical Significance): Although conversion tables are available to convert Snellen fraction to logMAR, such conversion may falsely measure the visual acuity to be worse compared to directly measuring the visual acuity with logMAR charts, specifically in individuals with low vision. Therefore, caution should be exercised while analyzing converted Snellen values to logMAR. [32] [33] [34] [35] (see Table 2. LogMAR Equivalencies for Snellen Visual Acuity Measurements). The repeatability of visual acuity measurements using the LogMAR chart was noted to be 2 times of the Snellen chart. [28] [36] LogMAR charts and Glasgow acuity cards may be more sensitive to interocular differences in visual acuity compared to Snellen charts or traditional single-letter acuity tests in young children and, hence, may be more sensitive in detecting amblyopia. [37] Thus, there may be a poor or unacceptable agreement between the Snellen chart and the current gold standard LogMAR chart. [28] Few authors recommend that the time may have come to confine Snellen charts to the annals of history. [36] Snellen chart, by the inherent restriction of the stimulus size, has the effect of truncating the upper limit of the scale, producing, in statistical terms, an incomplete distribution, and the irregular progression of letter size along with the design of the chart may not allow parametric statistics to be employed. [28] [38] Therefore, the conversion of Snellen visual acuity to logMAR using a conversion chart and subsequent analysis of the data has been discouraged. [28] Data are better measured using LogMAR charts for a reliable analysis of visual acuity measurements. [36] However, despite these limitations, the Snellen chart is present in many clinics due to its ease of use and the familiarity it offers compared to the LogMAR chart. Some journals prefer the term corrected distance visual acuity over best-corrected visual acuity. Most journals need the authors to report the mean visual acuity and range of visual acuity in Snellen format for better comprehension. LogMAR values should be used to measure mean visual acuity rather than decimal or MAR values. [39]
Document 4 (Title: Visual acuity): The precise distance at which acuity is measured is not important as long as it is sufficiently far away and the size of the optotype on the retina is the same. That size is specified as a visual angle, which is the angle, at the eye, under which the optotype appears. For 6/6 = 1.0 acuity, the size of a letter on the Snellen chart or Landolt C chart is a visual angle of 5 arc minutes (1 arc min = 1/60 of a degree). By the design of a typical optotype (like a Snellen E or a Landolt C), the critical gap that needs to be resolved is 1/5 this value, i.e., 1 arc min. The latter is the value used in the international definition of visual acuity:
Document 5 (Title: [The Teller Acuity Card Test: possibilities and limits of clinical use].): The Teller Acuity Card test was used to examine 49 normal children, 77 with strabismus, 9 with anisometropia and 19 with various organic ocular diseases. The vision of some of these children was also tested with the Landolt C and fixation preference tests. A comparison of the three tests showed that strabismic amblyopia is not reliably detected with the Teller Acuity Cards. On the other hand, this test appears to be a good one for detecting loss of acuity due to ocular diseases.
