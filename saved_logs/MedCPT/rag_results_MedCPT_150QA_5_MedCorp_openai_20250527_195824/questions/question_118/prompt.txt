Document 1 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): TABLE 22–1 Pharmacokinetic properties of some benzodiazepines and newer hypnotics in humans. 1Time to peak blood level. 2Includes half-lives of major metabolites. because the elimination half-life of the parent drug may have little relation to the time course of pharmacologic effects. Benzodiazepines for which the parent drug or active metabolites have long half-lives are more likely to cause cumulative effects with multiple doses. Cumulative and residual effects such as excessive drowsiness appear to be less of a problem with such drugs as estazolam, oxazepam, and lorazepam, which have relatively short half-lives and are metabolized directly to inactive glucuronides. Some pharmacokinetic properties of selected benzodiazepines and newer hypnotics are listed in Table 22–1. The metabolism of several commonly used benzodiazepines including diazepam, midazolam, and triazolam is affected by inhibitors and inducers of hepatic P450 isozymes (see Chapter 4).
Document 2 (Title: Imidazenil): Imidazenil is an experimental anxiolytic drug which is derived from the benzodiazepine family, and is most closely related to other imidazobenzodiazepines such as midazolam, flumazenil, and bretazenil. Imidazenil is a highly potent benzodiazepine receptor partial agonist with an unusual profile of effects, producing some of the effects associated with normal benzodiazepines such as anticonvulsant and anxiolytic effects, yet without any notable sedative or amnestic effects. In fact, imidazenil blocks the sedative effects of diazepam, yet without lowering the convulsion threshold, and so potentially could be a more flexible antidote than the antagonist flumazenil which is commonly used to treat benzodiazepine overdose at present.
Document 3 (Title: Diazepam -- Indications): Diazepam is an anxiolytic benzodiazepine, first patented and marketed in the United States in 1963. It is a fast-acting, long-lasting benzodiazepine commonly used to treat anxiety disorders and alcohol detoxification, acute recurrent seizures, severe muscle spasms, and spasticity associated with neurologic disorders. In acute alcohol withdrawal, diazepam is useful for symptomatic relief of agitation, tremor, alcoholic hallucinosis, and acute delirium tremens. [1] Benzodiazepines have largely replaced barbiturates in treating anxiety and sleep disorders because of their improved safety profile, fewer side effects, and flumazenil(antagonist) availability that can reverse oversedation in cases of benzodiazepine intoxication.

Document 4 (Title: Differential effects of the 1,4 and 1,5 benzodiazepines on performance in healthy man.): 1 The immediate and residual effects on performance of benzodiazepines differ, and the differences are important in the use of these drugs. 2. Diazepam and its hydroxylated metabolites, temazepam and oxazepam, each possess hypnotic activity, and have effects on performance limited to the sleep period. The demethylated metabolite of diazepam, nordiazepam, and its precursor, potassium clorazepate, which also possess hypnotic activity, have a longer duration of action, although the next day anxiolytic effect is accompanied by only minimal effects on performance. The 1.5 benzodiazepine, clobazam, seems to have minimal immediate effects on performance. 3 Diazepam and its hydroxylated metabolites, temazepam and oxazepam, would be useful in the management of insomnia without psychopathology in those cases in which residual effects on performance must be avoided. Nordiazepam and potassium clorazepate would be appropriate for insomnia secondary to day-time anxiety, and clobazam may be useful as a day-time anxiolytic. 4 It is emphasized that more work needs to be carried out on the effects of anxiolytics on performance before one can be certain that ingestion during the day would be without any deleterious effects on skilled work.
Document 5 (Title: Clinical pharmacokinetics of anxiolytics and hypnotics in the elderly. Therapeutic considerations (Part I).): Anxiolytic and hypnotic drugs are extensively prescribed for elderly individuals throughout Western society. Old age may be associated with an altered clinical response to this class of compounds, and there is a considerable ethical and economic stake in understanding these changes so that therapy may be approached with a maximum likelihood of therapeutic benefit and a minimum risk of side effects. Old age may lead to altered pharmacokinetics of sedative-anxiolytic drugs, causing higher plasma concentrations (relative to young individuals) after single or multiple doses. By far the majority of the available scientific data refer to the benzodiazepines, which have become the most widely prescribed class of sedative-anxiolytic drugs. Although there is not complete consistency in the available data, the weight of evidence indicates that old age is associated with impaired clearance of the benzodiazepines which are biotransformed by microsomal oxidation (such as diazepam, desmethyldiazepam, desalkylflurazepam, bromazepam, alprazolam, triazolam and others). For those benzodiazepines metabolised mainly by glucuronide conjugation (oxazepam, lorazepam, temazepam) or nitroreduction (nitrazepam), there are minimal, if any, age-related decrements in clearance. Only in the case of triazolam is there direct evidence linking impaired clearance to enhanced clinical effects in the elderly. The logical suggestion that benzodiazepines biotransformed by conjugation or by nitroreduction may be safer for the elderly than those biotransformed by oxidation has not yet been directly validated. Reasonable epidemiological evidence has linked the use of long (versus short) half-life benzodiazepines (regardless of the specific metabolic pathway) with an increased incidence of adverse reactions such as confusion, falls and hip fractures in elderly persons. However, the decreased clearance and increased accumulation of the benzodiazepines in question are not clearly validated as the cause of the increased frequency of adverse reactions. Old age may also be associated with an increased intrinsic sensitivity to benzodiazepines; that is, enhanced pharmacodynamic response, relative to young individuals, at any given plasma or target organ concentration. This change in sensitivity may coexist with, or be independent of, alterations in pharmacokinetics. Altered benzodiazepine sensitivity has been documented both in the course of clinical use of benzodiazepines prior to endoscopy or cardioversion, and in placebo-controlled laboratory trials. Animal models of aging have validated an enhanced response to benzodiazepines as a consequence of impaired clearance, increased intrinsic sensitivity or both. However, many studies directly assessing benzodiazepine receptor affinity, density and function in aging animals have failed to identify significant age-related changes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
