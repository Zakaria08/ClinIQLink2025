With your own knowledge and the help of the following document:

Document 1 (Title: Enterobius Vermicularis -- Etiology): Infection most commonly occurs in children, but any individual is susceptible to E. vermicularis infection. People from tropical climates and school-aged children are the most vulnerable. Infection is caused by the ingestion of the pinworm eggs. Transmission is most commonly through the fecal-oral route. [3] Risk factors for pinworms include poor hygiene, eating after touching contaminated items and living with an individual who is identified as egg positive.
Document 2 (Title: Pinworm (parasite)): The pinworm (species Enterobius vermicularis), also known as threadworm (in the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand) or seatworm, is a parasitic worm. It is a nematode (roundworm) and a common intestinal parasite or helminth, especially in humans. The medical condition associated with pinworm infestation is known as pinworm infection (enterobiasis) (a type of helminthiasis) or less precisely as oxyuriasis in reference to the family Oxyuridae.
Document 3 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Diagnosis and Treatment The characteristic 50by 20-μm lemon-shaped Trichuris eggs are readily detected on stool examination. Adult worms, which are 3–5 cm long, are occasionally seen on proctoscopy. Mebendazole (500 mg once) or albendazole (400 mg daily for 3 doses) is safe and moderately effective for treatment, with cure rates of 70–90%. Ivermectin (200 μg/kg daily for 3 doses) is also safe but is not quite as efficacious as the benzimidazoles. E. vermicularis is more common in temperate countries than in the tropics. In the United States, ~40 million persons are infected with pinworms, with a disproportionate number of cases among children.
Document 4 (Title: [A rare finding at gynaecological laparotomy: ovarian pregnancy and pinworm abscess (author's transl)].): A case of concommitant ovarian pregnancy and pinworm abscess is described. The histology and the incidence of Oxyuriasis in the female genital tract are discussed. The clinical symptoms and the management of the condition are also discussed.
Document 5 (Title: [New anthelmintic drugs].): New anti-helminthic drugs have appeared lately: benzimidazoles (mebendazole, flubendazol, and abendazole), praziquantel and ivermectin. Mebendazol and flubendazol are poorly absorbed and are effective for ascaris, oxyuriasis and trycocephalus both in adults and children. Abendazole is well absorbed and may be considered the drug of choice for ascaris and oxyuriasis at a single 400 mg dose. This drug may also be used for hydatid cyst when surgery is not possible and for cysticercosis of the nervous system. Praziquantel is useful for treatment of tenia infections and ivermectin is useful for strongyloides and trichostrongyloides. Detailed dose schedules for different parasitic diseases are given in the text.
