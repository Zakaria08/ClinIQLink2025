With your own knowledge and the help of the following document:

Document 1 (Title: Fascioliasis -- Differential Diagnosis): Acute hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis, and shock liver will all have very significantly elevated transaminases, typically in the thousands. This is much high than the levels seen in fascioliasis which are usually in the hundreds. Toxocariasis, acute schistosomiasis, ascariasis, and strongyloidiasis, are all nearly indistinguishable from fascioliasis in the acute phase, especially in the presence of peripheral eosinophilia and pulmonary symptoms. Serologic testing is required to rule these out.
Document 2 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Parasitic Amebiasis, babesiosis, echinococcosis, fascioliasis, malaria, schistosomiasis, strongyloidiasis, toxocariasis, toxoplasmosis, trichinellosis, trypanosomiasis, visceral leishmaniasis Viral Colorado tick fever, coxsackievirus infection, cytomegalovirus infection, dengue, Epstein-Barr virus infection, hantavirus infection, hepatitis (A, B, C, D, E), herpes simplex, HIV infection, human herpesvirus 6 infection, parvovirus infection, West Nile virus infection Systemic rheumatic and autoimmune Ankylosing spondylitis, antiphospholipid syndrome, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, autoimmune hepatitis, Behçet’s diseases disease, cryoglobulinemia, dermatomyositis, Felty syndrome, gout, mixed connective-tissue disease, polymyositis, pseudogout, reactive arthritis, relapsing polychondritis, rheumatic fever, rheumatoid arthritis, Sjögren’s syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome
Document 3 (Title: Strongyloidiasis): Dissemination can occur many decades after the initial infection and has been associated with high dose corticosteroids, organ transplant, any other instances and causes of immunosuppression, HIV, lepromatous leprosy, tertiary syphilis, aplastic anemia, malnutrition, advanced tuberculosis and radiation poisoning. It is often recommended that patients being started on immunosuppression be screened for chronic strongyloidiasis; however, this is often impractical (screen tests are often unavailable) and in developed countries, the prevalence of chronic strongyloidiasis is very small, so screening is usually not cost-effective, except in endemic areas. The reality of global travel and need for modern advanced healthcare, even in the so-called "developed world", necessitates that in non-endemic areas there is easily accessible testing and screening for neglected tropical diseases such as strongyloidiasis.
Document 4 (Title: [Opportunistic parasitic diseases in Africa. Clinical aspects and diagnosis].): Opportunistic parasitic infections are diagnosed more and more often in African patients with AIDS. Cryptosporidiosis is the most frequent with a prevalence between 7 and 31%. The prevalence of Isospora belli is between 5 and 19% and that of strongyloidiasis between 2 and 5%, depending on the authors. These parasitic infections are probably one of the frequent causes of chronic diarrhea in Africa. The prevalence of toxoplasmosis and pneumocystosis are not well known. (Between 5 and 17% for toxoplasmosis and 29% for pneumocystosis). The diagnostic technics used are those currently known. Toxoplasmosis and pneumocystosis seen in these patients have the same presentations as those in developed countries.
Document 5 (Title: [Fungal and parasitic infections during immunosupressive treatment (author's transl)].): Deep visceral fungus infections, induced by occasional pathogens, have caused a new class of diseases, and occupy a more and more important place among the complications due to immunosuppressive agents. The experience of the Mycology Unit of the Pasteur Institute, where recent techniques of mycological and immunological diagnosis of these fungus infections are used, is reported here. 24 patients submitted to corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive treatments, including 6 renal transplants and one liver transplant, developed deep visceral infection with septicemia due to Candida, in a series of 106 cases of deep candidiasis due to massive antibiotic treatment diagnosed over the last few years. The mycological, immunological and therapeutic data obtained after treatment with amphotericin B and 5-fluorocytosine are reported here. 8 cases of meningeal, pulmonary and bony and cutaneous cryptococcosis, occurring after corticotherapy (6 cases), radiotherapy (1 case) and renal transplantation (one case), are presented together with the favourable results (6 cures out of 8) obtained with amphotericin B and 5-fluorocytosine, eight alone or in association. The authors also report 2 cases of aspergillosis, one in the lung, occurring in a case of renal transplantation who was given, at an early stage, amphotericin B and 5-fluorocytosine, thanks to rapid laboratory diagnosis, and another case in a heart transplant with pulmonary and cerebral localisations from which the patient died. The literature on these fungus infections, together with the mucormycoses, nocardioses and other fungus and antinomycosal complications are reported, together with parasitic infections the severity of which is emphasized in renal transplants, in particular P. carinii pneumonia, toxoplasmosis, strongyloidiasis and other parasitic diseases.
