The dose may be cautiously increased if the desired pharmacological conversion is not achieved after 4 to 5 doses. Oral extended-release formulation: For the first\u00a0treatment\u00a0option, patients are administered 2 tablets of\u00a0324 mg each (equivalent to 403 mg of quinidine base) every 8 hours. If the desired pharmacological conversion is not achieved after 3 or 4 doses, the dose may be increased cautiously. As an alternative regimen, patients may have been prescribed 1 tablet (equivalent to 202 mg of quinidine base) every 8 hours for 2 days, followed by 2 tablets (equivalent to 403 mg of quinidine base) every 12 hours for 2 days, and, finally, 2 tablets (equivalent to 403 mg of quinidine base) every 8 hours for up to 4 days. For the final 4-day treatment plan, the lower dose may be opted at the physician's discretion.",

        "content": "in a sustained-release capsule that dissolves within the small intestine at a pH of 6. Lansoprazole is available in an orally disintegrating tablet that can be taken with or without water, an advantage for individuals who have significant dysphagia. Absorption kinetics are similar to the capsule. In addition, a lansoprazole-naproxen combination preparation that has been made available is targeted at decreasing NSAID-related GI injury (see below). Omeprazole is available as nonenteric-coated granules mixed with sodium bicarbonate in a powder form that can be administered orally or via gastric tube. The sodium bicarbonate has two purposes: to protect the omeprazole from acid degradation and to promote rapid gastric alkalinization and subsequent proton pump activation, which facilitates rapid action of the PPI. Pantoprazole and rabeprazole are available as enteric-coated tablets. Pantoprazole is also available as a parenteral formulation for intravenous use. These agents are lipophilic",

        "content": "Sustained release There are a number of methods by which tablets and capsules can be modified in order to allow for sustained release of the active compound as it moves through the digestive tract. One of the most common methods is to embed the active ingredient in an insoluble porous matrix, such that the dissolving drug must make its way out of the matrix before it can be absorbed. In other sustained release formulations the matrix swells to form a gel through which the drug exits. Another method by which sustained release is achieved is through an osmotic controlled-release oral delivery system, where the active compound is encased in a water-permeable membrane with a laser drilled hole at one end. As water passes through the membrane the drug is pushed out through the hole and into the digestive tract where it can be absorbed. Parenteral formulations",

        "content": "A new drug delivery system with controlled-release effect based on press-coated tablets using poly-D(-)-3-hydroxybutyric acid (Poly-HB) is presented. Model investigations show that the coating of a drug containing core with an indifferent matrix consisting of Poly-HB, a channeling agent (sodium chloride, potassium nitrate or lactose) and the initial dose of the drug leads to a zero-order release kinetics. The system is applicable for oral and parenteral dosage of various drugs.",

        "content": "A series of sustained release tablets were prepared which consisted of a water-soluble core and a highly hydrophobic coat. Release of a macromolecule, Spectrum Orange, from this preparation was studied. It was found that release was controlled by the coat composition and coating solution viscosity. SEM and optical microscopy of the tablets indicated that the coats contained pores on the surface which penetrated in towards the centre of the core. It was deduced that the almost zero order release of macromolecules from these tablets was basically through these pores and not by diffusion through the polymer matrix.",
