        "content": "Chylous ascites in neonates is an unusual and etiologically poor understood entity. Our first case was a female newborn who suffered from abdominal distension and recurrent vomiting after birth. The history, physical, laboratory, and radiologic evaluations were not diagnostic except the evidence of obvious ascites. Paracentesis was performed and ascitic fluid was obtained. She was later discharged on a strict low-fat medium-chain triglycerides formula. She was found to have continue increase in abdominal girth, poor growth and development, and respiratory distress in which led her to readmission at 8 months of age. Exploratory laparotomy was done in order to rule out an anatomical lesion in which may be obstructing the lymphatic flow; but no such lesion could be found. She expired at 1 year of age with chylothorax, chylopericardium and lobar pneumonia. The second case, a 37-day-old male baby, who was admitted because of right inguinal hernia. Milky ascitic fluid in the abdomen was incidentally found during herniorrhaphy. Analysis of the fluid revealed protein 1,616 mg/dl, glucose 487 mg/dl, and triglyceride 796 mg/dl. Culture of peritoneal fluid grew no bacteria. Other laboratory findings were: serum protein 4.8 mg/dl, and BUN 14 mg/dl. A plain film of abdomen and sonogram showed massive ascites. The infant was then put on Pregestimil with the hope that the medium-chain triglyceride formula would improve his condition. Since then the child's abdominal girth did not increase and he continued to growth and develop normally at 4 months follow up.",

Examination reveals a lethargic child, with a temperature of 39.8\u00b0C (103.6\u00b0F) and splenomegaly. She has no skin rash or lymphadenopathy. Ini-tial laboratory studies are remarkable for hematocrit 29.8%, platelets 45,000/mm3, creatinine 2.5 mg/dL (220 \u03bcmol/L), and mildly elevated bilirubin and transaminases. A blood smear shows ring forms of Plasmodium falciparum at 1.5% parasit-emia. What treatment should be started?",

The combination of unrelenting headache, stiff neck, fatigue, night sweats, and fever with a CSF lymphocytic pleocytosis and a mildly decreased glucose concentration is highly suspicious for tuberculous meningitis. The last tube of fluid collected at LP is the best tube to send for a smear for acid-fast bacilli (AFB). If there is a pellicle in the CSF or a cobweb-like clot on the surface of the fluid, AFB can best be demonstrated in a smear of the clot or pellicle. Positive smears are typically reported in only 10\u201340% of cases of tuberculous meningitis in adults. Cultures of CSF take 4\u20138 weeks to identify the organism and are positive in ~50% of adults. Culture remains the gold standard to make",
