        "content": "A child with dihydropteridine reductase (DHPR) deficiency developed signs of dopamine insufficiency after being given trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX). She recovered function after the antibiotic was stopped, which suggests that it adversely influenced dopamine metabolism in the CNS. The authors speculate that TMP, a dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor, was the major cause of the patient's deterioration, and suggest that it and other dihydrofolate inhibitors, notably methotrexate, are contra-indicated for patients with DHPR deficiency.",

        "content": "Additionally, folinic acid is sometimes used to reduce the side effects of methotrexate in rheumatoid arthritis patients. This includes reductions in nausea, abdominal pain, abnormal liver blood tests, and mouth sores. Folinic acid is also used in combination with the chemotherapy agent 5-fluorouracil in treating colon cancer. In this case, folinic acid is not used for \"rescue\" purposes; rather, it enhances the effect of 5-fluorouracil by inhibiting thymidylate synthase. Folinic acid is also sometimes used to prevent toxic effects of high doses of antimicrobial dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors such as trimethoprim and pyrimethamine. It may be prescribed in the treatment of toxoplasmosis retinitis, in combination with the folic acid antagonists pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine. Folinic acid is also used in the treatment of cerebral folate deficiency, a syndrome in which the use of folic acid cannot normalize cerebrospinal fluid levels of 5-MTHF.",
