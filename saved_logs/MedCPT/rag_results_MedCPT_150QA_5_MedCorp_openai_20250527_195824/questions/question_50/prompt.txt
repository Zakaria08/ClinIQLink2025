With your own knowledge and the help of the following document:

Document 1 (Title: Root Cause Analysis and Medical Error Prevention -- Function -- Case example 1): A 42-year-old primigravida woman at 34 weeks gestation was brought to the obstetric emergency department at midnight with complaints of severe headache, blurry vision, and right upper quadrant pain for the last 5 to 6 hours. She noted lower extremity edema and facial swelling that was gradually increasing. She has gestational hypertension and, 1 week ago, was prescribed labetalol 200 mg twice a day. On initial presentation, her blood pressure was 190/110 mm Hg on 2 separate occasions, 5 minutes apart. She had gained 2 kilograms since her last antenatal checkup in the clinic a week ago. The patient was diagnosed with severe preeclampsia. The senior obstetric resident ordered a loading dose of magnesium sulfate to prevent imminent seizure. The hospital protocol used an intravenous (IV) and intramuscular (IM) regimen where the patient received a 4 g IV bolus and a 10 g IM dose administered as 5 g in each buttock. The senior resident gave verbal orders for magnesium sulfate administration to the junior resident, who verbally communicated the order to the nurse.
Document 2 (Title: Biochemistry_Lippinco): Patient Presentation: BE is a 45-year-old woman who presents with concerns about sudden (paroxysmal), intense, brief episodes of headache, sweating (diaphoresis), and a racing heart (palpitations). Focused History: BE reports that the attacks started ~3 weeks ago. They last from 2 to 10 minutes, during which time she feels quite anxious. During the attacks, it feels as though her heart is skipping beats (arrhythmia). At first, she thought the attacks were related to recent stress at work and maybe even menopause. The last time it happened, she was in a pharmacy and had her blood pressure taken. She was told it was 165/110 mm Hg. BE notes that she has lost weight (~8 lbs) in this period even though her appetite has been good.
Document 3 (Title: Advanced abdominal pregnancy: a case report.): A 37-year-old, gravida 5 with 41 weeks of gestation was admitted because of slight vaginal bleeding, abdominal pain, and absence of fetal movements for a few days. Previously she had been admitted to a provincial hospital with sudden severe abdominal pain and fainting at the second month of her pregnancy and ectopic pregnancy was suspected. She was discharged the following morning, after all signs and symptoms had completely disappeared without any special investigation. On her last admission all clinical examinations were normal but fetal heart sound was absent. The cervix was closed and uneffaced. Abdominal X-ray showed signs of fetal death. Sonography confirmed a dead fetus in utero but with placenta previa totalis. A laparotomy was performed. A macerated female fetus, weighting 3,800 g was found in the amniotic sac lying in the abdominal cavity. The placenta was attached to the dorsal surface of her abdomen close to the large intestine and the omentum; the entire placenta was untouched and left in the peritoneal cavity. There were no postoperative complications. She recovered well and was discharged after 7 days.
Document 4 (Title: Uterine atony): Most diagnosis of uterine atony are made during the physical exam directly upon completion of the delivery. Diffuse uterine atony is typically diagnosed by patient observation rather than blood loss. The uterus can be directly palpated or observed indirectly using a bimanual examination post delivery. An atonic uterus can feel soft, "boggy" and/or enlarged. Bleeding from the cervical os is also common. If the atony is localized to one area of the uterus, the upper, fundal region may be still be squeezing while the lower uterine segment is non functional. This can be difficult to see with a cursory abdominal examination and easily overlooked. Therefore, a comprehensive vaginal, abdominal, and rectal examination should be performed. The physical examination may include ultrasound imaging for rapid visualization of the uterus and other causes of bleeding. Expulsion of gestational products such as the placenta and rapid identification of obstetric lacerations, helps exclude other causes
Document 5 (Title: Anatomy_Gray): This patient had no symptoms attributable to the pelvic kidney and she was discharged. A 19-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with a 36-hour history of lower abdominal pain that was sharp and initially intermittent, later becoming constant and severe. The patient also reported feeling nauseated and vomited once in the ER. She did not have diarrhea and had opened her bowels normally 8 hours before admission. She had no symptoms of dysuria. She was afebrile, slightly tachycardic at 95/min, and had a normal blood pressure. Blood results showed mild leukocytosis of 11.6 x 109/L and normal renal and liver function tests. She reported being sexually active with a long-term partner. She was never pregnant, and the urine pregnancy test on admission was negative.

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
Question: A 23-year-old G1 at 10 weeks gestation based on her last menstrual period is brought to the emergency department by her husband due to sudden vaginal bleeding. She says that she has mild lower abdominal cramps and is feeling dizzy and weak. Her blood pressure is 100/60 mm Hg, the pulse is 100/min, and the respiration rate is 15/min. She says that she has had light spotting over the last 3 days, but today the bleeding increased markedly and she also noticed the passage of clots. She says that she has changed three pads since the morning. She has also noticed that the nausea she was experiencing over the past few days has subsided. The physician examines her and notes that the cervical os is open and blood is pooling in the vagina. Products of conception can be visualized in the os. The patient is prepared for a suction curettage. Which of the following is the most likely cause for the pregnancy loss?
Options:
A. Rh immunization
B. Antiphospholipid syndrome
C. Chromosomal abnormalities
D. Trauma
