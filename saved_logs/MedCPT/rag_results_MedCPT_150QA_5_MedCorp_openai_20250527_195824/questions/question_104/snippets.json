        "content": "Listeria commonly causes meningitis in the young (neonates), elderly, and immunocompromised patient population. Healthy individuals infected with L. monocytogenes typically have a self-limiting gastrointestinal infection with fever and diarrhea. The Listeria family consists of 10 different species with L. monocytogenes found most consistently in humans. L. monocytogenes has 13 different serotypes based on a variety of flagellar and surface antigens. \u00a0However, there are only three serotypes (1/2a, 1/2b, 4a) that inflict disease in humans. [3] In general, the infectious dose of L. monocytogenes is large, meaning one must ingest a large number to cause clinical infection, but as growth and division can continue at refrigerator temperatures, these levels can\u00a0be reached despite typical food storage precautions. Host immune response also affects the infectious dose. Utilization of proton pump inhibitors or other stomach acid suppression modalities makes it easier for L. monocytogenes to pass through the stomach and invade enterocytes.",

Portnoy Listeria monocytogenes is a food-borne pathogen that can cause serious infections, particularly in pregnant women and immunocompromised 176 individuals. A ubiquitous saprophytic environmental bacterium, L. monocytogenes is also a facultative intracellular pathogen with a broad host range. Humans are probably accidental hosts for this microorganism. L. monocytogenes is of interest not only to clinicians but also to basic scientists as a model intracellular pathogen that is used to study basic mechanisms of microbial pathogenesis and host immunity. L. monocytogenes is a facultatively anaerobic, nonsporulating, gram-positive rod that grows over a broad temperature range, including refrigeration temperatures. This organism is motile during growth at low temperatures but much less so at 37\u00b0C. The vast majority of cases of human listerial disease can be traced to serotypes 1/2a, 1/2b, and 4.",

        "title": "Listeria monocytogenes, a food-borne pathogen.",
        "content": "The gram-positive bacterium Listeria monocytogenes is an ubiquitous, intracellular pathogen which has been implicated within the past decade as the causative organism in several outbreaks of foodborne disease. Listeriosis, with a mortality rate of about 24%, is found mainly among pregnant women, their fetuses, and immunocompromised persons, with symptoms of abortion, neonatal death, septicemia, and meningitis. Epidemiological investigations can make use of strain-typing procedures such as DNA restriction enzyme analysis or electrophoretic enzyme typing. The organism has a multifactorial virulence system, with the thiol-activated hemolysin, listeriolysin O, being identified as playing a crucial role in the organism's ability to multiply within host phagocytic cells and to spread from cell to cell. The organism occurs widely in food, with the highest incidences being found in meat, poultry, and seafood products. Improved methods for detecting and enumerating the organism in foodstuffs are now available, including those based on the use of monoclonal antibodies, DNA probes, or the polymerase chain reaction. As knowledge of the molecular and applied biology of L. monocytogenes increases, progress can be made in the prevention and control of human infection.",

It can cause cranial nerve palsies, encephalitis, meningitis, meningoencephalitis and abscesses. Mental status changes are common. Seizures occur in at least 25% of patients. Gastroenteritis: L. monocytogenes can produce food-borne diarrheal disease, which typically is noninvasive. The median incubation period is 21 days, with diarrhea lasting anywhere from 1\u20133 days. Affected people present with fever, muscle aches, gastrointestinal nausea or diarrhea, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance, or convulsions.",
