        "title": "Filovirus -- Epidemiology",
        "content": "The first discovery of filovirus was in 1976 and since that time has had over twenty known outbreaks, mainly located in sub-Saharan Africa in isolated rural areas and focused around Sudan, Uganda, Democratic Republic of Congo, and Gabon. To date, the largest known outbreak occurred in West Africa from 2013 to 2016. This outbreak involved multiple countries, both rural and urban areas, and had a high mortality rate with over 28000 infections and 11000 deaths. However, this number may be optimistic as the actual number is thought to be much higher due to under-reporting.\u00a0 Thus far, the ebolavirus outbreaks in humans have been constrained to African countries, but this could change easily with international travel and secondary cases have been reported in Spain and the USA.",

        "content": "The aim of the study was to determine whether the inverse association between high density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration and risk of coronary heart disease described in people of European stock was also present in other racial groups. The study was a prospective population survey. Cardiovascular risk factors were examined, including fasting serum lipid estimation (obtained at recruitment). This was a community based study within a defined survey area in Trinidad. All men aged between 35 and 69 years within the survey area were identified and followed between 1977 and 1986. Analysis was confined to those of African, Asian Indian, and mixed descent who were free of coronary heart disease at entry (n = 960, 69% of age eligible men in the survey population). 64 men developed coronary heart disease during the study period. A strong inverse curvilinear relation was found between high density lipoprotein cholesterol and coronary heart disease incidence (p less than 0.005), independent of age or other relevant characteristics including low density lipoprotein cholesterol. A low serum concentration of high density lipoprotein cholesterol is a risk factor for coronary heart disease in non-whites as well as in whites.",

        "content": "Other studies have shown that a high resting heart rate is associated with an increase in cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in the general population and in patients with chronic diseases. A faster resting heart rate is associated with shorter life expectancy and is considered a strong risk factor for heart disease and heart failure, independent of level of physical fitness. Specifically, a resting heart rate above 65 beats per minute has been shown to have a strong independent effect on premature mortality; every 10 beats per minute increase in resting heart rate has been shown to be associated with a 10\u201320% increase in risk of death. In one study, men with no evidence of heart disease and a resting heart rate of more than 90 beats per minute had a five times higher risk of sudden cardiac death. Similarly, another study found that men with resting heart rates of over 90 beats per minute had an almost two-fold increase in risk for cardiovascular disease mortality; in women it",

        "content": "Epidemiological studies of the cardiovascular characteristics of three typically rural communities in the Gambia, Jamaica, and the United Republic of Tanzania were carried out by means of standardized methodology. This paper reports comparisons of arterial blood pressure distribution and electrocardiographic findings in relation to age, sex, and body build. Marked differences in blood pressure were found, with higher values in Jamaicans than in Tanzanians, who in turn had higher values than Gambians. These differences are not explicable in terms of body build. Heart rates and ECG amplitudes were also strikingly different, with higher values in Jamaicans than in Tanzanians and Gambians. The differences in ECG amplitudes cannot be explained by differences in body build, heart rate, or blood pressure. The findings agree with the hypothesis that some factor or factors associated with development contributes to the risk of cardiovascular disease in peoples of African origin.",
