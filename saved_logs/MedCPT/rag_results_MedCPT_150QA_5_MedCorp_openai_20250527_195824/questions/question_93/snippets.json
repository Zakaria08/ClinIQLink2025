        "content": "The clinical features and management of 12 patients with Fournier's gangrene are described. The patients differed from the usual description of Fournier's gangrene in that they were older, the disease had a less abrupt onset and a definite predisposing factor was identified in 10 of the 12 patients. The importance of early diagnosis and excision of necrotic tissue is emphasized.",

        "content": "Fournier gangrene is a type of necrotizing fasciitis or gangrene affecting the external genitalia or perineum. It commonly occurs in older men, but it can also occur in women and children. It is more likely to occur in diabetics, alcoholics, or those who are immunocompromised. About one per 62,500 males are affected per year. Males are affected about 40 times more often than females. It was first described by Baurienne in 1764 and is named after a French venereologist, Jean Alfred Fournier, following five cases he presented in clinical lectures in 1883.",
