Document 1 (Title: Fournier's gangrene: its aetiology and management.): The clinical features and management of 12 patients with Fournier's gangrene are described. The patients differed from the usual description of Fournier's gangrene in that they were older, the disease had a less abrupt onset and a definite predisposing factor was identified in 10 of the 12 patients. The importance of early diagnosis and excision of necrotic tissue is emphasized.
Document 2 (Title: Fournier gangrene): Fournier gangrene is a type of necrotizing fasciitis or gangrene affecting the external genitalia or perineum. It commonly occurs in older men, but it can also occur in women and children. It is more likely to occur in diabetics, alcoholics, or those who are immunocompromised. About one per 62,500 males are affected per year. Males are affected about 40 times more often than females. It was first described by Baurienne in 1764 and is named after a French venereologist, Jean Alfred Fournier, following five cases he presented in clinical lectures in 1883.

Document 5 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): catheter can be removed after 1 to 2 days. Postvoid residuals should be checked with a portable ultrasound device (bladder scanner) or by “straight” catheterization to determine the residual amount of urine left after the patient tries to empty his or her bladder. In patients with severe liver dysfunction, the bladder scanner may inadvertently misinterpret ascites for urine. The inability to void or the presence of a postvoid residual over 200 mL is concerning for development of another episode of AUR. Patients may be given the option of an indwelling cath-eter for another few days with a subsequent voiding trial or to perform clean intermittent catheterization (CIC), whereby, after Brunicardi_Ch40_p1759-p1782.indd 176801/03/19 6:35 PM 1769UROLOGYCHAPTER 40Figure 40-7.
