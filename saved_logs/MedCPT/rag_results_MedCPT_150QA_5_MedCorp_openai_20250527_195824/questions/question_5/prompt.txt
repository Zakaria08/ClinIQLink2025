Document 1 (Title: [Prophylactic use of DDAVP in a patient with von Willebrand disease during labor: a case report and a review].): A Case of delivery in a 23-year-old woman after a prophylactic infusion of DDAVP is described. She had a life-long history of easy bruising and frequent epistaxis, with the diagnosis of vWD being made when she was 14 years old. A hemostatic examination showed a prolonged bleeding time, a moderate reduction in the factor VIII level (VIII: C) and von Willebrand Factor Antigen (vWF: Ag), decreased platelet aggregation by ristocetin, and depletion of platelet retention. In April, 1988, in the 34th week of pregnancy, she was admitted to our clinic in order to avoid abnormal bleeding during labor. On admission, the level of factor VIII, ristocetin aggregation, and platelet retention were normal, but the bleeding time remained prolonged. The diagnosis of vWD type I was made on the normal multimeric structure. The DDAVP infusion test revealed a shortening of the bleeding time and an increase in the vWF: Ag. In the 41st week of pregnancy, labor was induced, accompanied by infusion of DDAVP, she gave birth to an infant without any abnormal bleeding. Since conventional treatments with human plasma derivatives may cause complicating viral infections, we propose the infusion of DDAVP is one of the treatments to prevent the abnormal bleeding of the patient with vWD during labor.
Document 2 (Title: Von Willebrand disease): Many patients are asymptomatic or may have mild symptoms and not have clearly impaired clotting, which might suggest a bleeding disorder. Often, the discovery of VWD occurs incidentally to other medical procedures requiring a blood work-up. Most cases of type 1 VWD are never diagnosed due to the asymptomatic or mild presentation of type I and most people usually end up leading a normal life free of complications, with many being unaware that they have the disorder. Trouble may, however, arise in some patients in the form of bleeding following surgery (including dental procedures), noticeable easy bruising, or menorrhagia (heavy menstrual periods). The minority of cases of type 1 may present with severe hemorrhagic symptoms. Type 2 Type 2 VWD (15-50% of cases) is a qualitative defect and the bleeding tendency can vary between individuals. Four subtypes exist: 2A, 2B, 2M, and 2N. These subtypes depend on the presence and behavior of the underlying multimers.
Document 3 (Title: Case Study: 33-Year-Old Female Presents with Chronic SOB and Cough (Archived) -- Case Presentation -- Physical Exam:): Vitals: Temperature, 97.8 F; heart rate 88; respiratory rate, 22; blood pressure 130/86; body mass index, 28 General: She is well appearing but anxious, a pleasant female lying on a hospital stretcher. She is conversing freely, with respiratory distress causing her to stop mid-sentence. Respiratory: She has diffuse rales and mild wheezing; tachypneic. Cardiovascular: She has a regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Gastrointestinal: Bowel sounds X4. No bruits or pulsatile mass.
Document 4 (Title: Anatomy_Gray): This patient had no symptoms attributable to the pelvic kidney and she was discharged. A 19-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with a 36-hour history of lower abdominal pain that was sharp and initially intermittent, later becoming constant and severe. The patient also reported feeling nauseated and vomited once in the ER. She did not have diarrhea and had opened her bowels normally 8 hours before admission. She had no symptoms of dysuria. She was afebrile, slightly tachycardic at 95/min, and had a normal blood pressure. Blood results showed mild leukocytosis of 11.6 x 109/L and normal renal and liver function tests. She reported being sexually active with a long-term partner. She was never pregnant, and the urine pregnancy test on admission was negative.
Document 5 (Title: Case Study: 33-Year-Old Female Presents with Chronic SOB and Cough (Archived) -- Case Presentation): History of Present Illness: A 33-year-old white female presents after admission to the general medical/surgical hospital ward with a chief complaint of shortness of breath on exertion. She reports that she was seen for similar symptoms previously at her primary care physician’s office six months ago. At that time, she was diagnosed with acute bronchitis and treated with bronchodilators, empiric antibiotics, and a short course oral steroid taper. This management did not improve her symptoms, and she has gradually worsened over six months. She reports a 20-pound (9 kg) intentional weight loss over the past year. She denies camping, spelunking, or hunting activities. She denies any sick contacts. A brief review of systems is negative for fever, night sweats, palpitations, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, neural sensation changes, muscular changes, and increased bruising or bleeding. She admits a cough, shortness of breath, and shortness of breath on exertion.

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
Question: A 20-year-old woman presents with menorrhagia for the past several years. She says that her menses “have always been heavy”, and she has experienced easy bruising for as long as she can remember. Family history is significant for her mother, who had similar problems with bruising easily. The patient's vital signs include: heart rate 98/min, respiratory rate 14/min, temperature 36.1°C (96.9°F), and blood pressure 110/87 mm Hg. Physical examination is unremarkable. Laboratory tests show the following: platelet count 200,000/mm3, PT 12 seconds, and PTT 43 seconds. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient’s symptoms?
Options:
A. Hemophilia A
B. Lupus anticoagulant
C. Protein C deficiency
D. Von Willebrand disease
