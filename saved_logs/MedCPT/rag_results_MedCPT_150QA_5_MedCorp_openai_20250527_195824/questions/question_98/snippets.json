Generally, children cannot autonomously provide informed consent, but depending on their age and other factors, may be required to provide informed assent. Statistical power In any clinical trial, the number of subjects, also called the sample size, has a large impact on the ability to reliably detect and measure the effects of the intervention. This ability is described as its \"power\", which must be calculated before initiating a study to figure out if the study is worth its costs. In general, a larger sample size increases the statistical power, also the cost.",

        "title": "Increasing participation by private physicians in the EPSDT Program in rural North Carolina.",
        "content": "This study evaluated a method to increase physicians' participation in Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis and Treatment (EPSDT), a preventive health care program for Medicaid eligible children. Use of EPSDT can improve children's health status and reduce health care costs. Although the potential benefits of EPSDT are clear, the program is underused; low rates of participation by private physicians contribute to underuse. This study targeted a population of 73 primary care physicians in six rural counties in North Carolina where the physician supply, their participation in EPSDT, and use of EPSDT were low. A mailed intervention packet attempted to address barriers to participation perceived by private providers. The packet consisted of a carefully constructed letter, an informative journal article, and an educational pamphlet. Participation in EPSDT screening increased from 15 to 25 private physicians (67 percent), at a cost, on average, of less than $30 per recruited provider. Suggestions are presented for adapting the intervention packet to other settings.",

        "content": "An additional aspect of respecting potential participants' self-determination is to ensure that researchers have fully disclosed information about the study and explained the voluntary nature of participation (including the right to refuse without repercussion) and possible benefits and risks related to study participation. A potential participant cannot make a truly informed decision without complete information. This aspect of the Belmont Report can be troublesome for some researchers based on their study designs and research questions. Noted biases related to reactivity may occur when study participants know the exact guiding research questions and purposes. Some researchers may avoid reactivity biases using covert data collection methods or masking critical study information. Masking frequently occurs in pharmaceutical trials with placebos because knowledge of placebo receipt can affect study outcomes. However, masking and concealed data collection methods may not fully respect participants' rights to autonomy and the associated informed consent process. Any researcher considering hidden data collection or masking of some research information from participants must present their plans to an Institutional Review Board (IRB) for oversight, as well as explain the potential masking to prospective patients in the consent process (ie, explaining to potential participants in a medication trial that they are\u00a0randomly assigned either the medication or a placebo). The IRB determines if studies warrant concealed data collection or masking methods in light of the research design, methods, and study-specific protections. [6]",
