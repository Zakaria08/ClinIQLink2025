Document 1 (Title: Biochemistry_Lippinco): Choose the ONE best answer. .1. A 30-year-old woman of Northern European ancestry presents with progressive dyspnea (shortness of breath). She denies the use of cigarettes. Family history reveals that her sister also has problems with her lungs. Which one of the following etiologies most likely explains this patient’s pulmonary symptoms? A. Deficiency in dietary vitamin C B. Deficiency of α1-antitrypsin C. Deficiency of prolyl hydroxylase D. Decreased elastase activity E. Increased collagenase activity
Document 2 (Title: Case Study: 33-Year-Old Female Presents with Chronic SOB and Cough (Archived) -- Case Presentation): History of Present Illness: A 33-year-old white female presents after admission to the general medical/surgical hospital ward with a chief complaint of shortness of breath on exertion. She reports that she was seen for similar symptoms previously at her primary care physician’s office six months ago. At that time, she was diagnosed with acute bronchitis and treated with bronchodilators, empiric antibiotics, and a short course oral steroid taper. This management did not improve her symptoms, and she has gradually worsened over six months. She reports a 20-pound (9 kg) intentional weight loss over the past year. She denies camping, spelunking, or hunting activities. She denies any sick contacts. A brief review of systems is negative for fever, night sweats, palpitations, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, neural sensation changes, muscular changes, and increased bruising or bleeding. She admits a cough, shortness of breath, and shortness of breath on exertion.
Document 3 (Title: Association of pancreas affection and yersiniosis. A case report.): A case history of a 25-year-old female is reported. She had no diseases predisposing for pancreatic disease. A few days after a familial outbreak of yersinia enteritis, she again became ill and was referred to hospital. Clinical and laboratory examination made it likely that she underwent an acute pancreatic affection, and the serological test proved that she had been through an acute yersiniosis. The coincidental occurrence may of course be by change, but considering the immunological aspects of secondary yersiniosis, there might also be an etiological link.
Document 4 (Title: Chronic pancreatitis): Causes Among the causes of chronic pancreatitis are the following: The relationship between etiologic factors, genetic predisposition, and the pace of disease progression requires further clarification, though recent research indicates smoking may be a high-risk factor to develop chronic pancreatitis. In a small group of patients chronic pancreatitis has been shown to be hereditary. Almost all patients with cystic fibrosis have established chronic pancreatitis, usually from birth. Cystic fibrosis gene mutations have also been identified in patients with chronic pancreatitis but in whom there were no other manifestations of cystic fibrosis. Obstruction of the pancreatic duct because of either a benign or malignant process may result in chronic pancreatitis. Pathophysiology
Document 5 (Title: Common variable immunodeficiency): Onset symptoms, including frequent infections, may occur during adolescence, however, for many patients, the symptoms and diagnosis may not occur until adulthood. People with common variable immunodeficiency have trouble fighting off infections due to the lack of antibodies produced which normally resit invading microbes. Due to impaired antibody development vaccines are not effective. Recurring bacterial infections are generally found in the upper and lower areas of the respiratory tract. Many who have a recurring lung infection, report developing, chronic lung diseases, and potentially life-threatening complications later in life. Causes The underlying causes of CVID are largely obscure. Genetic mutations can be identified as the cause of disease in about 10% of people, while familial inheritance accounts for 10-25% of cases. Rather than arising from a single genetic mutation, CVID seems to result from variety of mutations that all contribute to a failure in antibody production.

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
Question: A 27-year-old female presents to general medical clinic for a routine checkup. She has a genetic disease marked by a mutation in a chloride transporter. She has a history of chronic bronchitis. She has a brother with a similar history of infections as well as infertility. Which of the following is most likely true regarding a potential vitamin deficiency complication secondary to this patient's chronic illness?
Options:
A. It may result in corneal vascularization
B. It may result in the triad of confusion, ophthalmoplegia, and ataxia
C. It may be exacerbated by excessive ingestion of raw eggs
D. It may manifest itself as a prolonged PT
