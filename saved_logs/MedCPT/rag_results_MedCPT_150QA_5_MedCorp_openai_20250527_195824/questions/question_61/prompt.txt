Document 1 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): have manifestations of lower extremity VTE and absolute contraindications to anticoagulation, those that have a bleeding complication from anticoagulation therapy of acute VTE, or those who develop recurrent DVT or PE despite adequate anticoagula-tion therapy and for patients with severe pulmonary hypertension.When possible, anticoagulation therapy should be contin-ued in patients with vena cava filters. The duration of antico-agulation is determined by the underlying VTE and not by the presence of the IVC filter itself. Practically speaking, however, many patients who require an IVC filter for recurrent VTE are the same ones who would benefit most from indefinite antico-agulation. In patients who are not able to receive anticoagulants due to recent surgery or trauma, the clinician should continually reassess if anticoagulation may be started safely at a later date.Placement of permanent IVC filters has been evaluated as an adjunct to routine anticoagulation in patients with proximal
Document 2 (Title: Prothrombin time): A significant advantage of home testing is the evidence that patient self-testing with medical support and patient self-management (where patients adjust their own anticoagulant dose) improves anticoagulant control. A meta analysis which reviewed 14 trials showed that home testing led to a reduced incidence of complications (bleeding and thrombosis) and improved the time in the therapeutic range, which is an indirect measure of anticoagulant control.
Document 3 (Title: Head Trauma (Archived) -- Treatment / Management -- Mild Head Trauma): Loss of consciousness and repeated vomiting alongside increased S100B assay Seizures, neurological deficits, and clinical evidence of depressed or skull base fractures Patients on therapeutic anticoagulation or having bleeding disorders. Age >65 years and on antiplatelet medications. This minimizes health costs, radiation hazards, and emergency overcrowding without compromising patients' safety. [23]
Document 4 (Title: Blood availability for the trauma patient-autotransfusion.): Recovery of intrathoracic and intraperitoneal blood and reinfusion by autotransfusion has been demonstrated to be safe and practical in selected trauma patients. Autotransfusion is ideally applicable to the trauma patient in whom replacement of six or fewer units of blood is required. In addition, autotransfusion provides readily available blood for patients with unusual blood types and for those in whom multiple transfusions may rapidly deplete available stores. The properties of an ideal autotransfusion device include rapid assembly, relatively low cost, ease of operation, in-line filtration, minimized air blood interface, simplified anticoagulation, and safety from air embolism and coagulopathies.
Document 5 (Title: Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia -- Treatment / Management): According to the 2018 American Society of Hematology (ASH) Guideline, an alternative anticoagulant must be initiated at the therapeutic intensity in the vast majority of patients, including the following: Any patient with a high-probability 4T score (6-8), any patient with intermediate-probability 4T score (4-5) and another indication for therapeutic anticoagulation, or any patient with intermediate-probability 4T score (4-5) and no indication for therapeutic anticoagulation, but who is not at high bleeding risk. Alternatively, a prophylactic dose of an alternative anticoagulant may be initiated in a small subset of patients who are considered to be at high risk of bleeding, provided that they do not require therapeutic anticoagulation for a different indication and they have an intermediate probability 4T score. If prophylactic anticoagulation is initiated in a patient meeting those criteria, and the immunoassay comes back positive, the patient should be switched to therapeutic anticoagulation while awaiting functional assay results.
