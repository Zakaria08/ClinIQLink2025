Document 1 (Title: Passive smoking): Risk to children Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). In his 2006 report, the US Surgeon General concludes: "The evidence is sufficient to infer a causal relationship between exposure to secondhand smoke and sudden infant death syndrome." Secondhand smoking has been estimated to be associated with 430 SIDS deaths in the United States annually. Asthma. Secondhand smoke exposure is also associated with an almost doubled risk of hospitalization for asthma exacerbation among children with asthma. Lung infections, also including more severe illness with bronchiolitis and bronchitis, and worse outcome, as well as increased risk of developing tuberculosis if exposed to a carrier. In the United States, it is estimated that secondhand smoke has been associated with between 150,000 and 300,000 lower respiratory tract infections in infants and children under 18 months of age, resulting in between 7,500 and 15,000 hospitalizations each year.
Document 2 (Title: Nicotine Addiction and Smoking: Health Effects and Interventions (Nursing) -- Risk Factors): Secondhand smoke from cigarettes and cigars also causes heart disease and lung cancer in adults and a number of health problems in infants and children, including: Asthma Respiratory infections and reactive airway Ear infections Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)
Document 3 (Title: Obstentrics_Williams): he best-documented adverse reproductive outcome from smoking is a dose-response reduction in fetal growth. Newborns of mothers who smoke weigh on average 200 g less than newborns of nonsmokers (D'Souza, 1981). Smoking doubles the risk of low birthweight and raises the risk of fetal-growth restriction two-to threefold (Werler, 1997). Even secondhand smoke increases the risk for low birthweight (Hegaard, 2006). Women who stop smoking early in pregnancy may have neonates with normal birthweights (Cliver, 1995). Other adverse outcomes associated with cigarette smoking include preterm birth, placenta previa, placenta abruption, spontaneous abortion, and sudden infant death syndrome (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 2017d). Risks of childhood asthma and obesity are also increased. Abel EL, Hannigan ]H: Maternal risk factors in fetal alcohol syndrome: provocative and permissive inluences.

Document 4 (Title: A cost-benefit/cost-effectiveness analysis of smoking cessation for pregnant women.): Research has shown that pregnant women who smoke cigarettes increase their risk of having low birthweight (LBW) infants. Recent randomized trials indicate that women who quit smoking early in pregnancy reduce their risk of delivering a LBW infant. Using various sources, we estimated the cost-effectiveness of a smoking cessation program for preventing LBW and perinatal mortality. Assuming the program would cost $30 a participant and that 15% of the participants would quit smoking, we determined that a program offered to all pregnant smokers would shift 5,876 LBW infants to normal birthweight and would cost about $4,000 for each LBW infant prevented. Since infants born to smokers are at 20% greater risk for a perinatal death, a smoking cessation program could prevent 338 deaths at a cost of $69,542 for each perinatal death averted. Compared with the costs of caring for these LBW infants in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), smoking cessation programs would save $77,807,054, or $3.31 per $1 spent. The ratio of savings to costs increases to more than six to one when we include reducing long-term care for infants with disabilities secondary to LBW in the benefits from smoking cessation programs. These findings argue for routinely including smoking cessation programs in prenatal care for smokers.
Document 5 (Title: Epidemiology Morbidity And Mortality -- Clinical Significance): These subcategories provide great insight into the health of the population and highlight any group that may be disproportionately affected. For example, a review of infant mortality in the United States from 1950 to 2010 showed that while infant mortality has substantially decreased in the past four decades, the disparity between African Americans and Whites has progressively increased, further worsened by education and income inequities. [16] Other disparities uncovered include the indirect relationship between socioeconomic status and cancer mortalities, the prevalence of asthma morbidities in inner-city areas, and the unethical targeting of smoking advertisements in low-income schools. [17] [18] [19] It is by using these types of information that stakeholders of a community or population can make better decisions on the type, target, order, and scope of an intervention to pursue, ultimately allowing for communities to properly allocate their time, money, and other resources toward the most impactful and cost-effective interventions.
