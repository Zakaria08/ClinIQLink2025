Overall median and 1 year survival rates in a series of 28 patients treated with chemotherapy for PEL were 6.2 months and 39.3%, respectively. In this study, the complete response rate (presumed to be temporary) to a standard CHOP chemotherapeutic regimen (i.e. cyclophosphamide doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) was only 10% whereas a more intensive CHO chemotherapy regimen which included high dose methotrexate and bleomycin achieved a compete response rate (presumed temporary) of 70%. A second study using CHOP-like regimens or one of these regimens plus methotrexate also produced better results with the latter regimens: 5 year survival rates for the CHOP-like and CHOP-like plus methotrexate regimens were 34.4% and 45.7%, respectively. A review of 105 PEL cases reported median survival times, 1 year, 3 year, and 5 year survival rates of",

        "content": "A case of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is reported. A 71-year-old man presented with complaint of dysuria and urinary frequency. Rectal examination and CT scan revealed a bulky mass in the rectovesical space. Transperineal needle biopsy of the tumor revealed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, large cell type, diffuse. The patient received combination chemotherapy of adriamycin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisolone and pepleomycin. After two days the tumor was marvelously reduced in size, and partial response (PR) by CT was achieved after two months. PR was sustained for two months with cyclophosphamide, vincristine and prednisolone. However, the tumor progressed gradually, and he died five months after the first treatment and two additional courses of chemotherapy. Autopsy showed a 1,700 g bulky mass in the rectovesical space. The mass was covered with peritoneum and had a fistula from rectum to central necrosis of the tumor. Nine cases of the non-Hodgkin's lymphoma with complaint of dysuria have been reported in Japan before our case, which seemed to arise from the submucosal tissue of anterior rectal wall, prostate or lymphatic tissue of rectovesical space.",

        "content": "High response and overall survival rates have been reported for second- and third-generation combination chemotherapy regimens used in the treatment of advanced intermediate- and high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Results with methotrexate with leucovorin, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone, and bleomycin (MACOP-B) chemotherapy have been particularly impressive, although this regimen produces considerable toxicity. We have devised a similar regimen, which differs from previously reported weekly regimens in that it includes etoposide given at 14-day intervals. The doses of methotrexate and prednisolone were lower in our regimen than those used in MACOP-B. Alternating cycles of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and etoposide (week 1) and methotrexate, bleomycin, and vincristine (week 2) were given for a total of 12 weeks, with continuous oral prednisolone and prophylactic antibiotics. We report here the first 61 patients entered onto this study. The overall response rate is 84% (57% complete remission [CR], 27% partial remission [PR]). With a median follow-up of 32 months for surviving patients, the actuarial overall survival at 3 years is 47%, and the failure-free survival is 45%. The dose-limiting toxicity of this regimen was mucositis. Five deaths occurred during chemotherapy, two of which were due to sepsis. The dose intensities of cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin in this regimen are considerably lower than those in MACOP-B. However, because of the inclusion of etoposide, the projected average relative dose intensity for our regimen is higher than that for MACOP-B. Our regimen has produced inferior results to those reported for MACOP-B. This may be because the addition of etoposide has failed to compensate for the lower doses of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide. Alternatively, it may reflect differences in the presenting features of the patient populations.",
