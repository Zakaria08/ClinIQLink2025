Document 1 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): Systemic che-motherapy is recommended in almost all cases of distant spread. However, unlike many other malignancies, highly selected patients with isolated, resectable metastases may benefit from resection (metastasectomy). The most common site of metasta-sis is the liver. Of patients with systemic disease, approximately 15% will have metastases limited to the liver. Of these, 20% are potentially resectable for cure. Survival is improved in these patients (20–40% 5-year survival) when compared to patients who do not undergo resection. Hepatic resection of synchronous metastases from colorectal carcinoma may be performed as a combined procedure or in two stages. The second most com-mon site of metastasis is the lung, occurring in approximately 20% of patients with colorectal carcinoma. Although very few of these patients will be potentially resectable, among those who are (about 1–2% of all colorectal cancer patients), long-term survival benefit is approximately 30% to 40%. There are
Document 2 (Title: Surgical management of patients with primary operable colorectal cancer and synchronous liver metastases.): The surgical results were analyzed of 217 patients who had undergone operation for primary colorectal cancer and were found to have synchronous liver metastases. It is recommended that patients with primary operable colorectal cancer who are found to have synchronous liver metastases should at least have an adequate resection of the primary lesion. If the primary lesion is resectable for cure and there are solitary hepatic metastases, then excision of these seems warranted. In most cases this can be accomplished by simple excision or wedge resection, although occasional cases may require lobectomy.
Document 3 (Title: Liver Metastasis -- Epidemiology): Nearly 20% to 25% of patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer will develop liver metastases, with 15% to 25% of these cases presenting with synchronous disease. [4] [5] The most common metastases originated from colorectal primaries, followed by pancreatic and breast. In females less than 50 years of age, metastatic hepatic disease originated more frequently from the breast. Metastatic liver disease in those older than 70 years old was from a gastrointestinal source; 92% of metastatic hepatic lesions were carcinomas. Of these carcinoma lesions, 75% of them were adenocarcinomas. [3] Overall, histologically confirmed hepatic metastases were more common in males than females, and most patients were older than 50 years of age.
Document 4 (Title: Colorectal cancer): Epidemiology Globally more than 1 million people get colorectal cancer every year resulting in about 715,000 deaths as of 2010 up from 490,000 in 1990. , it is the second most common cause of cancer in women (9.2% of diagnoses) and the third most common in men (10.0%) with it being the fourth most common cause of cancer death after lung, stomach, and liver cancer. It is more common in developed than developing countries. Globally incidences vary 10-fold with highest rates in Australia, New Zealand, Europe and the US and lowest rates in Africa and South-Central Asia. United States Colorectal cancer is the second highest cause of cancer occurrence and death for men and women in the United States combined. An estimated 141,210 cases were diagnosed in 2011.
Document 5 (Title: Liver Metastasis -- Continuing Education Activity): Hepatic metastases increase the morbidity and mortality of patients with another site of a primary tumor disease—metastatic hepatic tumors are more prominent than primary hepatocellular or biliary tumors, although most metastatic tumors are adenocarcinomas. The majority of publications on hepatic metastases center on managing colorectal adenocarcinoma metastases. The dual blood supply of the liver not only makes it uniquely susceptible to metastasis from gastrointestinal cancers and accessible to interventional therapies. This activity reviews the current literature on the evaluation, management, and complications of metastatic hepatic disease. It highlights the importance of an interprofessional approach in providing adequate care for affected patients.
