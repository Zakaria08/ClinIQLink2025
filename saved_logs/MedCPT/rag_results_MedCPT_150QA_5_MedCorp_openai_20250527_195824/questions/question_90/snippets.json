        "content": "The surgical results were analyzed of 217 patients who had undergone operation for primary colorectal cancer and were found to have synchronous liver metastases. It is recommended that patients with primary operable colorectal cancer who are found to have synchronous liver metastases should at least have an adequate resection of the primary lesion. If the primary lesion is resectable for cure and there are solitary hepatic metastases, then excision of these seems warranted. In most cases this can be accomplished by simple excision or wedge resection, although occasional cases may require lobectomy.",
