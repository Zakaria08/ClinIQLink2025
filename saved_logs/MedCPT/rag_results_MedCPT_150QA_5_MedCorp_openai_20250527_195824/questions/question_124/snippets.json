        "title": "Comparison of the plasma levels of apolipoproteins B and A-1, and other risk factors in men and women with premature coronary artery disease.",
        "content": "The predictors of premature coronary atherosclerosis were examined in 203 patients (99 men aged less than or equal to 50 years, and 104 women aged less than or equal to 60 years) undergoing elective diagnostic coronary arteriography. Age, cigarette smoking, hypertension, obesity, diabetes, positive family history of premature coronary artery disease (CAD), and plasma levels of total cholesterol, triglyceride, lipoproteins (i.e., very low, intermediate-, low-, and high-density [HDL] lipoproteins and their subfractions [HDL2 and HDL3], and lipoprotein [a]) and apolipoproteins (apoA-1, apoA-2 and apoB, respectively) were examined using univariate analyses and multivariate logistic regression. In men, age (p less than 0.05), smoking (p less than 0.05), and plasma triglyceride (p less than 0.02) and apoA-1 (p less than 0.05) levels were independently associated with CAD. In women, smoking (p less than 0.001) and plasma apoB levels (p less than 0.04) were the strongest variables independently associated with CAD. It is concluded that the \"nontraditional\" risk factors (plasma apoA-1 and apoB levels) are better predictors of premature CAD than are plasma lipoproteins and that smoking is the strongest of the traditional nonlipid risk factors.",

        "content": "Epicardial coronary arteries are the major site of atherosclerotic disease. The major risk factors for atherosclerosis (high levels of plasma low-density lipoprotein [LDL], low plasma high-density lipoprotein [HDL], cigarette smoking, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus [Chap. 291e]) disturb the normal functions of the vascular endothelium. These functions include local control of vascular tone, maintenance of an antithrombotic surface, and control of inflammatory cell adhesion and diapedesis. The loss of these defenses leads to inappropriate constriction, luminal thrombus formation, and abnormal interactions between blood cells, especially monocytes and platelets, and the activated vascular endothelium. Functional changes in the vascular milieu ultimately result in the subintimal collections of fat, smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, and intercellular matrix that define the atherosclerotic plaque. Rather than viewing atherosclerosis strictly as a vascular problem, it is useful to",

High LDL with low HDL level is an additional risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Measuring HDL concentration and sizes As technology has reduced costs and clinical trials have continued to demonstrate the importance of HDL, methods for directly measuring HDL concentrations and size (which indicates function) at lower costs have become more widely available and increasingly regarded as important for assessing individual risk for progressive arterial disease and treatment methods. Electrophoresis measurements Since the HDL particles have a net negative charge and vary by density & size, ultracentrifugation combined with electrophoresis have been utilized since before 1950 to enumerate the concentration of HDL particles and sort them by size with a specific volume of blood plasma. Larger HDL particles are carrying more cholesterol.",
