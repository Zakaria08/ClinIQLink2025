With your own knowledge and the help of the following document:

Document 1 (Title: Biochemistry_Lippinco): Patient Presentation: BE is a 45-year-old woman who presents with concerns about sudden (paroxysmal), intense, brief episodes of headache, sweating (diaphoresis), and a racing heart (palpitations). Focused History: BE reports that the attacks started ~3 weeks ago. They last from 2 to 10 minutes, during which time she feels quite anxious. During the attacks, it feels as though her heart is skipping beats (arrhythmia). At first, she thought the attacks were related to recent stress at work and maybe even menopause. The last time it happened, she was in a pharmacy and had her blood pressure taken. She was told it was 165/110 mm Hg. BE notes that she has lost weight (~8 lbs) in this period even though her appetite has been good.
Document 2 (Title: Chest pain): Respiratory Asthma is a common long-term inflammatory disease of the airways of the lungs. It is characterized by variable and recurring symptoms, reversible airflow obstruction, and bronchospasm. Symptoms include episodes of wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath. Chest pain usually happens during a strenuous activity or heavy exercise. Bronchitis Pulmonary embolism: Common signs and symptoms are shortness of breath, pleuritic chest pain, blood in sputum during cough, and lower limb swelling. Risk factors includes: recent surgery, malignancy, and bedridden state. Source of embolus usually comes from venous thromboembolism. Pneumonia Hemothorax
Document 3 (Title: [A case of adult Still's disease with pulmonary hypertension].): The patient was a 29-year-old woman. She was well until autumn 1983, when she presented with polyarthralgia, fever above 39 degrees C, hepatosplenomegaly, swelling of lymphnode and salmon pink rash. Laboratory tests revealed marked leucocytosis with shift to the left, elevated ESR, strong positivity of CRP and abnormal liver function tests. However, anti-nuclear antibody and RA factor were negative. She was diagnosed as adult onset Still's disease (AOSD) by characteristic clinical course and laboratory data. During her disease course these abnormal findings could be well controlled neither by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, immunosuppressive agents nor corticosteroids. Two and half years after the first admission, she began to complain of dry cough, dyspnea on efforts. Auscultation revealed an increased pulmonic sound and systolic murmur of cardiac apex. Chest X-Rays showed enlarged main pulmonary arteries. The lung fields were normal. Pulmonary function tests gave no evidence of a significant obstructive or restrictive defect but showed the low DLco and hypoxemia. Ventilation-perfusion lung scanning failed to reveal pulmonary embolism. Finally, right heart catheterization confirmed the pulmonary precapillary hypertension. Her pulmonary hypertension has progressed rapidly, strongly suggesting poor prognosis. Her pulmonary hypertension associated with no apparent parenchymal involvement was thought to be caused by a pulmonary vascular change probably related to AOSD. This case is a first case of AOSD with pulmonary hypertension.
Document 4 (Title: Case Study: 33-Year-Old Female Presents with Chronic SOB and Cough (Archived) -- Case Presentation): History of Present Illness: A 33-year-old white female presents after admission to the general medical/surgical hospital ward with a chief complaint of shortness of breath on exertion. She reports that she was seen for similar symptoms previously at her primary care physician’s office six months ago. At that time, she was diagnosed with acute bronchitis and treated with bronchodilators, empiric antibiotics, and a short course oral steroid taper. This management did not improve her symptoms, and she has gradually worsened over six months. She reports a 20-pound (9 kg) intentional weight loss over the past year. She denies camping, spelunking, or hunting activities. She denies any sick contacts. A brief review of systems is negative for fever, night sweats, palpitations, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, neural sensation changes, muscular changes, and increased bruising or bleeding. She admits a cough, shortness of breath, and shortness of breath on exertion.
Document 5 (Title: Case Study: 33-Year-Old Female Presents with Chronic SOB and Cough (Archived) -- Case Presentation -- Physical Exam:): Vitals: Temperature, 97.8 F; heart rate 88; respiratory rate, 22; blood pressure 130/86; body mass index, 28 General: She is well appearing but anxious, a pleasant female lying on a hospital stretcher. She is conversing freely, with respiratory distress causing her to stop mid-sentence. Respiratory: She has diffuse rales and mild wheezing; tachypneic. Cardiovascular: She has a regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Gastrointestinal: Bowel sounds X4. No bruits or pulsatile mass.

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
Question: A 62-year-old woman comes to the physician because of coughing and fatigue during the past 2 years. In the morning, the cough is productive of white phlegm. She becomes short of breath walking up a flight of stairs. She has hypertension and hyperlipidemia. She has recently retired from working as a nurse at a homeless shelter. She has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for 40 years. Current medications include ramipril and fenofibrate. Her temperature is 36.5°C (97.7°F), respirations are 24/min, pulse is 85/min, and blood pressure is 140/90 mm Hg. Scattered wheezing and rhonchi are heard throughout both lung fields. There are no murmurs, rubs, or gallops but heart sounds are distant. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms?
Options:
A. Chronic decrease in pulmonary compliance
B. Local accumulation of kinins
C. Progressive obstruction of expiratory airflow
D. Incremental loss of functional residual capacity
