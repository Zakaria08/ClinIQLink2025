With your own knowledge and the help of the following document:

Document 1 (Title: Jaundice): Some bone and heart disorders can lead to an increase in ALP and the aminotransferases, so the first step in differentiating these from liver problems is to compare the levels of GGT, which are only elevated in liver-specific conditions. The second step is distinguishing from biliary (cholestatic) or liver causes of jaundice and altered laboratory results. ALP and GGT levels typically rise with one pattern while aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) rise in a separate pattern. If the ALP (10–45 IU/l) and GGT (18–85 IU/l) levels rise proportionately as high as the AST (12–38 IU/l) and ALT (10–45 IU/l) levels, this indicates a cholestatic problem. If the AST and ALT rise is significantly higher than the ALP and GGT rise, though, this indicates a liver problem. Finally, distinguishing between liver causes of jaundice, comparing levels of AST and ALT can prove useful. AST levels typically are higher than ALT. This remains the case in most liver disorders
Document 2 (Title: Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) -- Evaluation): The diagnosis of NAFLD/NASH is often made incidentally when routine lab tests show abnormal liver biochemical tests or imagining tests show hepatic steatosis or hepatomegaly. Imaging modalities include ultrasonography, computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Ultrasonography, however, is most widely used as it is the least expensive and most available modality. A diagnosis of NAFLD should be made only in the absence of excessive alcohol intake (defined as alcohol consumption of more than 20 g/day for men and more than 10 g/day for women), and other causes of liver disease such as viral hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis, hereditary or drug-induced liver disease. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) are usually mildly elevated at two to five times the upper level of normal with ALT greater than AST in a 2:1 ratio. This pattern of serum aminotransferase elevation helps distinguish NAFLD from alcoholic hepatitis, as the AST is usually greater than ALT in alcoholic hepatitis in a greater than 2:1 ratio. Please note that this pattern flips in NASH with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis and the AST is usually greater than ALT in such cases. Serum alkaline phosphatase can be mildly elevated, usually up to twice the upper limit of normal. Bilirubin, albumin, and INR are usually within the normal limits but will be elevated in patients who develop cirrhosis. Ferritin can be elevated in up to 60% of patients and usually indicates more advanced disease given it is a marker of inflammation. Autoimmune antibodies such as antinuclear antibody (ANA) can be detected in low titers.
Document 3 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Laboratory Features The serum aminotransferases aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (previously designated SGOT and SGPT) increase to a variable degree during the prodromal phase of acute viral hepatitis and precede the rise in bilirubin level (Figs. 360-2 and 360-4). The level of these enzymes, however, does not correlate well with the degree of liver cell damage. Peak levels vary from 400–4000 IU or more; these levels are usually reached at the time the patient is clinically icteric and diminish progressively during the recovery phase of acute hepatitis. The diagnosis of anicteric hepatitis is based on clinical features and on aminotransferase elevations.
Document 4 (Title: Review of pyridoxal phosphate and the transaminases in liver disease.): In vitro supplementation with the active form of vitamin B6, pyridoxal-phosphate (PLP), increases measurements of both serum aminotransferase enzymes, L-aspartate: 2-oxoglutarate amino transferase, EC 2.6.1.1 (AST) and L-alanine: 2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase, EC 2.6.1.2 (ALT). The plasma PLP level in normal individuals clearly relates inversely to the degree of stimulation of serum AST and ALT. PLP added in vitro increases the reference values but does not decrease the biological variability of AST measurements in healthy individuals. Since B6 deficiency is observed in alcoholics, in some significant percentage of hospitalized patients and in apparently healthy people over age 64, these individuals will show PLP stimulation of their serum amino-transferase enzymes. Patients with liver disease show lesser activation with PLP of AST activity but not ALT activity than patients with heart disease (myocardial infarction). AST isoenzyme measurements in the form of a mitochondrial AST/total AST ratio may discriminate alcoholic hepatitis from all other hepatic diseases. In renal dialysis patients including transplant patients, it may be desirable to measure the aminotransferases with added PLP in order to reflect better the cytolytic state of the liver. While unconfirmed studies suggest the combination of PLP activation and AST isoenzyme measurements may aid in the diagnosis of hepatoma, PLP activation per se does not provide clear cut improved diagnostic value of AST and ALT in liver diseases. However, in view of PLP incorporation into the IFCC reference methods for AST and ALT, and the National Reference System for the Clinical Laboratory, it is recommended that PLP be included in all AST and ALT measurements.
Document 5 (Title: Serum transaminase levels in the acute phase of chronic extrahepatic cholestasis.): Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels are normal or discretely increased in rats with chronic extrahepatic cholestasis (CEHC). During the acute phase (first 72 h after biliary obstruction), however, serum transaminase values are quite elevated due to a mechanism not yet fully elucidated. Thus, this is a good experimental model, not involving hepatocellular necrosis, for the study of serum ALT and AST levels during the acute phase of CEHC. Male Wistar rats (250-350 g) were divided into two groups: group A (N = 60) was submitted to sham operation for bile duct ligation (BDL), and group B (N = 60) was submitted to BDL. Thirty and 120 min after BDL there was a 1.5-fold increase in both serum ALT and AST levels compared to sham-operated rats (P less than 0.05). Serum ALT levels were higher than AST levels as early as 30 min after BDL and the highest serum values for both transaminases were observed at 360 min which was also the last value measured. Serum AST levels increased 120 min after BDL, with no further significant increases thereafter.

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
Question: A previously healthy 36-year-old man comes to the physician for a yellow discoloration of his skin and dark-colored urine for 2 weeks. He does not drink any alcohol. Physical examination shows jaundice. Abdominal and neurologic examinations show no abnormalities. Serum studies show increased levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). A liver biopsy is performed and a photomicrograph after periodic acid-Schiff-staining is shown. Which of the following is the most likely additional finding in this patient?
Options:
A. Bullous changes of the lung bases on chest CT
B. Beading of intra- and extrahepatic bile ducts on ERCP
C. Myocardial iron deposition on cardiovascular MRI
D. Dark corneal ring on slit-lamp examination
