Document 1 (Title: [Pathomorphologic study on early hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)--a study of cell density in well-differentiated HCC of the early stage].): In order to clarify the histologic characteristics of well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a comparative morphometric study on cell density was performed in 15 HCCs smaller than 2 cm in diameter, 6 HCCs with marked fatty and/or clear cell change, 7 hyperplastic nodules, 5 hyperplastic nodules containing foci of HCC, and non-cancerous areas of the livers bearing small HCC. In well-differentiated HCC, marked increase of cell density accompanying by decrease of cell size and increase of nuclear cytoplasm ratio were prominent, and the cell density was approximately two times larger than that of the non-cancerous area in most cases. In HCCs with marked fatty and/or clear cell change, as an increase of cell density was not evident because of swelling of the cytoplasm due to fat and/or glycogen accumulation, it should be careful to differentiate them from non-cancerous nodular lesions including hyperplastic nodule with marked fatty change. Hyperplastic nodules could be divided into two groups; those with marked increase of cell density, and those without increase of cell density. In the former group, 5 of the 7 nodules contained cancerous foci.
Document 2 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): secondary to reduced metabolic activity within the tumor.Although the role of PET/CT in the clinical management of liver metastases has been well-established, its utility in the diagnostic workup of primary liver tumors is still debated. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), FDG uptake correlates with the degree of differentiation—high-grade HCC lesions have increased FDG uptake compared to low-grade HCCs. As a result, the overall sensitivity of FDG-PET/CT in the detection of HCCs is reported to be only 50% to 65%, rendering this modality insufficient when used alone in the diagnosis of primary HCCs. For this reason, dual-tracer PET has been introduced to improve sensitivity in detecting all HCC. This modality combines the use of FDG, which accumulates in poorly differentiated tumors, with 11C-acetate, a tracer preferentially accumulated by well-differentiated HCC lesions. Although the clinical benefits of dual-tracer PET/CT have yet to be fully established, this com-bined modality has
Document 3 (Title: Hepatocellular carcinoma): Prognosis The usual outcome is poor because only 10–20% of hepatocellular carcinomas can be removed completely using surgery. If the cancer cannot be completely removed, the disease is usually deadly within 3 to 6 months. This is partially due to late presentation with tumors, but also the lack of medical expertise and facilities in the regions with high HCC prevalence. However, survival can vary, and occasionally people survive much longer than 6 months. The prognosis for metastatic or unresectable HCC has improved due to the approval of Sorafenib (Nexavar®) for advanced HCC. Epidemiology
Document 4 (Title: Hepatocellular carcinoma): Microscopically, the four architectural and cytological types (patterns) of hepatocellular carcinoma are: fibrolamellar, pseudoglandular (adenoid), pleomorphic (giant cell), and clear cell. In well-differentiated forms, tumor cells resemble hepatocytes, form trabeculae, cords, and nests, and may contain bile pigment in the cytoplasm. In poorly differentiated forms, malignant epithelial cells are discohesive, pleomorphic, anaplastic, and giant. The tumor has a scant stroma and central necrosis because of the poor vascularization. A fifth form – lymphoepithelioma like hepatocellular carcinoma – has also been described. Staging BCLC Staging System The prognosis of HCC is affected by the staging of the tumor and the liver's function due to the effects of liver cirrhosis.
Document 5 (Title: Hepatocellular Carcinoma  -- Histopathology): Hepatocellular carcinoma is a malignant tumor of the hepatocytes. Cytological features depend on the differentiation of hepatocytes. From well-differentiated to poorly differentiated HCC. The trabecular architectural pattern is the commonest. Other patterns include pseudoacinar (acinar with proteinaceous material), compact and sarcomatoid. Histology may show variation, according to the differentiation of the tissue: Well-Differentiated: cells smaller than normal, minimal nuclear atypia, nuclear density two times of normal liver Moderately Differentiated: larger tumor cells with more eosinophilic cytoplasm, pseudoglands, distinct nucleoli, bile, and giant tumor cells Poorly Differentiated: large tumor cells with hyperchromatic nuclei prominent pleomorphism may have spindle cell or small-cell areas
