        "content": "Oro-facial pain is commonly acute, and of dental origin. There are numerous other less common, but clinically identifiable types of oro-facial pain which can be attributed to an organic cause, and which usually respond to the appropriate treatment. There is a small proportion of oro-facial pain problems, however, which are chronic and which are found to have a psychogenic element of greater or lesser magnitude, and treatment is aimed at psychological or psychiatric therapy. The interim results of an ongoing study of chronic oro-facial pain of psychogenic origin are described in this presentation.",

More recently, BMS has been described as one of the 4 recognizable symptom complexes of chronic facial pain, along with atypical facial pain, temporomandibular joint dysfunction and atypical odontalgia. BMS has been subdivided into three general types, with type two being the most common and type three being the least common. Types one and two have unremitting symptoms, whereas type three may show remitting symptoms. Type 1 - Symptoms not present upon waking, and then increase throughout the day Type 2 - Symptoms upon waking and through the day Type 3 - No regular pattern of symptoms Sometimes those terms specific to the tongue (e.g. glossodynia'') are reserved for when the burning sensation is located only on the tongue.",

TMD has been considered as a type of musculoskeletal, neuromuscular, or rheumatological disorder. It has also been called a functional pain syndrome, and a psychogenic disorder. Others consider TMD a \"central sensitivity syndrome\", in reference to evidence that TMD might be caused by a centrally mediated sensitivity to pain. It is hypothesized that there is a great deal of similarity between TMD and other pain syndromes like fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome, interstitial cystitis, headache, chronic lower back pain and chronic neck pain. These disorders have also been theorized to be caused by centrally mediated sensitivity to pain, and furthermore they often occur together.",
