        "title": "Modern war surgery: operations in an evacuation hospital during the October 1973 Arab-Israeli war.",
        "content": "A forward evacuation hospital functioned in the southern front in October 1973 Israeli-Arab War as an intermediate unit in the Israeli casualty management logistics. Casualties were characterized by frequent multiple-system injuries and variable combinations of penetrating wounds, blunt trauma, burns, and inhalation injury, with an increased incidence of associated blunt trauma. As the result of the systems organization, the EH was able to provide the wounded with early intensive and definitive resuscitation therapy which permitted further evacuation of the casualties to the central hospitals in a better state of physiological stability. In the most critically wounded when there was imminent threat to survival, operations were performed at the EH as an integral part of the resuscitation process. Performance of operations in a forward evacuation hospital did not increase the number or severity of postoperative complications. Morbidity and mortality were related to the nature and magnitude of injury.",

        "content": "use of the available clinical services and facilities. Triage requires determination of the level of emergency care needed. The higher the number and broader the range of casualties, the more complex and difficult triage becomes. The mildly wounded and victims of contamination only can be sent to evacuation, registration (with disaster response teams), and decontamination/treatment centers. Figure 263e-2 illustrates an evacuation scheme after a radiologic event causing multiple casualties. The goal of such an algorithm is to treat all possible victims of exposure and minor injury outside of the hospital setting. This approach prevents hospitals from being directly overwhelmed and enhances treatment for persons who are severely wounded. Emergency treatment should be administered initially for conventional injuries such as wounds, trauma, and thermal or chemical burns. Individuals with such injuries should be stabilized, if possible, and immediately transported to a medical facility.",

        "content": "External disasters occur at locations separate from the hospital, such as transportation incidents or industrial accidents. Disasters can be both internal and external disasters concomitantly, such as natural disasters that cause mass casualties as well as damage hospital structure. Disasters can be acute or ongoing. Acute disasters have a general time of onset of the time of an event occurring. Acute disasters have a typical patient flow, which produces numerous low acuity patients presenting to the hospital, overwhelming the surge capacity, or the number of patients the facility can care for presenting at a single time. This surge event is followed by the majority of patients presenting by personal transport and later EMS or prehospital transport of the critically ill. Peak volumes in acute disasters are expected at two to three hours post-event. Evolving disasters such as infectious pandemics have a\u00a0gradual progression to critical populations, but volumes and resource strain remain for extended periods. Disaster types can further subdivide into categories such as natural disasters, chemical disasters, and bioterrorism; each subdivision produces a specific injury or exposure profile and individual strain on resources that can guide emergency preparedness planning and response.",
