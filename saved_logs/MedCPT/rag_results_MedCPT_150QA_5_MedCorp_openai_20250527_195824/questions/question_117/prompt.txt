Document 1 (Title: Reciprocal creatinine slopes often give erroneous estimates of progression of chronic renal failure.): In 10 of 22 observation periods (lasting an average of 15 months) in 17 patients with moderate to severe chronic renal failure (GFR 4 to 23 ml/min), rates of progression as estimated from the linear regression on time of reciprocal plasma creatinine concentration (multiplied by average 24 hr creatinine excretion) (b2) differed significantly from rates of progression as estimated from the regression on time of urinary clearance of 99mTc-DTPA (b1), during all or part of the period of observation, b2 exceeded b1 in six cases and was less than b1 in the other four. Owing to these changes, measurements of reciprocal creatinine concentration gave erroneous impressions of the rate or existence of progression, during all or a portion of the period of observation, in nearly half of these patients. However, in the 22 studies as a group, using the entire periods of observation, b2 indicated nearly the same mean rate of progression as b1, and had the same variance. We conclude that sequential plasma or serum creatinine measurements in individual patients are often misleading as measures of progression and should, when feasible, be replaced by urinary clearances of isotopes in following patients with chronic renal failure.
Document 2 (Title: Kidney failure): In the United States acute failure affects about 3 per 1,000 people a year. Chronic failure affects about 1 in 1,000 people with 3 per 10,000 people newly developing the condition each year. Acute failure is often reversible while chronic failure often is not. With appropriate treatment many with chronic disease can continue working. Classification Kidney failure can be divided into two categories: acute kidney failure or chronic kidney failure. The type of renal failure is differentiated by the trend in the serum creatinine; other factors that may help differentiate acute kidney failure from chronic kidney failure include anemia and the kidney size on sonography as chronic kidney disease generally leads to anemia and small kidney size. Acute kidney failure
Document 3 (Title: End-Stage Renal Disease -- Pathophysiology): Each nephron in a normal kidney contributes to the total glomerular filtration rate (GFR). The decline of kidney function is gradual and may initially present asymptomatically. The natural history of renal failure depends on the etiology of the disease but ultimately involves early homeostatic mechanisms involving hyperfiltration of the nephrons. The kidney maintains GFR, despite the progressive destruction of nephrons because the remaining normal nephrons develop hyperfiltration and compensatory hypertrophy. As a result, the patient with mild renal impairment can show normal creatinine values, and the disease can go undetected for some time. [24]
Document 4 (Title: First_Aid_Step2): Labs may show concurrent hypocalcemia and hypokalemia. ECG may reveal prolonged PR and QT intervals. IV and oral supplements. Hypokalemia and hypocalcemia will not correct without magnesium correction. See Figure 2.16-2 for a diagnostic algorithm of acid-base disorders. A net ↓ in either tubular H+ secretion or HCO3 reabsorption that leads to a non–anion gap metabolic acidosis. There are three main types of RTA; type IV (distal) is the most common form (see Table 2.16-2). An abrupt ↓ in renal function leading to the retention of creatinine and BUN. ↓ urine output (oliguria, defined as < 500 cc/day) is not required for ARF. ARF is categorized as follows (see also Table 2.16-3): Prerenal: ↓ renal perfusion. Intrinsic: Injury within the nephron unit. Postrenal: Urinary outﬂow obstruction. Generally, both kidneys must be obstructed before one can see a significant ↑ in BUN and creatinine. Alcoholics are the most common patient population with hypomagnesemia.
Document 5 (Title: First_Aid_Step2): Azotemia (↑ BUN and creatinine). Fluid retention (hypertension, edema, CHF, pulmonary edema). Metabolic acidosis. Hyperkalemia. Anemia of chronic disease (↓ erythropoietin production). Hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia (↓ phosphate excretion; impaired vitamin D production leading to renal osteodystrophy). ACEIs/ARBs and hypertension control have been shown to ↓ the progression of CKD. Additional pharmacotherapy is as follows: Erythropoietin analogs for anemia of chronic disease. Fluid restriction; low Na+/K+/phosphate intake. Oral phosphate binders and calcitriol (1,25-OH vitamin D) for renal osteodystrophy. Renal replacement therapy includes hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, and renal transplantation.
