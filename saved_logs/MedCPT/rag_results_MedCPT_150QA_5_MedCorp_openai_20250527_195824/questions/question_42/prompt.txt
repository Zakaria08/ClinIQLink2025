Document 1 (Title: Patent Foramen Ovale -- Differential Diagnosis): As mentioned earlier, PFO is a common finding in newborns and adults; the major differential diagnosis includes other congenital heart diseases like: Atrial septal defect ( In contrast with PFO, there is an actual defect in the septum, and usually fixed split-second heart sound is heard on examination) Ventricular septal defect ( Membrenous or muscular, usually associated with pansystolic murmur) Patent ductus arteriosus (another shunt that exists in fetal life as part of the fetal circulation may remain patent in newborns, and very few may stay patent into childhood. It is usually associated with continuous machinery murmur)
Document 2 (Title: Trilogy of Fallot): The Trilogy of Fallot also called Fallot's trilogy is a rare congenital heart disease consisting of the following defects: pulmonary valve stenosis, right ventricular hypertrophy and atrial septal defect. It occurs in 1.2% of all congenital heart defects. A 1960 case report of 22 patients who underwent surgery showed an excess of females with a ratio of 3:2, with the youngest person being 7 months old and the oldest being 50 years old. Symptoms and signs Mechanism Trilogy of Fallot is a combination of three congenital heart defects: pulmonary stenosis, right ventricular hypertrophy, and an atrial septal defect. The first two of these are also found in the more common tetralogy of Fallot. However, the tetralogy has a ventricular septal defect instead of an atrial one, and it also involves an overriding aorta The Three Malformations Diagnosis Diagnosis is done via echocardiography or angiography.
Document 3 (Title: Obstentrics_Williams): The rubella virus is one of the most complete teratogens, and efects of fetal infection are worst during organogenesis (Adams Waldorf, 2013). Pregnant women with rubella and a rash during the first 12 weeks of gestation have an afected fetus with congenital infection in up to 90 percent of cases (Miller, 1982). At 13 to 14 weeks' gestation, this incidence is 50 percent, and by the end of the second trimester, it is 25 percent. Defects are rare after 20 weeks' gestation. Features of congenital rubella syndrome amenable to prenatal diagnosis are cardiac septal defects, pulmonary stenosis, microcephaly, cataracts, microphthalmia, and hepatosplenomegaly (Yazigi, 2017). Other abnormalities include sensorineural deafness, intellectual disability, neonatal purpura, and radiolucent bone disease. Neonates born with congenital rubela may shed the virus or many months and thus be a threat to other inants and to susceptible adults who contact them. Reports of delayed morbidities associated with
Document 4 (Title: Tetralogy of Fallot, cardiac hypertrophy, pulmonary hypertension, and anomalies of great vessels in fetuses and neonates of WKY/NCrj rats.): We examined anatomically the hearts, lungs, and great vessels of 269 WKY/NCrj rats at three fetal and three neonatal stages. Severe pulmonary valve thickening was present in 16 and ventricular septal defects with overriding of the aorta in 15 of the 90 near-term fetuses and in 10 and nine, respectively, of the 79 neonates at 2-4 d of age. These abnormalities occurred together (tetralogy of Fallot) in seven of the near-term fetuses and in five of the neonates. A narrow pulmonary outflow tract was present in 55% of the fetuses and in 56% of the neonates. The wall of the pulmonary arterial branch was abnormally thick in 19% of the fetuses and in 26% of the neonates, most of which did not have septal defects. In about 80% of the fetuses, the middle latitudinal muscle bundle of the ventricular septum was not continuous with the left ventricular free wall, but rather with the right; after birth, it was discontinuous with both free walls. The heart was abnormally heavy in 49% of the 79 neonates. In about half of the heavy hearts, there were no septal defects or pulmonary valvular and arterial lesions. There were double aortic arches in four and right aortic arches in six of the total WKY fetuses and neonates; the ductus arteriosus was abnormally small in 47% and the aorta was large in 51% of the near-term fetuses. This constellation of congenital heart disease is genetic in origin, but altered by hemodynamics late in fetal life.
Document 5 (Title: [The incidence of heart defects in children].): By examining all of 91,823 children born in 1980 in Bohemia, congenital heart disease was proved in 589 (6.415/1000 liveborns) and cardiomyopathy in 24 (0.261/1000 liveborns). Further 166 (1.808/1000 liveborns) were follow-up with a diagnosis of congenital heart disease by pediatric cardiologists in the field, but at the age of 4 years we didn't prove the defect any more. Prevalence of heart defects: ventricular septal defect (31.4%), atrial septal defect (11.4%), aortic stenosis (7.6%), pulmonary stenosis (7.1%), coarctation of the aorta (5.8%), transposition of the great arteries (5.4%), patent ductus arteriosus (4.8%), atrioventricular canal and hypoplastic left heart (4.1%), tetralogy of Fallot (3.6%). Other defects occurred less frequently than in 2.5% of all congenital heart disease.

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
Question: A male neonate is being examined by a pediatrician. His mother informs the doctor that she had a mild fever with rash, muscle pain, and swollen and tender lymph nodes during the second month of gestation. The boy was born at 39 weeks gestation via spontaneous vaginal delivery with no prenatal care. On physical examination, the neonate has normal vital signs. Retinal examination reveals the findings shown in the image. Which of the following congenital heart defects is most likely to be present in this neonate?
Options:
A. Atrial septal defect
B. Ventricular septal defect
C. Tetralogy of Fallot
D. Patent ductus arteriosus
