Document 1 (Title: Dust Mite Allergy -- Differential Diagnosis): Other than dust mites, house dust allergy can be caused by the following allergen sources: Mold. The fungus grows in a humid environment like house basements, kitchens, gardens, and bathrooms. The spores of the mold become airborne, which on inhalation leads to allergic rhinitis. Cockroaches. These are found in a variety of environments. The saliva, fecal matter, and shed off parts of cockroaches serve as potential allergens for triggering allergies. Around 68 percent of households in the USA are known to have cockroach allergens. The percentage increases further in urban areas. Pollen. Flowers, grass, weeds, and trees are sources of pollens that constitute an essential component of household dust. These are a common cause for triggering allergic reactions. Pets. Fur, feathers, animal hair, dander, saliva, and fecal matter all serve as allergens. [31] Dust mite allergy can be confused with non-allergic forms of rhinitis. [32] These include the following:

Document 3 (Title: Grass pollen allergens: detection on pollen grain surface using membrane print technique.): A microtechnique is described to visualize pollen allergens by making prints from the surface of mature grains on nitrocellulose membrane. The allergen Lol p I is detected by specific monoclonal antibodies or specific IgE from sera of grass-pollen-allergic patients, visualized by the immunoperoxidase method. This technique offers the potential to study the distribution of individual allergens in aerobiology samples by bright-field microscopy, and to determine the sensitivity spectra of allergic individuals to known and unknown pollen sources.
Document 4 (Title: Immunology_Janeway): underlying some prototypic immunologic reactions, it is now becoming clear that most normal and pathologic host immune responses involve both the humoral and cellular arms of the immune system, and that the definitions provided in Chapter 11 for types 1, 2, and 3 immune response modules provide a more thorough mechanistic context for understanding disease pathogenesis, including allergic responses (see Fig. 11.5). In most allergic reactions, such as those to food, pollen, or house dust, reactions occur because the individual has become sensitized to an innocuous anti-gen—the allergen—by producing IgE antibodies against it. This is usually a result of the formation of an unwanted type 2 immune response to the allergen. Subsequent exposure to the allergen triggers the activation of IgE-binding cells, chiefly mast cells and basophils, in the exposed tissue, leading to a series of responses that are characteristic of this type of allergic reaction. In hay fever (allergic
Document 5 (Title: Common airborne allergens and their clinical relevance in the Caracas valley.): In order to determine the sequential prevalence of pollen grains and fungi spores in the city of Caracas by the volumetric method of collection and its effect on the population at risk, the first multidisciplinary team of aerobiological research was structured through a protocol designed for five experimental stages namely: a) Determination of the climatological parameters: temperature, relative humidity, speed and wind direction, precipitation and atmospheric stability, through simultaneous records of meteorological status located in the metropolitan area of Caracas; b) Collection, identification, classification and determination of the local distribution of the most important pollen grains existing in the zone under study; c) Collection, identification and classification of the most important fungi spores in the area; d) Preparation of the first pollinic calendar of Caracas and e) Evaluation of possible implication of the environment and the response through the IgE antibody in the selected patients in the area under study. Our results show: 1) The climatic conditions existing during the sampling period coincide with the analysis of the last 20 years in the Valley of Caracas. 2) The Venezuelan Central University (UCV) station was elected as the most representative point for permanent sampling. 3) An ideal statistical method is obtained in order to determine the spatial arrangement in the sampler rod of a dense type of fungi spores typical of the area under study. 4) The first pollinic calendar of Caracas was structured and 5) A seasonal tendency of the IgE response is shown. These results suggest an evident interrelation between the suggested concept of polyseasonality and antigenic polysensitization, and between individual seasonality with a specific reactivity and, finally, between tropical mixed seasonality with the expression of combined respiratory pathologies in our environment.
