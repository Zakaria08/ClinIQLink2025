With your own knowledge and the help of the following document:

Document 1 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): Achilles J. Pappano, PhD JH, a 63-year-old architect, complains of urinary symptoms to his family physician. He has hypertension, and during the last 8 years, he has been adequately managed with a thiazide diuretic and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. During the same period, JH developed the signs of benign prostatic hypertrophy, which eventually required prostatectomy to relieve symptoms. He now complains that he has an increased urge to urinate as well as urinary fre-quency, and this has disrupted the pattern of his daily life. What do you suspect is the cause of JH’s problem? What information would you gather to confirm your diagnosis? What treatment steps would you initiate?
Document 2 (Title: Finasteride): Enlarged prostate Physicians sometimes prescribe finasteride for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), informally known as an enlarged prostate. Finasteride may improve the symptoms associated with BPH such as difficulty urinating, getting up during the night to urinate, hesitation at the start and end of urination, and decreased urinary flow. It provides less symptomatic relief than alpha-1 blockers such as tamsulosin and symptomatic relief is slower in onset (six months or more of treatment with finasteride may be required to determine the therapeutic results of treatment). Symptomatic benefits are mainly seen in those with prostate volume > 40 cm3. In long-term studies finasteride but not alpha-1 inhibitors reduce the risk of acute urinary retention (−57% at 4 years) and the need for surgery (−54% at 4 years). If the drug is discontinued, any therapeutic benefits are reversed within about 6–8 months.
Document 3 (Title: [Paraplegia after spinal anesthesia].): A case of paraplegia occurring after a spinal anaesthetic is reported. The 79-year-old man was admitted for a fractured neck of femur. Twenty years previously, he had had pharyngeal surgery and a tracheostomy. He had also undergone a prostatectomy for prostate cancer, and had been on oestrogen therapy for two years. He complained of dyspnoea at rest and his chest film showed diffuse pulmonary opacities. In order to avoid possible intubation and respiratory complications, spinal anaesthesia was performed without any problems in the L4 space. After the surgery, the patient recovered all his motor and sensory functions in the lower limbs. On the second postoperative day, he suffered from a motor paralysis of the right leg, which spread to the left leg on the fourth day. NMR imaging showed several vertebral metastases, together with anterior and lateral epidural invasion responsible for cord compression. Treatment with tetracosactide was begun, but the patient died six weeks later in his home, not having recovered any neurological function at all in his lower limbs. In fact, it was only after the procedure that the anaesthetist was informed that, at the time the prostate cancer had been diagnosed, vertebral body metastases, of which the patient had not been informed, were already present. The part played by the spinal anaesthetic in the occurrence of the paraplegia is not clear. It is reminded that such a technique should be used with extreme care in patients having a neoplasm with a very often high incidence of vertebral metastases.
Document 4 (Title: 38-Year-Old Male Presents With Lower Extremity Edema -- Case Presentation): A 38-year-old African American male, who emigrated from Somalia 10 years ago, presented with a 6-month history of lower extremity swelling, 20-pound (9 kg) weight gain over 4 weeks, and new-onset microscopic hematuria. He had no prior history of edema, proteinuria, or hematuria. There was no prior history of any systemic illness or any heart, lung, or kidney disease. He reported no over-the-counter drug use, herbal medication use, or NSAID intake. His review of systems was positive for lethargy, fatigue, and edema at his lower extremities. His family history was negative for any kidney disease. He reported a monogamous relationship with his wife and no current or past alcohol or drug use. His medical history included recently diagnosed hypertension, latent tuberculosis, and anemia. His vital signs included a blood pressure of 160/90 and a heart rate of 78.
Document 5 (Title: Case Study: 24-Year-Old Male Presenting With Polyarthralgias (Archived) -- Case Presentation): A 24-year-old white male with no known medical history presented to the hospital with chief complaints of 2 weeks of progressively worsening pain and swelling of his right wrist and left ankle joints. He did not report any fevers, chills, night sweats, weight loss or rash. He was employed as a fireman. He denied alcohol use disorder, smoking cigarettes, or any recreational drugs. Family history was significant for hypertension in father and ovarian cancer in the mother. His vital signs were within normal limits on presentation. On physical examination, the patient had significant swelling of multiple joints including the right wrist, right elbow, and left ankle. The joints were erythematous and tender to touch. Due to severe pain, he had limited range in the involved joints.

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
Question: A 76-year-old African American man presents to his primary care provider complaining of urinary frequency. He wakes up 3-4 times per night to urinate while he previously only had to wake up once per night. He also complains of post-void dribbling and difficulty initiating a stream of urine. He denies any difficulty maintaining an erection. His past medical history is notable for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and gout. He takes aspirin, atorvastatin, enalapril, and allopurinol. His family history is notable for prostate cancer in his father and lung cancer in his mother. He has a 15-pack-year smoking history and drinks alcohol socially. On digital rectal exam, his prostate is enlarged, smooth, and non-tender. Which of the following medications is indicated in this patient?
Options:
A. Hydrochlorothiazide
B. Midodrine
C. Oxybutynin
D. Tamsulosin
