Document 1 (Title: NADPH-dependent beta-oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids with double bonds extending from odd-numbered carbon atoms.): The mitochondrial metabolism of 5-enoyl-CoAs, which are formed during the beta-oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids with double bonds extending from odd-numbered carbon atoms, was studied with mitochondrial extracts and purified enzymes of beta-oxidation. Metabolites were identified spectrophotometrically and by high performance liquid chromatography. 5-cis-Octenoyl-CoA, a putative metabolite of linolenic acid, was efficiently dehydrogenated by medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (EC 1.3.99.3) to 2-trans-5-cis-octadienoyl-CoA, which was isomerized to 3,5-octadienoyl-CoA either by mitochondrial delta 3,delta 2-enoyl-CoA isomerase (EC 5.3.3.8) or by peroxisomal trifunctional enzyme. Further isomerization of 3,5-octadienoyl-CoA to 2-trans-4-trans-octadienoyl-CoA in the presence of soluble extracts of either rat liver or rat heart mitochondria was observed and attributed to a delta 3,5,delta 2,4-dienoyl-CoA isomerase. Qualitatively similar results were obtained with 2-trans-5-trans-octadienoyl-CoA formed by dehydrogenation of 5-trans-octenoyl-CoA. 2-trans-4-trans-Octadienoyl-CoA was a substrate for NADPH-dependent 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase (EC 1.3.1.34). A soluble extract of rat liver mitochondria catalyzed the isomerization of 2-trans-5-cis-octadienoyl-CoA to 2-trans-4-trans-octadienoyl-CoA, which upon addition of NADPH, NAD+, and CoA was chain-shortened to hexanoyl-CoA, butyryl-CoA, and acetyl-CoA. Thus we conclude that odd-numbered double bonds, like even-numbered double bonds, can be reductively removed during the beta-oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids.
Document 2 (Title: Biochemistry_Lippinco): Unsaturated fatty acid β-oxidation: The oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids generates intermediates that cannot serve as substrates for 2,3-enoyl CoA hydratase (see Fig. 16.17). Consequently, additional enzymes are required. Oxidation of a double bond at an odd-numbered carbon, such as 18:1(9) (oleic acid), requires one additional enzyme, 3,2-enoyl CoA isomerase, which converts the 3-cis derivative obtained after three rounds of β-oxidation to the 2-trans derivative required by the hydratase. Oxidation of a double bond at an even-numbered carbon, such as 18:2(9,12) (linoleic acid), requires an NADPH-dependent 2,4-dienoyl CoA reductase in addition to the isomerase. [Note: Because unsaturated fatty acids are less reduced than saturated fatty acids, fewer reducing equivalents are produced by their oxidation.] 8.
Document 3 (Title: Biochemistry, Fatty Acid Oxidation -- Molecular Level): Steps 1 through 4 refer to the beta-oxidation of a saturated fatty acid with an even-numbered carbon skeleton. Unsaturated fatty acids, such as oleate (18:1) and linoleate (18:2), contain cis double bonds that must be isomerized to the trans configuration (enoyl CoA isomerase) or reduced at the expense of an NADPH molecule (2,4-dienoyl CoA reductase).
Document 4 (Title: Biochemistry, Fatty Acid Oxidation -- Molecular Level): Step 1. The first enzyme required is called acyl CoA dehydrogenase, and like other enzymes involved in the handling of fatty acids, it is specific to chain length. Members of this enzyme family include long-chain, medium-chain, and short-chain acyl CoA dehydrogenases (LCAD), (MCAD), and (SCAD), respectively. These enzymes catalyze the formation of a trans double bond between the alpha and beta carbons on acyl CoA molecules by removing two electrons to produce one molecule of FAD(H2), which eventually accounts for 1.5 ATP molecules produced in the electron transport chain (ETC).
Document 5 (Title: Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase): Acyl-CoA dehydrogenases (ACADs) are a class of enzymes that function to catalyze the initial step in each cycle of fatty acid β-oxidation in the mitochondria of cells. Their action results in the introduction of a trans double-bond between C2 (α) and C3 (β) of the acyl-CoA thioester substrate. Flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) is a required co-factor in addition to the presence of an active site glutamate in order for the enzyme to function. The following reaction is the oxidation of the fatty acid by FAD to afford an α,β-unsaturated fatty acid thioester of Coenzyme A: ACADs can be categorized into three distinct groups based on their specificity for short-, medium-, or long-chain fatty acid acyl-CoA substrates. While different dehydrogenases target fatty acids of varying chain length, all types of ACADs are mechanistically similar. Differences in the enzyme occur based on the location of the active site along the amino acid sequence.
Document 6 (Title: Biochemistry_Lippinco): 7.2. Which one of the following statements concerning dietary fat is correct? A. Coconut oil is rich in monounsaturated fats, and olive oil is rich in saturated fats. B. Fatty acids containing trans double bonds, unlike the naturally occurring cis isomers, raise high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. C. The polyunsaturated fatty acids linoleic and linolenic acids are required components. D. Triacylglycerols obtained from plants generally contain less unsaturated fatty acids than do those from animals. Correct answer = C. Humans are unable to make linoleic and linolenic fatty acids. Consequently, these fatty acids are essential in the diet. Coconut oil is rich in saturated fats, and olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fats. Trans fatty acids raise plasma levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, not high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Triacylglycerols obtained from plants generally contain more unsaturated fatty acids than do those from animals.
Document 7 (Title: Lipid metabolism): In the cytosol of the cell (for example a muscle cell), the glycerol will be converted to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, which is an intermediate in the glycolysis, to get further oxidized and produce energy. However, the main steps of fatty acids catabolism occur in the mitochondria. Long chain fatty acids (more than 14 carbon) need to be converted to fatty acyl-CoA in order to pass across the mitochondria membrane. Fatty acid catabolism begins in the cytoplasm of cells as acyl-CoA synthetase uses the energy from cleavage of an ATP to catalyze the addition of coenzyme A to the fatty acid. The resulting acyl-CoA cross the mitochondria membrane and enter the process of beta oxidation. The main products of the beta oxidation pathway are acetyl-CoA (which is used in the citric acid cycle to produce energy), NADH and FADH. The process of beta oxidation requires the following enzymes: acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, enoyl-CoA hydratase, 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, and 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase.
Document 8 (Title: Metabolism of 5(S)-hydroxy-6,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid and other 5(S)-hydroxyeicosanoids by a specific dehydrogenase in human polymorphonuclear leukocytes.): Human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL) convert 6-trans isomers of leukotriene B4 (LTB4) to dihydro metabolites (Powell, W.S., and Gravelle, F. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 2170-2177). In the present study we investigated the mechanism for the initial step in the formation of these products. We found that the 1,500 x g supernatant fraction from human PMNL converts 12-epi-6-trans-LTB4 to its 5-oxo metabolite which was identified by mass spectrometry and UV spectrophotometry. The latter compound was subsequently converted to the corresponding dihydro-oxo product, which was further metabolized to 6,11-dihydro-12-epi-6-trans-LTB4, which was the major product after longer incubation times. The 5-hydroxyeicosanoid dehydrogenase activity is localized in the microsomal fraction and requires NADP+ as a cofactor. These experiments therefore suggest that the initial step in the formation of dihydro metabolites of 6-trans isomers of LTB4 is oxidation of the 5-hydroxyl group by a microsomal dehydrogenase. Studies with a variety of substrates revealed that the microsomal dehydrogenase in human PMNL oxidizes the hydroxyl groups of a number of other eicosanoids which contain a 5(S)-hydroxyl group followed by a 6-trans double bond. There is little or no oxidation of hydroxyl groups in the 8-, 9-, 11-, 12-, or 15-positions of eicosanoids, or of the 5-hydroxyl group of LTB4, which has a 6-cis rather than a 6-trans double bond. The preferred substrate for this enzyme is 5(S)-hydroxy-6,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid (5(S)-HETE) (Km, 0.2 microM), which is converted to 5-oxo-6,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid. Unlike 5(S)-HETE, 5(R)-HETE is a poor substrate for the 5(S)-hydroxyeicosanoid dehydrogenase, indicating that in addition to exhibiting a high degree of positional specificity, this enzyme is also highly stereospecific. In addition to 5(S)-HETE and 6-trans isomers of LTB4, 5,15-diHETE is also a good substrate for this enzyme, being converted to 5-oxo-15-hydroxy-6,8,11,13-eicosatetraenoic acid (5-oxo-15-hydroxy-ETE). The oxidation of 5(S)-HETE to 5-oxo-ETE is reversible since human PMNL microsomes stereospecifically reduce 5-oxo-ETE to the 5(S)-hydroxy compound in the presence of NADPH. 5-Oxo-ETE is formed rapidly from 5(S)-HETE by intact human PMNL, but because of the reversibility of the reaction, its concentration only reaches about 25% that of 5(S)-HETE.
Document 9 (Title: Long-chain-fatty-acid—CoA ligase): In step one, ATP and a long chain fatty acid enter the enzyme’s active site. Within the active site the negatively charged oxygen on the fatty acid attacks the alpha phosphate on ATP, forming an ATP-long chain fatty acid intermediate. (Step 1, Figure 2) In the second step, Pyrophosphate (PPi) leaves, resulting in an AMP-long chain fatty acid molecule within the enzyme’s active site. (Step 2, Figure 2) Coenzyme A now enters the enzyme and another intermediate is formed which consists of AMP-long chain fatty acid-Coenzyme A. (Step 3, Figure 2) At the end of this mechanism two products are released, AMP and acyl coa synthetase. (Step 4, Figure 2) Acyl CoA is formed from long chain fatty acids through an acyl substitution. In an ATP dependent reaction, the fatty acid carboxylate is converted to a thioester. The final products of this reaction are acyl-CoA, pyrophosphate (PPi) and AMP. Structure
Document 10 (Title: Biochemistry, Fatty Acid Oxidation -- Fundamentals): Mitochondrial beta-oxidation can be used to supply acetyl coenzyme A (CoA) to 2 separate pathways, depending on which tissue oxidation occurs. In skeletal and cardiac muscle, mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation leads to substrate production for the tricarboxylic acid cycle in the form of acetyl CoA and provides adenosine triphosphate (ATP) for the myocytes. However, in hepatocytes, fatty acid oxidation provides acetyl CoA for ketone body synthesis during prolonged fasting conditions, in which glycogen stores have been depleted. Mitochondrial beta-oxidation yields 4 ATP equivalents per round of oxidation in the form of one flavin adenine dinucleotide, FAD(2H) molecule and 1 nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (reduced, NADH) molecule, as well as one acetyl CoA molecule.
Document 11 (Title: Biochemistry_Lippinco): A fatty acid, generally a linear hydrocarbon chain with a terminal carboxyl group, can be saturated or unsaturated. Two unsaturated fatty acids are dietary essentials: linoleic and α-linolenic acids. Fatty acids are synthesized in the liver cytosol following a meal containing excess carbohydrate and protein. Carbons used to synthesize fatty acids are provided by acetyl coenzyme A (CoA), energy by ATP, and reducing equivalents by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate ([NADPH], Fig. 16.25) provided by the pentose phosphate pathway and malic enzyme. Citrate carries two-carbon acetyl units from the mitochondrial matrix to the cytosol. The regulated step in fatty acid synthesis is the carboxylation of acetyl CoA to malonyl CoA by biotin-and ATP-requiring acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC). Citrate allosterically activates ACC, and palmitoyl CoA inhibits it. ACC can also be activated by insulin and inactivated by adenosine monophosphate–activated protein kinase (AMPK) in response to
Document 12 (Title: Trans-2-enoyl-CoA reductase (NADPH)): In enzymology, a (NADPH) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction trans-2,3-dehydroacyl-CoA + NADPH + H+ acyl-CoA + NADP+ Thus, the three substrates of this enzyme are , NADPH, and H+, whereas its two products are acyl-CoA and NADP+. This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-CH group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is acyl-CoA:NADP+ trans-2-oxidoreductase. Other names in common use include NADPH-dependent trans-2-enoyl-CoA reductase, reductase, trans-enoyl coenzyme A, and trans-2-enoyl-CoA reductase (NADPH). This enzyme participates in fatty acid elongation in mitochondria and polyunsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis. References EC 1.3.1 NADPH-dependent enzymes Enzymes of known structure
Document 13 (Title: Enoyl CoA isomerase): This enzyme has an important role in the metabolism of unsaturated fatty acids in beta oxidation. Mechanism Enoyl-CoA isomerase is involved in the beta-oxidation, one of the most frequently used pathways in fatty acid degradation, of unsaturated fatty acids with double bonds at odd-numbered carbon positions. It does so by shifting the position of the double bonds in the acyl-CoA intermediates and converting 3-cis or trans-enoyl-CoA to 2-trans-enoyl-CoA. Since the key step in the degradation of fatty acids with double bonds at even-numbered carbon positions also produces 3-trans-enoyl-CoA in mammals and yeasts, enoyl-CoA isomerase is technically required for their metabolism as well. The reaction mechanism is detailed in figure 1, and the base that initiates the isomerization and NH groups that stabilize the intermediate are located on the active site of enoyl-coA isomerase.
Document 14 (Title: 2,4-Dienoyl-coenzyme A reductase deficiency: a possible new disorder of fatty acid oxidation.): Several inherited disorders of fatty acid beta-oxidation have been described that relate mainly to saturated precursors. This study is the first report of an enzyme defect related only to unsaturated fatty acid oxidation and provides the first in vivo evidence that fat oxidation in humans proceeds by the reductase-dependent pathway. The patient was a black female, presenting in the neonatal period with persistent hypotonia. Biochemical studies revealed hyperlysinemia, hypocarnitinemia, normal organic acid profile, and an unusual acylcarnitine species in both urine and blood. The new metabolite was positively identified by mass spectrometry as 2-trans,4-cis-decadienoylcarnitine, derived from incomplete oxidation of linoleic acid. In spite of dietary therapy, the patient died of respiratory acidosis at four months of age. Samples of liver and muscle from the autopsy were assayed for 2,4-dienoyl-coenzyme A reductase activity. Using the substrate 2-trans,4-cis-decadienoylcoenzyme A, the reductase activity was 40% of the control value in liver and only 17% of that found in normal muscle. It is suggested that unsaturated substrates should be used for in vitro testing to cover the full range of potential beta-oxidation defects and that acylcarnitine species identification be used for in vivo detection of this disorder.
Document 15 (Title: Biochemistry, Fatty Acid Oxidation -- Molecular Level): In a similar fashion to previous sections, the process and enzymatic steps of the beta-oxidation spiral will primarily undergo discussion with alternative oxidation pathways mentioned later as they pertain to and produce metabolic products destined for mitochondrial beta-oxidation. Variations of fatty acid molecular structure and additional required enzymes will also be discussed. Mitochondrial beta-oxidation of fatty acids requires four steps, all of which occur in the mitochondrial matrix, to produce three energy storage molecules per round of oxidation, including one NADH, one FAD(H2), and one acetyl CoA molecule.
