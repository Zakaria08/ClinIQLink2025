        "content": "A study of an HPLC method for the analysis of related substances in triamcinolone acetonide is described. Several systems of solvents and samples of different lots and preparative origins were examined and a rapid-scanning diode array UV detector (DAD) was particularly useful. With the proposed technique it was possible to identify 9 alpha-bromo desonide as a principal impurity, which was present in all examined samples of triamcinolone acetonide. This identification was rendered possible by the investigation of the second derivative of the UV spectra and by means of study of the mass spectrum. Furthermore, it was possible, primarily on the basis of the spectrophotometric data, to formulate reliable hypotheses on the possible identification of 9 beta, 11 beta-epoxide of the desonide which was present at very low levels and to exclude the presence of 11-deoxy-9(11)-unsaturated desonide. The presence of the above-mentioned related substances was explained considering the scheme of synthesis described in the literature. The spectrophotometric characteristics of the studied compounds and the limits of applicability of the present procedure are discussed.",

The indirect determination of alcohols by their effect on methylene blue concentration distribution is demonstrated, and an investigation is made into the conditions for high sensitivity. Because the source exhibits low noise, the detection limits for alcohols are as low as more complex and expensive detection methods, despite the lower radiant power of the LED.

        "content": "Three cases are described. Case 1: kinetic studies often need high time resolution measurements in order to follow the pattern of reactions taking place during the experiment. This is often laborious to achieve with the collection of fractions for chromatographic separation. Some tool for separation is, however, necessary in order to decompose the concentrations of reactants, products and intermediate species. The spectra of the intermediates may not be known at the time when the kinetic studies are needed. With unknown spectra there are still possibilities to use spectroscopy and multivariate techniques to obtain qualitative information. Case 2: it is possible to use Partial Least Squares (PLS) in order to describe the chromatographic profiles for the species even if the separation is insufficient for traditional peak measurement methods. This requires that mixtures are available with known concentrations of the species to be determined. Case 3: with modern diode array liquid chromatography detectors there is the possibility to capture the chromatogram and the spectra at the same time. The ability to reproduce the chromatographic profile between samples makes it possible to use the Generalized Rank Annihilation Method (GRAM) possible. Whereas PLS only treats one spectrum at a time, this method treats the full two-dimensional chromatogram as an entity. The GRAM calibration is claimed to be insensitive to interfering species which are not present in the calibration. Limitations are that GRAM requires a linear detector response and very good repeatability of the retention time. The use of GRAM for calibration with real samples is demonstrated.",
