The majority of Rickettsia bacteria are susceptible to antibiotics of the tetracycline group.

For this reason in vector control, apart from insecticides, enhancement of the natural immunity acquired by animals in response to tick infestation and vaccination with concealed tick antigens as well as the use of hormones, chemosterilants and genetic manipulation can also be considered.
