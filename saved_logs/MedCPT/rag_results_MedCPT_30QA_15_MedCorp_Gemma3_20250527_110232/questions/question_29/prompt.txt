With your own knowledge and the help of the following document:

Document 1 (Title: Constipation): Examination A physical examination should involve at least an abdominal exam and rectal exam. Abdominal exam may reveal an abdominal mass if there is significant stool burden and may reveal abdominal discomfort. Rectal examination gives an impression of the anal sphincter tone and whether the lower rectum contains any feces or not. Rectal examination also gives information on the consistency of the stool, the presence of hemorrhoids, blood and whether any perineal irregularities are present including skin tags, fissures, anal warts. Physical examination is done manually by a physician and is used to guide which diagnostic tests to order. Diagnostic tests Functional constipation is common and does not warrant diagnostic testing. Imaging and laboratory tests are typically recommended for those with alarm signs or symptoms.
Document 2 (Title: Gynecology_Novak): Anorectal Examination Visual and digital inspection of the vagina and anus will help to identify structural abnormalities such as prolapse, fistulas, fissures, hemorrhoids, or prior trauma. As previously mentioned, a rectovaginal examination provides useful information regarding the integrity of the rectovaginal septum and can demonstrate laxity in the support of the perineal body. The rectovaginal examination is helpful in the diagnosis of enteroceles, which can be felt as protrusion of bowel between the vaginal and rectal fingers with straining. Digital rectal examination should be performed at rest, with squeeze, and while straining. The presence of fecal material in the anal canal may suggest fecal impaction or neuromuscular weakness of the anal continence mechanism. Circumferential protrusion of the upper rectum around the examining finger during straining suggests intussusception, which often occurs in combination with laxity of the posterior rectal support along the sacrum.
Document 3 (Title: Anoscopy -- Introduction): Anoscopy is a bedside procedure that is inexpensive, can be performed quickly without bowel preparation or the need for sedation. With this method, the examiner can visualize the internal portions of the anal sphincter and the distal rectum. Prospective studies suggest that anoscopy has a higher sensitivity for anorectal lesions such as internal hemorrhoids, proctitis, lacerations, fistulas, ulcers, and masses than a flexible sigmoidoscopy. Up to 50% of rectal bleeding can be falsely attributed to hemorrhoids without internal examination to confirm this diagnosis. [1] [2] [3] [4]
Document 4 (Title: Gynecology_Novak): 4. Palpate the anal canal and rectum with a well-lubricated, gloved index finger. Lay the pulp of the index finger against the anal orifice and instruct the subject to strain downward. Concomitant with the patient’s downward straining (which tends to relax the external sphincter muscle), exert upward pressure until the sphincter is felt to yield. Then, with a slight rotary movement, insinuate the finger past the anal canal into the rectum. Examine the anal canal systematically before exploring the rectum. 5. Evaluate the anal canal for: a. Tonus of the external sphincter muscle and the anorectal ring at the anorectal junction b. Tenderness (usually caused by a tight sphincter, anal fissure, or painful hemorrhoids) c. Tumor or irregularities, especially at the pectinate line d. Superior aspect: Reach as far as you can. Mild straining by the patient may cause some lesions, which are out of reach of the finger, to descend sufficiently low to be detected by palpation. e.
Document 5 (Title: Gynecology_Novak): 1. The perianal and perineal regions are common sites for itching. Pruritus ani is usually indicated by thickening, excoriations, and eczema of the perianal region and adjacent areas. 2. The anal opening often is the site of fissures, fistulae, and external hemorrhoids. 3. The pilonidal area may present a dimple, a sinus, or an inﬂamed pilonidal cyst. 2. Instruct the patient to “strain down” and note whether this technique brings into view previously concealed internal hemorrhoids, polyps, or a prolapsed rectal mucosa. 3. Palpate the pilonidal area, the ischiorectal fossa, the perineum, and the perianal region before inserting the gloved finger into the anal canal. Note the presence of any concealed induration or tenderness in any of these areas. 4.
Document 6 (Title: Anal Fissures -- Differential Diagnosis): An anal fissure is a clinical diagnosis made essentially by physical exam alone, which must be done to rule out other possible causes of rectal pain. Hemorrhoids are the most common finding in patients with rectal pain. However, only external hemorrhoids are painful, especially if they are thrombosed. Patients can also have perianal abscesses that cause pain on defecation and can bleed. Perianal abscesses can also form anal fistulas to a deeper site and either bleed or have purulent drainage. Patients with sexually transmitted infections, inflammatory bowel disease, or tuberculosis can form perianal ulcerations. A rare condition known as solitary rectal ulcer syndrome can also be encountered; however, this lesion has no known cause and is usually found by sigmoidoscopy, several centimeters proximal to the anus itself.
Document 7 (Title: [Hemorrhoidal disease and the concomitant changes in the rectosigmoid].): Hemorrhoids is the most common disease in coloproctology, and rectoromanoscopy is a valuable tool of diagnosis. Of a total of 1614 patients examined at the proctologic consulting room of the Department of Gastroenterology at the Medical Academy in Sofia, hemorrhoids had 609 (37.8 per cent). External were 2 per cent of the hemorrhoids, internal 81.1 per cent and external + internal 15.9 per cent. Characteristic finding in internal hemorrhoids were the swelling in the anal canal, localized along 3, 7 and 11 hours of the clock dial in knee-elbow position of the patient. Endoscopic symptoms of hemorrhoid malignization were ulceration, thickening and infiltration of the mucosa at the bottom of the erosion. Hemorrhoids were frequently associated with accompanying diseases (52.6 per cent) which aggravated the patients complaints. They may occasionally be the cause of symptomatic hemorrhoids.
Document 8 (Title: Thrombosed hemorrhoid mimicking rectal carcinoma at CT.): A 46-year-old man with cirrhosis and portal hypertension complained of lower pelvic pain. CT of the rectum raised a strong suspicion of a rectal tumor. However, rectal examination, anoscopy, direct rectoscopy, and, unfortunately, post-mortem dissection, failed to confirm its existence. Nevertheless, large flat hemorrhoids were evident. Review of the patient's chart disclosed the presence of large thrombosed hemorrhoids detected by rectal examination prior to the CT examination. It is suggested that rectal hemorrhoids be included in the differential diagnosis of rectal tumor shown by CT in patients with portal hypertension.
Document 9 (Title: Rectal bleeding): Rectal bleeding refers to bleeding in the rectum. There are many causes of rectal hemorrhage, including inflamed hemorrhoids (which are dilated vessels in the perianal fat pads), rectal varices, proctitis (of various causes), stercal ulcers and infections. Diagnosis is usually made by proctoscopy, which is an endoscopic test. Bleeding from the anus is termed anal hemorrhage and is usually superficial in nature.

Document 10 (Title: The relationship between carcinoma of the rectum and hemorrhoids.): The suspected positive correlation between rectal carcinoma and hemorrhoids was examined in a retrospective study. In patients older than 50 a significant positive correlation could be demonstrated between rectal carcinoma and hemorrhoids. In the group of hemorrhoid patients described it could not be shown that rectal carcinoma was more frequent than in the normal population. In patients older than 40 with hemorrhoids a rectoscopy is always recommended. In this material the colonic enema did not contribute any diagnostic information from which therapeutic consequences could be inferred.
Document 11 (Title: [Hemorrhoids: recognition and current therapeutic possibilities].): Up to 5% of the patients of a general practitioner have terminal bowel disease, most frequently hemorrhoids. Any patient who presents with ano-rectal discomfort or anal blood losses should undergo thorough proctologic examination including rectoscopy. Digital palpation is insufficient as only 10% of rectal carcinomas can be reached. The treatment of hemorrhoids should be started by instructing the patient on anal hygiene, to be followed only then by symptomatic application of creams or suppositories. If these symptomatic measures fail, treatment by injections is indicated. This method may be complicated by localized or extensive necrosis of the rectal mucosa, the cause of which is assumed to be an immunologic event resembling the Arthus phenomenon in which bacterial or possibly pharmacologic substances may act as antigens. Therefore, a method of provoking coagulation without using foreign substances was sought. Thermocoagulation by the infrared coagulator appears to be a suitable method: first experience tends show equal efficacy with coagulation by injection treatment. Prolapsing hemorrhoids are still treated by barron ligation. The precise management of each therapeutic approach is described.
Document 12 (Title: Radiation Therapy for Anal Cancer -- Differential Diagnosis): The differential diagnosis for anal cancer is broad and dependent upon its clinical presentation. Bright red blood per rectum may also be the result of hemorrhoids, polyps, diverticulosis, anal fissures, ulcers, abscess, or proctitis. A sizeable malignant mass at the anus may also originate from the rectum, bladder, prostate, or vagina.
Document 13 (Title: [Solitary ulcer of the rectum. Description of a case].): A case of solitary rectal ulcer is presented. Different views on the pathogenesis are discussed. Symptoms were nonspecific: anal pain, rectal tenesmus and bleeding. On sigmoidoscopy, the lesion has a characteristic appearance, but the definitive diagnosis of benignity must depend upon the recognition of specific histopathologic features in rectal biopsy specimens from ulcer margins. In this case, the surgical treatment was satisfactory, but frequently neither medical nor surgical treatment achieve relief of symptoms or healing of the lesion.
Document 14 (Title: A common pathophysiology for full thickness rectal prolapse, anterior mucosal prolapse and solitary rectal ulcer.): Anorectal pressures at rest, during conscious contraction of the external sphincter, during serial distension of the rectum and during straining to inflate a balloon were measured in 56 patients (21 patients with full thickness rectal prolapse, 24 patients with anterior mucosal prolapse, 11 patients with solitary rectal ulcer) and in 30 normal subjects. Both basal and squeeze pressures were significantly lower in the three groups of patients compared with matched normal controls (P less than 0.05). During increases in intra-abdominal pressure, anal pressure remained above maximum rectal pressure (P less than 0.05) in normal controls, with the highest anal pressures being recorded in the most caudal anal channels. In contrast, anal pressures tended to be lower than rectal pressures during this manoeuvre in patients with rectal prolapse, anterior mucosal prolapse and solitary rectal ulcer, and the highest pressures were recorded in the channels nearest the rectum. During serial distension of the rectum, 64 per cent of patients with solitary rectal ulcer, 75 per cent with anterior mucosal prolapse and 76 per cent with rectal prolapse, but only 10 per cent of controls, showed repetitive rectal contractions. The highest anal pressure always remained higher than rectal pressure during rectal distension in normal subjects (P less than 0.05) but not in patients. The threshold rectal volume required to cause a desire to defaecate and the maximum tolerable volume were significantly lower (P less than 0.05) in each of the patient groups, compared with normal subjects. The similarity in the results from patients with rectal prolapse, anterior mucosal prolapse and solitary rectal ulcer support the hypothesis that they share a common pathophysiology. In each of the groups, the rectum is hypersensitive and hyper-reactive, and weakness of the anal sphincter creates the conditions for prolapse of the rectum to occur into or through the anal canal.
Document 15 (Title: Gynecology_Novak): 6. Follow the bimanual examination with a rectovaginal–abdominal examination. Insert the index finger into the vagina and the middle finger into the rectum very gently. Place the other hand on the infraumbilical region. The use of this technique makes possible higher exploration of the pelvis because the cul-de-sac does not limit the depth of the examining finger. 7. In patients who have an intact hymen, examine the pelvic organs by the rectal–abdominal technique. Table 1.6 (Continued ) E. Rectal examination 1. Inspect the perianal and anal area, the pilonidal (sacrococcygeal) region, and the perineum for the following aspects: a. Color of the region (note that the perianal skin is more pigmented than the surrounding skin of the buttocks and is frequently thrown into radiating folds) b. 1. The perianal and perineal regions are common sites for itching. Pruritus ani is usually indicated by thickening, excoriations, and eczema of the perianal region and adjacent areas. 2.
