Document 1 (Title: Etomidate): Pharmacokinetics At the typical dose, anesthesia is induced for the duration of about 5–10 minutes, though the half-life of drug metabolism is about 75 minutes, because etomidate is redistributed from the plasma to other tissues. Onset of action: 30–60 seconds Peak effect: 1 minute Duration: 3–5 minutes; terminated by redistribution Distribution: Vd: 2–4.5 L/kg Protein binding: 76% Metabolism: Hepatic and plasma esterases Half-life distribution: 2.7 minutes Half-life redistribution: 29 minutes Half-life elimination: 2.9 to 5.3 hours Metabolism Etomidate is highly protein-bound in blood plasma and is metabolised by hepatic and plasma esterases to inactive products. It exhibits a biexponential decline.
Document 2 (Title: [Studies on buffalo milk. XI. Heterogeneity of the buffalo k-casein and the less moving fractions treated with 2-mercaptoethanol (author's transl)].): The heterogeneity of the buffalo k-casein, treated with 2-mercaptoethanol, has been estimated by disk gel-polyacrylamide electrophoresis on 428 caseins isolated from individual milks. The investigation showed six electrophoretic fractions: A, B, C, D, E, F, that, in ten buffalo farms considered formed ten different groups: ABCDEF; ABCDE; ABCEF; ABCE; BCDE; CDEF; BCE; CDE; CEF; and CE. The group ABCDE is the only that is present in all ten farms considered and presents on the whole, the greater number of observations (161). The fraction C is the most abundant. The investigation showed the heterogeneity of the gamma fraction, showing five electrophoretic fractions: A, B, C, D, E, that constitute the nine following groups; ABCDE; ABCD; BCDE; ABD; BCD; ABC; BD; BC and AB. At present a possible correlation to genetic factors seems hazardous.
Document 3 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): These opioids differ mainly in their potency and biodisposition. Sufentanil is five to seven times more potent than fentanyl. Alfentanil is considerably less potent than fentanyl, but acts more rapidly and has a markedly shorter duration of action. Remifentanil is metabolized very rapidly by blood and nonspecific tissue esterases, making its pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic half-lives extremely short. Such properties are useful when these compounds are used in anesthesia practice. Although fentanyl is now the predominant analgesic in the phenylpiperidine class, meperidine continues to be used. This older opioid has significant antimuscarinic effects, which may be a contraindication if tachycardia would be a problem. Meperidine is also reported to have a negative inotropic action on the heart. In addition, it has the potential for producing seizures secondary to accumulation of its metabolite, normeperidine, in patients receiving high doses or with concurrent renal failure. Given
Document 4 (Title: Perioperative Anticoagulation Management -- Pathophysiology -- Direct Inhibitors of Thrombin): Dabigatran is the only medication in this group. Its mechanism of action is the direct inhibition of thrombin, preventing the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin and, thus, clot formation. Dabigatran has a quick onset of action (0.5 to 2 hours) and is metabolized by non-specific plasma esterases. The plasma half-life is around 12 hours; however, the half-life of this drug is tremendously affected by renal function, as its excretion is 80% by the kidneys and less than 10% by the liver. It is recommended to avoid dabigatran use with creatinine clearance (CrCl) less than 30ml/min due to the potential for drug accumulation and adverse effects of bleeding (see Table. Pharmacological Characteristics of Direct Oral Anticoagulation DOACs Drugs).
Document 5 (Title: Pharmacokinetic drug interactions in anaesthetic practice.): Patients receive on average 10 different drugs while in hospital; when fewer than 6 are administered the probability of an adverse drug interaction is about 5%, but when more than 15 are given the probability increases to over 40%. Patients presenting for anaesthesia and surgery are likely to receive multiple preoperative drug therapy and also many perioperative medications as part of their anaesthetic regimen. Thus, there is a considerable potential for interactions to occur in anaesthetic practice. Pharmacokinetic interactions occur when the administration of 1 drug alters the disposition of another, and hence alters the concentration of drug at the receptor site, leading to altered drug response. These changes in drug concentration at the receptor site may be produced by alteration of (a) drug absorption and uptake into the body, (b) drug distribution, (c) drug metabolism and (d) drug elimination or excretion by nonmetabolic routes. Interactions affecting the absorption of orally administered medications are often due to the indirect effect of 1 drug on gastric motility and emptying, which leads to reduced, delayed or variable systemic drug availability. Gastric emptying time before elective surgery is normal, but premedication with morphine, pethidine (meperidine) and anticholinergics all delay gastric emptying and hence drug absorption. Inhalational anaesthesia of short duration does not appear to affect drug absorption, although halothane anaesthetic used for longer periods produces a slight delay in gastric emptying. Volatile anaesthetics have been shown to delay the intramuscular absorption of ketamine. Anaesthetic agents may affect drug distribution, and peak concentrations of propranolol, for example, are 4 times higher during halothane anaesthesia in dogs, accompanied by a marked decrease in volume of distribution. This effect has been noted for other drugs, including thiopental and verapamil. Volatile anaesthetics also affect plasma protein binding, leading to displacement interactions in some cases. Volatile anaesthetics affect the metabolism of concomitantly administered drug (a) by altering the rate of delivery to the organ of clearance (e.g. decreasing hepatic blood flow) and (b) by altering the activity of drug metabolising enzymes. It is now well recognised that all the volatile anaesthetics currently in use inhibit the metabolism of a large variety of drugs, e.g. propranolol, lidocaine (lignocaine), fentanyl and pethidine. Other examples of interactions of clinical importance to anaesthesiologists include those between cimetidine and the local anaesthetics and benzodiazepines; inhibition of plasma cholinesterase by drugs such as ecothiopate; interactions between monoamine oxidase inhibitors and sympathomimetics or pethidine and between monoamine oxidase inhibitors and sympathomimetics or pethidine and between isoniazid and enflurane.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
Document 6 (Title: The relationship of pharmacokinetics to pharmacological activity: morphine, methadone and naloxone.): This review illustrates current approaches to the study of the disposition in man of the strong analagesics morphine and methadone and the narcotic antagonist naloxone. Morphine administered orally is rapidly absorbed but equally rapidly metabolised to morphine glucuronide. This contributes to the diminished oral efficacy of morphine. Following intramuscular administration morphine is very rapidly absorbed. After intravenous injection, the serum levels of morphine during the first 10 minutes are higher and more variable in older patients. The half-life of morphine between 20 minutes and 6 hours is 2 to 3 hours and this value does not appear to be influenced by the age of the patient. Similar half-lives for morphine have been reported to normal volunteers and in anaethetised patients who received morphine. Thus, surgical anaesthesia may not markedly influence morphine half-life and disposition. Based on urinary excretion data in man, accelerated morphine metabolism and excretion do not contribute to morphine tolerance. Methadone is now widely used in the treatment of narcotic abuse. The half-life of methadone averages 25 hours. The prolonged retention of methadone in the plasma may be related to its extensive binding to plasma proteins. With chronic dosing, studies in both animals and man indicate an increase in the metabolism of methadone. Unlike morphine, the urinary excretion of methadone increases with acidification of the urine. Women may metabolise methadone to a greater extent than do men. With the exception of pupillary effects, the plasma levels of methadone correlate poorly with its pharmacological activity. There is a marked variation in methadone plasma levels between patients and within the same patient. Naloxone rapidly disappears from the serum in man and the initial distribution phase has a half-life of 4 minutes. The half-life of naloxone in serum following distribution is 64 minutes. Based on animal studies, the rapid onset of the narcotic antagonist action of naloxone can be related to its rapid entry into the brain, whereas its potency stems in part from its high lipid solubility which allows a high brain concentration to be achieved. The short duration of action of naloxone may result from its rapid egress from the brain.
Document 7 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): 1. Potency—Drugs A and B are said to be more potent than drugs C and D because of the relative positions of their dose-response curves along the dose axis of Figure 2–15. Potency refers to the concentration (EC50) or dose (ED50) of a drug required to produce 50% of that drug’s maximal effect. Thus, the pharmacologic potency of drug A in Figure 2–15 is less than that of drug B, a partial agonist because the EC50 of A is greater than the EC50 of B. Potency of a drug depends in part on the affinity (Kd) of receptors for binding the drug and in part on the efficiency with which drug-receptor interaction is coupled to response. Note that some doses of drug A can produce larger effects than any dose of drug B, despite the fact that we describe drug B as pharmacologically more potent. The reason for this is that drug A has a larger maximal efficacy (as described below).
Document 8 (Title: End-of-Life Evaluation and Management of Pain -- Treatment / Management -- Pharmacological Management of Pain): The selection of an opiate agent should take into account the individual needs of the patient. The mechanically ventilated patient can get fentanyl or hydromorphone due to the fast action and easy titration. Patients with renal and hepatic insufficiency should get IV Fentanyl with doses adjusted. Remifentanil can also be used because its metabolism is not dependent on hepatic or renal function. It is metabolized by nonspecific plasma esterases located primarily within erythrocytes. Patients who require frequent neurological checks can also benefit from remifentanil due to its ultra-short duration of action. Patients with hemodynamic instability or bronchospasm should not receive morphine sulfate as it causes histamine release. Meperidine should be avoided in patients with renal and hepatic failure because of severe neurotoxicity from the accumulation of an active metabolite. Codeine is another medication with limited use at the end of life with a high incidence of constipation. Approximately 10% of the population lacks the enzyme necessary to convert codeine (a prodrug) to morphine, leading to insufficient analgesia. [20]
Document 9 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): Alosetron is a highly potent and selective antagonist of the 5-HT3 receptor. It is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract with a bioavailability of 50–60% and has a plasma half-life of 1.5 hours but a much longer duration of effect. It undergoes extensive hepatic cytochrome P450 metabolism with renal excretion of most metabolites. Alosetron binds with higher affinity and dissociates more slowly from 5-HT3 receptors than other 5-HT3 antagonists, which may account for its long duration of action. Alosetron is approved for the treatment of women with severe IBS in whom diarrhea is the predominant symptom FIGURE 62–5 Chemical structure of serotonin; the 5-HT3 antagonists ondansetron, granisetron, dolasetron, and alosetron; and the 5-HT4 partial agonist tegaserod.
Document 10 (Title: Posttraumatic Stress Disorder -- Evaluation -- Criterion F: Duration): Persistence of symptoms in Criterion B, C, D, and E for more than 1 month Criterion G: The disturbance causes significant functional impairment or distress in various areas of life, such as social or occupational. Criterion H: The disturbance is not attributable to substance use, medication, or another medical illness. [47]
Document 11 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): The kidney appears to play an important role in its metabolism and excretion. Somatostatin has limited therapeutic usefulness because of its short duration of action and multiple effects in many secretory systems. A series of longer-acting somatostatin analogs that retain biologic activity have been developed. Octreotide, the most widely used somatostatin analog (Figure 37–2), is 45 times more potent than somatostatin in inhibiting GH release but only twice as potent in reducing insulin secretion. Because of this relatively reduced effect on pancreatic beta cells, hyperglycemia rarely occurs during treatment. The plasma elimination half-life of octreotide is about 80 minutes, 30 times longer than that of somatostatin.
Document 12 (Title: Posttraumatic Stress Disorder in Children -- Evaluation -- Criterion E: Duration): Persistence of symptoms in Criterion A, B, C, and D for more than 1 month. Criterion F: The disturbance causes significant functional impairment or distress in various areas of life, such as social or educational. Criterion G: The disturbance is not attributable to substance use, medication, or another medical illness. [53]
Document 13 (Title: Migraine Medications -- Introduction): Headache (migraine-like or tension-type-like) on greater than or equal to 15 days/month for greater than three months and also fulfilling criteria B and C Occurring in a patient who has experienced at least five attacks fulfilling criteria B through D for migraine presenting without aura and/or criteria B and C for migraine that presents with aura Occurs greater than or equal to 8 days/month for greater than three months, fulfilling any of the following Criteria C and D for migraine without aura Criteria B and C for migraine with aura Believed by the patient to be migraine at the point of onset and relieved by a triptan or ergot derivative Not better accounted for with another ICHD-3 diagnosis
Document 14 (Title: Alpha-1 blocker): Elimination: Elimination half-life for alfuzosin is around 8 hours, alfuzosin is metabolised mainly via liver. 75–91% is excreted in feces and 35% in unchanged form. Distribution volume and excretion increases with renal impairment due to less protein binding, but the half-life elimination rate is unchanged. therefore no dose adjustment is needed for low to moderate renal impairment. Delay in elimination half-life, peak concentration in plasma is double and bioavailability is changed in hepatic impairment patients. Alfuzosin should not be used for patients with renal impairment. Tamsulosin is excreted via urine and 9% of that is unchanged on its active form, elimination half-life for tamsulosin is between 9–13 hours for healthy volunteers. The elimination half-life for target patients is around 14–15 hours. No dose adjustment is needed for patients with renal impairment and moderate hepatic impairment. 10–20% of terazosin is excreted unchanged in urine and feces during oral
Document 15 (Title: Moclobemide): In humans moclobemide is rapidly and almost completely absorbed and totally metabolised via the liver. Peak plasma levels occur 0.3 to 2 hours after oral administration. The bioavailability increases during the first week of therapy from 60% to 80% and more. The elimination half-life is around 2 hours. It is moderately bound to plasma proteins, especially albumin. However, the short disposition half life somewhat increases after repeated dosing; moclobemide has an intermediate elimination half life for systemic clearance and an intermediate volume of distribution. Despite its short half-life the pharmacodynamic action of a single dose persists for approximately 16 hours. The drug is almost completely metabolized in the liver; it is a substrate of CYP2C19 and an inhibitor of CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP1A2. Less than 1 percent of the drug is excreted unchanged; 92 percent of the metabolised drug is excreted within the first 12 hours. The main metabolites are the N-oxide Ro 12-5637 formed
