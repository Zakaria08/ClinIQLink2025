Document 1 (Title: Intraabominal Abscesses -- Treatment / Management): The approach to abscess treatment varies by anatomic location. While a subdiaphragmatic abscess can be drained percutaneously, a pelvic abscess is accessed transrectally or transvaginally. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided drainage provides a safe and effective minimally invasive treatment option. [69] [70] Transesophageal and transgastric approaches have been used for a subphrenic abscess. [71] Splenic abscesses have been traditionally treated with splenectomy, but percutaneous drainage has been correlated with lower mortality and complication rates. [72] Results from a study showed that abscess size, age, inflammatory markers, leukocytosis, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were predictive of the need for surgical intervention due to failure of pharmacologic treatment. [73]

Document 3 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): catalyz-ing events for NOTES were the demonstration that a porcine gallbladder could be removed with a flexible endoscope passed through the wall of the stomach and then removed through the mouth and the demonstration in a series of 10 human cases from India of the ability to perform transgastric appendectomy. Since that time, a great deal of money has been invested by endo-scopic and MIS companies to help surgeons and gastroenterolo-gists explore this new territory. Systemic inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-6 have been shown to be similar in transgastric and transcolonic NOTES when compared to laparoscopy in por-cine models.83 Concerns about the safety of transluminal access and limitations in equipment remain the greatest barriers to expansion. To date, the most headline-grabbing procedures have been the transvaginal and transgastric removal of the gallbladder84-86 (Fig. 14-25). To ensure safety, all human cases
Document 4 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): and laparoscopic techniques.69 There are a limited number of randomized trials reporting the use of these new techniques. An important concept common to all of these approaches, however, is the attempt to delay surgical interven-tion, since a number of trials have identified increased mortality when intervention occurs during the first 2 weeks of illness.Data supporting the use of endoscopic approaches to infected pancreatic necrosis include nearly a dozen case series and a randomized trial.70,71 The reported mortality rate was 5%, with a 30% complication rate. Most authors noted the common requirement for multiple endoscopic debridements (similar to the open approach), with a median of four sessions required. Fewer series report experience with the laparoscopic approach, either transgastric or transperitoneal, entering the necrosis through the transverse mesocolon or gastrocolic ligament. Lap-aroscopic intervention is limited by the difficulty in achieving Figure
Document 5 (Title: Ligation procedures in the management of portal hypertension.): In the 10 year period from 1964 through 1973, 25 patients bleeding from esophageal varices underwent ligation procedures coupled with splenectomy rather than a shunt. These procedures included the transesophageal and transgastric approaches and extragastric ligations. For patients with normal liver function, the risk of this urgent or emergency surgery is comparatively low (two of 12 patients died). The chance of recurrent hemorrhage is high (nine of nine surviving patients), as is the need for subsequent surgery (eight of nine patients). Nevertheless, despite these drawbacks, nine of these 12 patients (75 percent) are alive, and seven have survived 5 or more years. In patients with cirrhosis, the initial operative mortality rate (three of 12 patients) and the subsequent mortality rate (five additional patients) reflect the greater risk because of liver disease. Only five of 13 patients (38 percent) survive, three of whom are alive 5 or more years. In patients with cirrhosis, the initial operative mortality rate (three of 12 patients) and the subsequent mortality rate (five additional patients) reflect the greater risk because of liver disease. Only five of 13 patients (38 percent) survive, three of whom are alive 5 or more years after their initial surgery. These results indicate that there are situations when ligation procedures are valuable, especially in the noncirrhotic patient.
