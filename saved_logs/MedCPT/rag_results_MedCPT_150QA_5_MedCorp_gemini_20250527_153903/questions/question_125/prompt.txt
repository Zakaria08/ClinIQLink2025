Document 1 (Title: Adverse effects of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in a child with dihydropteridine reductase deficiency.): A child with dihydropteridine reductase (DHPR) deficiency developed signs of dopamine insufficiency after being given trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX). She recovered function after the antibiotic was stopped, which suggests that it adversely influenced dopamine metabolism in the CNS. The authors speculate that TMP, a dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor, was the major cause of the patient's deterioration, and suggest that it and other dihydrofolate inhibitors, notably methotrexate, are contra-indicated for patients with DHPR deficiency.
Document 2 (Title: First_Aid_Step1): Trimethoprim, mecHaNism Similar to sulfonamides, but structurally distinct Purines Thymidine Methionine agent. cliNical Use Leprosy (lepromatous and tuberculoid), DNA, RNA DNA Protein Pneumocystis jirovecii prophylaxis, or treatment when used in combination with TMP. aDVerse eFFects Hemolysis if G6PD deficient, methemoglobinemia, agranulocytosis. mecHaNism Inhibits bacterial dihydrofolate reductase. Bacteriostatic. cliNical Use Used in combination with sulfonamides (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole [TMPSMX]), causing sequential block of folate synthesis. Combination used for UTIs, Shigella, Salmonella, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia treatment and prophylaxis, toxoplasmosis prophylaxis. aDVerse eFFects Hyperkalemia (high doses), megaloblastic anemia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, which may be avoided with coadministration of leucovorin (folinic acid). TMP Treats Marrow Poorly.
Document 3 (Title: Folinic acid): Additionally, folinic acid is sometimes used to reduce the side effects of methotrexate in rheumatoid arthritis patients. This includes reductions in nausea, abdominal pain, abnormal liver blood tests, and mouth sores. Folinic acid is also used in combination with the chemotherapy agent 5-fluorouracil in treating colon cancer. In this case, folinic acid is not used for "rescue" purposes; rather, it enhances the effect of 5-fluorouracil by inhibiting thymidylate synthase. Folinic acid is also sometimes used to prevent toxic effects of high doses of antimicrobial dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors such as trimethoprim and pyrimethamine. It may be prescribed in the treatment of toxoplasmosis retinitis, in combination with the folic acid antagonists pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine. Folinic acid is also used in the treatment of cerebral folate deficiency, a syndrome in which the use of folic acid cannot normalize cerebrospinal fluid levels of 5-MTHF.
Document 4 (Title: Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole): Contraindications Contraindications include the following: Known hypersensitivity to trimethoprim, sulphonamides or any other ingredients in the formulations Pregnancy – especially in the period prior to birth Severe hepatic failure, marked liver parenchymal damage or jaundice. Serious haematological disorders and porphyria (due to the sulfonamide component of the preparation). Severe chronic kidney disease (CrCl <15 ml/min) where repeated measurements of the plasma concentration cannot be performed Co-trimoxazole should not be given to neonates during the first 6 weeks, except for the treatment/prophylaxis of Pneumocystis jirovecii (P. carinii) in infants of four weeks of age or greater. Interactions Its use is advised against in people being concomitantly treated with:
Document 5 (Title: HIV and AIDS -- Treatment / Management -- Recommended Therapy for Prophylaxis of Opportunistic Infections): For the treatment of P jirovecii , weight-based dosing of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (co-trimoxazole) for 21 days is recommended in addition to high-dose steroids to manage the progressive respiratory complications of acute pneumonia and reduce mortality risk. Alternatives include primaquine with clindamycin and intravenous pentamidine for 21 days. Primary prophylaxis of toxoplasmosis, where the risk is greatest with a CD4+ count <100 cells/mm 3 , is also covered by low trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (co-trimoxazole). Alternatives in the event of a non-severe allergy to sulfur include dapsone with pyrimethamine and calcium folinate. Discontinuation of primary prophylaxis may be considered if the CD4+ count is >200 cells/mm 3 for 3 or more months in individuals on antiretroviral therapy. [54] [55] [56] [57] Vaccinations should be encouraged for patients with HIV, as these may reduce the risk of mortality from influenza, pneumococcal, and meningococcal pneumonia and reduce the risk of other blood-borne viral infections. [58] [59] [60] [61] Given the higher risk of human papillomavirus–related cancers in patients with HIV, human papillomavirus vaccination is recommended.
