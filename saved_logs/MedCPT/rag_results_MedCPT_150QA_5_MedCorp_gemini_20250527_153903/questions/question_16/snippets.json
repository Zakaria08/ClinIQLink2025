        "content": "A successful surgical case of concomitant aorto-coronary bypass grafting and aorto-right iliac, left femoral bypass grafting was presented. A sixty-two years old male admitted to our institution with complaints of angina pectoris and intermittent claudication of both legs who had a history of acute inferior myocardial infarction for which emergency percutaneous coronary balloon dilatation was carried out prior to this admission. In this admission, he was found out to have diabetes mellitus moreover and he hoped to have one staged operation for two different type of the disease. After general anesthesia, at first, aorto-right coronary bypass grafting with saphenous vein graft was carried out under cardio-pulmonary bypass, then aorto-right iliac, left femoral bypass grafting with a dacron bifurcated graft was made only with one time of systemic heparinization. His postoperative course was uneventful and discharged in good condition. We conclude that simultaneous aorto-coronary bypass and revascularization of both legs can be done with minimal risk.",

        "content": "Signs and symptoms The signs and symptoms of peripheral artery disease are based on the part of the body that is affected. About 66% of patients affected by PAD either do not have symptoms or have atypical symptoms. The most common presenting symptom is intermittent claudication, which causes pain and severe cramping when walking or exercising. The pain is usually located in the calf muscles of the affected leg and relieved by rest. This occurs because during exercise the muscles of the leg need more oxygen. Normally, the arteries would be able to increase the amount of blood flow and therefore increase the amount of oxygen going to the exercised leg. However, in PAD, the artery is unable to respond appropriately to the increased demand for oxygen by the muscles, as a result, the leg muscles are overly saturated with lactic acid, resulting in pain of the muscle that only goes away with rest. Other symptoms may include",

He has a history of hyper-tension and coronary artery disease with symptoms of stable angina. He can walk only half a block before pain in his legs forces him to stop. He has a 50-pack-year smoking history but stopped 2 years ago. Medications include atenolol, atorvastatin, and hydrochlorothiazide. The nurse in the preoperative holding area obtains the following vital signs: temperature 36.8\u00b0C (98.2\u00b0F), blood pressure 168/100 mm Hg, heart rate 78 bpm, oxygen saturation by pulse oximeter 96% while breathing room air, and pain 5/10 in the right lower leg after walking into the hospital. What anesthetic agents will you choose for his anesthetic plan? Why? Does the choice of anesthetic make a difference?",
