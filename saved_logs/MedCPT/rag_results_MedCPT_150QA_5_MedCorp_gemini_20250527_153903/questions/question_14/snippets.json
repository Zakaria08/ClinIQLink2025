        "title": "Auditory Brainstem Response -- Introduction",
        "content": "Auditory brainstem response (ABR), or brainstem auditory Evoked Potentials (BAEP), is an objective measurement of auditory pathway function from the auditory nerve to the mesencephalon. ABR tests synchronous neural function and can estimate hearing sensitivity thresholds in individuals unable to tolerate traditional behavioral audiometry. [1] Electrical activity from the eighth cranial nerve and neurons along the brainstem auditory pathway are recorded by surface electrodes placed on the scalp, forehead, and near the ears for 10 milliseconds after an acoustic stimulus. [2] The readings consist of up to 7 positive wave peaks labeled I-VII with negative troughs in between. It was first introduced into audiology in the 1970s, and its importance has increased with the contemporary guidelines of newborn hearing screening for hearing loss within 3 months of age. [3] It is now essential in diagnosing hearing loss, acoustic tumors, and cerebellopontine angle tumors. [4]",

        "content": "Brain stroke Brain stroke in a region affecting auditory function such as a posterior circulation infarct has been associated with deafness. Pathophysiology Sensory hearing loss is caused by abnormal structure or function of the hair cells of the organ of Corti in the cochlea. Neural hearing impairments are consequent upon damage to the eighth cranial nerve (the vestibulocochlear nerve) or the auditory tracts of the brainstem. If higher levels of the auditory tract are affected this is known as central deafness. Central deafness may present as sensorineural deafness but should be distinguishable from the history and audiological testing. Cochlear dead regions in sensory hearing loss",

        "content": "A 40-year-old male presented with a 2-month history of sudden hearing loss and tinnitus in his left ear. Mild vertigo was present initially but disappeared spontaneously without treatment. Facial nerve paralysis and retroauricular pain appeared 3 months after the onset of hearing loss on the same side. Computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a 1-cm mass in the left internal auditory canal. Translabyrinthine removal of tumor revealed metastatic adenocarcinoma. The patient died 3 months postoperatively from multiple metastatic deposits. A primary tumor was never found. The course of illness in this patient differs significantly from the typical course of other conditions involving the internal auditory canal. A metastatic work-up should be considered for patients with a similar history before a craniotomy is performed.",

        "content": "Facial nerve neurinomas are relatively rare and most of them appear at the vertical portion of the facial nerve. Facial nerve neurinoma originated from the cerebellopontine (c-p) angle portion is less frequently reported. A 51-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital complaining of severe headache and nausea. She had had dizziness and unsteady gait for the previous two weeks. She did not complain of hearing disturbance, but otological examination revealed sensorineural deafness. She had no facial palsy. Skull x-ray showed no erosion of the internal auditory canal. Plain CT-scan revealed a large, unenhanced, low-density mass in the right c-p angle cistern. At the time of the operation, this tumor originated from the right facial nerve. Histological diagnosis of this tumor was schwannoma. After the operation, right facial nerve palsy appeared but hardness of hearing was no worse than previously. This tumor seemed to be facial nerve neurinoma in the c-p angle cistern. To the present, 121 facial nerve neurinomas have been reported in the previous literature. Facial nerve neurinomas in the c-p angle cistern, however, have only been reported in 5 cases. The most frequent symptom of facial nerve neurinoma in the temporal bone is facial nerve palsy, but that of facial nerve neurinoma in the c-p angle cistern is hearing loss, as in an acoustic neurinoma. Preoperative diagnosis of facial neurinoma in the c-p angle cistern using neurological symptoms alone is difficult. Furthermore, differential diagnosis from acoustic neurinoma in the c-p angle cistern using only skull x-rays and CT-scanning is also difficult.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
