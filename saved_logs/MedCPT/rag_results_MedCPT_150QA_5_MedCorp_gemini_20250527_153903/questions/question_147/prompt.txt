With your own knowledge and the help of the following document:

Document 1 (Title: Hepatitis A Vaccine -- Indications): The causative agent for hepatitis A is a positive-strand RNA virus belonging to the hepatovirus genus. This class of virus primarily affects the liver and causes inflammation. Hepatitis A is transmitted mainly via the fecal-oral route or through close physical contact. Transmission from fecal material can happen by directly touching feces or consuming food and water contaminated with fecal matter. [1]
Document 2 (Title: Hepatitis): Hepatitis D The hepatitis D virus requires that a person first be infected with hepatitis B virus, so prevention efforts should focus on limiting the spread of hepatitis B. In people who have chronic hepatitis B infection and are at risk for superinfection with the hepatitis D virus, the preventive strategies are the same as for hepatitis B. Hepatitis E Hepatitis E is spread primarily through the oral-fecal route but may also be spread by blood and from mother to fetus. The mainstay of hepatitis E prevention is similar to that for hepatitis A (namely, good hygiene and clean water practices). Alcoholic hepatitis As excessive alcohol consumption can lead to hepatitis and cirrhosis, the following are maximal recommendations for alcohol consumption: Women – ≤ 3 drinks on any given day and ≤ 7 drinks per week Men – ≤ 4 drinks on any given day and ≤ 14 drinks per week Successes Hepatitis A
Document 3 (Title: Development of vaccines against hepatitis A and hepatitis B.): Hepatitis A and hepatitis B are viral infections of the liver. Hepatitis A is spread by the fecal-oral route--i.e., by ingestion of virus shed in the stool of acutely infected individuals. The virus is transmitted from person to person or (in outbreaks) via contaminated food or water. Population groups at increased risk of acquiring hepatitis A include children and staff in day care centers. Hepatitis B is spread by blood and other body fluids from acutely infected individuals or chronically infected carriers. Infection occurs when virus contained in these fluids enters the body through mucosal surfaces or breaks in the skin. A vaccine against hepatitis B has been developed. It consists of noninfectious hepatitis B surface antigen purified from the plasma of chronic carriers. The three sequential inactivation treatments used in manufacture of the vaccine kill hepatitis B virus and other infectious agents that may be present in human plasma, including the human T cell-lymphotropic virus that causes the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. The vaccine is well tolerated, highly immunogenic, and highly effective in preventing hepatitis B. Both live attenuated and killed vaccines against hepatitis A are also being investigated. A live attenuated vaccine is preferred and seems feasible on the basis of initial studies in animals and volunteers.
Document 4 (Title: Pathology_Robbins): Fig. 16.8 ). Fecal shedding of the virus ends as the IgM titer rises. The IgM response usually declines in a few months followed by the appearance of IgG anti-HAV that persists for years, often conferring lifelong immunity. However, there are no routinely available tests for IgG anti-HAV; the presence of IgG anti-HAV is inferred from the difference between total and IgM anti-HAV. The HAV vaccine, available since 1992, is effective in preventing infection. The outcome of HBV infection varies widely, from (1) acute hepatitis with recovery and clearance of the virus; (2) nonprogressive chronic hepatitis; (3) progressive chronic disease ending in cirrhosis; (4) fulminant hepatitis with massive liver necrosis; and (5) an asymptomatic http://ebooksmedicine.net “healthy” carrier state. HBV-induced chronic liver disease is also an important precursor for the development of HCC. The approximate frequencies of various clinical outcomes of HBV infection are depicted in Fig. 16.9
Document 5 (Title: [Viral hepatitis as a traveler's disease].): At the present time, at least five different forms of viral hepatitis can be distinguished. The hepatitis A and E viruses are transmitted via a fecal-oral route, and are associated with poor hygiene. Hepatitis E is restricted to Central Africa, parts of Asia, and Central America. Hepatitis B, C and D are transmitted not via the fecal-oral route but, in the case of B and D mainly by sexual intercourse, and in the case of hepatitis C by infected blood products. Even after the introduction of interferon alpha, treatment possibilities are limited. Immune prophylaxis (hepatitis A and B) and general preventive measures are of considerable importance, not merely with respect to travelling.
