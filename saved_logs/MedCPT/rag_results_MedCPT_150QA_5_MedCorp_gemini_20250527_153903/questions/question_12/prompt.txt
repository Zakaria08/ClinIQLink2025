Document 1 (Title: [A case of hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy of neuronal type with retardation of motor development].): An atypical case of hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy of neuronal type with retardation of motor development was described. The patient was a 15-year-old boy who had suffered from distal muscle weakness with atrophy of four limbs and deformities of hands and feet since age 6 months. These symptoms were slowly progressive. He had never walked. His parents were not consanguinous. His parents and two siblings were unremarkable on neurological examination and on nerve conduction studies. On neurological examination, he showed severe degree of muscle weakness and atrophy in the distal upper and lower limbs, moderate degree of muscle weakness and atrophy in the proximal upper limbs and slight degree of made weakness and atrophy in the proximal upper limbs. Deep tendon reflexes in four limbs were decreased or absent. Vibration sensation was moderately decreased in the distal parts of four limbs. On the nerve conduction studies, no sensory nerve potential was recorded in the median, ulnar and sural nerves bilaterally. Motor nerve conduction velocity of the right tibial nerve was 21 m/sec and the amplitude of the compound muscle action potential (M-wave) was 0.15 mV, and no M-wave was elicited with the electrical stimulation of the median, ulnar and peroneal nerves. Neelde EMG showed fibrillation potentials and giant spikes with a reduction of the number of motor units. On sural nerve biopsy, the densities of both myelinated and unmyelinated fibers were severely decreased.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Document 2 (Title: Case Study: 32-Year-Old Male Presenting with Right Lower Quadrant Abdominal Pain (Archived) -- Case Presentation): He describes the pain as coming on suddenly and sharp in nature.   Since the onset, his pain started to improve until the morning of his presentation to the emergency department, when it acutely worsened. He says that the pain is much worse with movement.
Document 3 (Title: Neuromuscular junction): Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) is an autoimmune disorder that affects the presynaptic portion of the neuromuscular junction. This rare disease can be marked by a unique triad of symptoms: proximal muscle weakness, autonomic dysfunction, and areflexia. Proximal muscle weakness is a product of pathogenic autoantibodies directed against P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channels, which in turn leads to a reduction of acetylcholine release from motor nerve terminals on the presynaptic cell. Examples of autonomic dysfunction caused by LEMS include erectile dysfunction in men, constipation, and, most commonly, dry mouth. Less common dysfunctions include dry eyes and altered perspiration. Areflexia is a condition in which tendon reflexes are reduced and it may subside temporarily after a period of exercise.
Document 4 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): LEMS is a presynaptic disorder of the neuromuscular junction that can cause weakness similar to that of MG. The proximal muscles of the lower limbs are most commonly affected, but other muscles may be involved as well. Cranial nerve findings, including ptosis of the eyelids and diplopia, occur in up to 70% of patients and resemble features of MG. However, the two conditions are usually readily distinguished, because patients with LEMS have depressed or absent reflexes and experience autonomic changes such as dry mouth and impotence. Nerve stimulation produces an initial low-amplitude response and, at low rates of repetitive stimulation (2–3 Hz), decremental responses like those of MG; however, at high rates (50 Hz), or following exercise, incremental responses occur. LEMS is caused by autoantibodies directed against P/Q-type calcium channels at the motor nerve terminals, which can be detected in ~85% of LEMS patients by radioimmunoassay. These autoantibodies result in impaired release
Document 5 (Title: Neurology_Adams): From the patient and the family it is learned that the patient has been “feeling unwell,” “low in spirits,” “blue,” “down,” “unhappy,” or “morbid.” There has been a change in his emotional reactions of which the patient may not be fully aware. Activities that were formerly found pleasurable are no longer so. Often, however, change in mood is less conspicuous than reduction in psychic and physical energy, and it is in this type of patient that diagnosis is most difficult. A complaint of fatigue is almost invariable; not uncommonly, it is worse in the morning after a night of restless sleep. The patient complains of a “loss of energy,” “weakness,” “tiredness,” “having no energy,” that his job has become more difficult. His outlook is pessimistic. The patient is irritable and preoccupied with uncontrollable worry over trivialities. With excessive worry, the ability to think with accustomed efficiency is reduced; the patient complains that his mind is not functioning properly, and he is

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
Question: A 1-year-old boy presents to the emergency department with weakness and a change in his behavior. His parents state that they first noticed the change in his behavior this morning and it has been getting worse. They noticed the patient was initially weak in his upper body and arms, but now he won’t move his legs with as much strength or vigor as he used to. Physical exam is notable for bilateral ptosis with a sluggish pupillary response, a very weak sucking and gag reflex, and shallow respirations. The patient is currently drooling and his diaper is dry. The parents state he has not had a bowel movement in over 1 day. Which of the following is the pathophysiology of this patient’s condition?
Options:
A. Autoantibodies against the presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels
B. Autoimmune demyelination of peripheral nerves
C. Blockade of presynaptic acetylcholine release at the neuromuscular junction
D. Lower motor neuron destruction in the anterior horn
