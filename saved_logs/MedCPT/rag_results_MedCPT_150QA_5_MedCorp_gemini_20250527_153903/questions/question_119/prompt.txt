Document 1 (Title: Studies on the derivatives of 2-amino-4-p-chlorophenylthiazole-5-acetic acid. I. Syntheses and pharmacological analysis of acylderivatives of 2-amino-4-p-chlorophenylthiazole-5-acetic acid.): A number of new acyl and imidoderivatives of 2-amino-4-p-chlorophenylthiazole-5-acetic acid (II) and its methyl ester (VII) were synthesized. Methyl ester VII heated in benzene solution with acid anhydrides was transformed into adequate acyl derivatives (VIII, IX, X, XIII, XVI). Some of them (X, XIII, XVII) by heating with acetic anhydride underwent cyclization and were transformed into the imido derivatives (XI, XIV, XVIII). Compounds XI, XIV and XVI heated with diluted aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide underwent selective hydrolysis giving the respective dicarboxylic acids XII, XV, XVII. Pharmacological analysis revealed that some of the synthesized preparations exert an anti-inflammatory effect and allow to draw limited relations between chemical structure and pharmacological activity in this group of compounds.

Eur. 3, Appendix 2001 also for iodine and cerium(IV) sulfate solutions, since Ph. Eur. 4, 2002 standardised by sodium thiosulfate) Benzoic acid for standardisation of waterless basic solutions: ethanolic sodium and potassium hydroxide, TBAH, and alkali methanolates in methanol, isopropanol, or DMF Potassium bromate (KBrO3) for standardisation of sodium thiosulfate solutions Potassium hydrogen phthalate (usually called KHP) for standardisation of aqueous base and perchloric acid in acetic acid solutions Sodium carbonate for standardisation of aqueous acids: hydrochloric, sulfuric acid and nitric acid solutions (but not acetic acid) Sodium chloride for standardisation of silver nitrate solutions Sulfanilic acid for standardisation of sodium nitrite solutions Zinc powder, after being dissolved in sulfuric or hydrochloric acid, for standardization of EDTA solutions
Document 3 (Title: Crystalloid Fluids -- Indications -- FDA-Approved Indications): Some commercially available crystalloid fluids and their indications include: 0.9% NaCl (normal saline): parenteral replenishment of fluid and sodium chloride as required by the patient's clinical condition. 0.45% NaCl (hypotonic solution; "half-normal saline"): parenteral replenishment of fluid and sodium chloride as required by the patient's clinical condition. Lactated Ringer/Hartman solution (lactate buffered solution): This solution is indicated as a source of water and electrolytes and serves as an alkalinizing agent. Acetate buffered solution: Indicated as a source of sodium to be added to large-volume intravenous fluids for the prevention or correction of hyponatremia in patients with restricted or no oral intake. These fluids also serve as an additive for preparing specific intravenous fluid formulas when the patient's needs cannot be met using standard electrolyte or nutrient solutions.
Document 4 (Title: Cell_Biology_Alberts): Because an OH– ion combines with a H3O+ ion to form two water molecules, an increase in the OH– concentration forces a decrease in the concentration of H3O+, and vice versa. A pure solution of water contains an equal concentration (10–7 M) of both ions, rendering it neutral. The interior of a cell is also kept close to neutrality by the presence of buffers: weak acids and bases that can release or take up protons near pH 7, keeping the environment of the cell relatively constant under a variety of conditions. Figure 2–5 Protons readily move in aqueous solutions. (a) The reaction that takes place when a molecule of acetic acid dissolves in water. at ph 7, nearly all of the acetic acid is present as acetate ion. (B) Water molecules are continuously exchanging protons with each other to form hydronium and hydroxyl ions. These ions in turn rapidly recombine to form water molecules. a Cell is formed from Carbon Compounds
Document 5 (Title: Biochemistry_Lippinco): B. Buffers A buffer is a solution that resists change in pH following the addition of an acid or base. A buffer can be created by mixing a weak acid (HA) with its conjugate base (A−). If an acid such as HCl is added to a buffer, A− can neutralize it, being converted to HA in the process. If a base is added, HA can likewise neutralize it, being converted to A− in the process. Maximum buffering capacity occurs at a pH equal to the pKa, but a conjugate acid-base pair can still serve as an effective buffer when the pH of a solution is within approximately ±1 pH unit of the pKa. If the amounts of HA and A− are equal, the pH is equal to the pKa. As shown in Figure 1.9, a solution containing acetic acid (HA = CH3 – COOH) and acetate (A− = CH3 – COO−) with a pKa of 4.8 resists a change in pH from pH 3.8 to 5.8, with maximum buffering at pH 4.8. At pH values less than the pKa, the protonated acid form (CH3 – COOH) is the predominant species in solution.
