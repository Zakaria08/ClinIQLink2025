Document 1 (Title: Propofol -- Mechanism of Action): Like most general anesthetic agents, the mechanism of action for propofol is poorly understood but thought to be related to the effects on GABA-mediated chloride channels in the brain. Propofol may work by decreasing the dissociation of GABA from GABA receptors in the brain and potentiating the inhibitory effects of the neurotransmitter. This, in turn, keeps the channel activated for a longer duration, resulting in an increase in chloride conductance across the neuron, causing a hyper-polarization of the cell membrane, making it harder for a successful action potential to fire.

Document 2 (Title: Photostimulation): Optogenetics has shown significant promise in the treatment of a series of neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease and epilepsy. Optogenetics has the potential to facilitate the manipulation and targeting of specific cell types or neural circuits, characteristics that are lacking in current brain stimulation techniques like DBS. At this point, the use of optogenetics in treating neural diseases has only been practically implemented in the field of neurobiology to reveal more about the mechanisms of specific disorders. Before the technique can be implemented to directly treat these disorders developments in other related fields such as gene therapy, opsin engineering, and optoelectronics must also make certain developments.

Document 3 (Title: Cell_Biology_Alberts): A gene encoding channelrhodopsin was introduced into a subpopulation of neurons in the hypothalamus of a mouse. When the neurons were exposed to flashing blue light using a tiny, implanted fiber optic cable, the channelrhodopsin channels opened, depolarizing and activating the cells. When the light was switched on, the mouse immediately became aggressive and attacked the inflated rubber glove; when the light was switched off, its behavior immediately returned to normal (Movie 11.11).

It is therefore now possible to transiently activate or inhibit specific neurons in the brains of awake animals with remarkable spatial and temporal precision. In this way, the rapidly expanding new field of optogenetics is revolutionizing neurobiology, allowing neuroscientists to analyze the neurons and circuits underlying even the most complex behaviors in experimental animals,
Document 4 (Title: Microdialysis studies of brain norepinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine release during ingestive behavior. Theoretical and clinical implications.): This minireview deals with the possible roles of monoamines in feeding and feeding disorders. The introduction sketches the results of earlier studies with local drug injections and selective neurotoxins which provided pharmacological evidence that monoamines can influence food intake and body weight. A table summarizing this evidence is used to list monoamine changes that could underlie anorexia or hyperphagia. It is apparent that abnormalities in the monoamines, along with their cotransmitters, could cause many forms of feeding disorder. It is proposed as a working hypothesis that several varieties of hyperphagia leading to obesity have a common element. This common factor is a change in excitability of a lateral hypothalamic reinforcement system as manifested in self-stimulation at a stimulation-bound feeding site. Understanding this feeding reward-aversion system helps us understand hyperphagia and anorexia. The neurochemistry of reward and aversion involves the monoamines. This paper focuses on dopamine and serotonin. The data support the hypothesis that dopamine systems projecting to the nucleus accumbens and other forebrain areas from the mid-brain ventral tegmental area (VTA) are important for approach and positive reinforcement in ingestive behavior and self-stimulation. Serotonin is hypothesized to facilitate satiety and inhibition of feeding reward in the hypothalamus. The next section abstracts our recent experiments that measured pharmacological and physiological release of the monoamines in the hypothalamus and nucleus accumbens during ingestive behavior and self-stimulation. In vivo microdialysis in freely moving rats suggested the following: (1) Norepinephrine was released in the paraventricular nucleus during the active, feeding period of the circadian cycle. (2) The serotonin metabolite 5-HIAA also increased in the PVN at the same time if there was food to eat. (3) Amphetamine infused into the lateral hypothalamus (LH) by reverse dialysis increased synaptic dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin. (4) The anorectic drug d-fenfluramine increased synaptic serotonin in the LH and also increased the dopamine metabolite DOPAC, suggesting that serotonin and dopamine in the LH might contribute to fenfluramine-induced satiety. Local d-fenfluramine injection into the LH or local infusion by reverse dialysis again increased serotonin and decreased 5-HIAA and interfered with local dopamine metabolism as reflected in decreased DOPAC and HVA. (5) Tryptophan, a serotonin precursor, given systemically at an anorectic dose, increased extracellular serotonin in the LH, but this effect was only detectable in food-deprived rats. This was seemingly pH independent (between 5.8 and 8). The passage other cations through CFo is strictly suppressed (even at pH 8 and with 300 mM NaCl in the medium).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
Document 5 (Title: Influence of photoinhibition, photostimulation and prolactin on pituitary and hypothalamic nuclear androgen receptors in the male hamster.): Testosterone (T) feedback sensitivity is markedly altered in adult male golden hamsters following exposure to short photoperiods (SD). Using a technique which measures total androgen receptors within the cell nucleus, the present study examined pituitary and hypothalamic nuclear androgen receptor levels in animals exposed to (1) long days (LD) or SD in the presence and absence of a constant T level supplied via a Silastic implant, (2) photostimulation following SD-induced testicular regression and (3) short-term prolactin injections following SD-induced testicular regression. Short photoperiods were associated with a drop in nuclear androgen receptor levels which was correlated with a decline in circulating T. When constant T was supplied to gonadectomized hamsters, those exposed to SD possessed higher pituitary and similar hypothalamic nuclear androgen receptor levels than those exposed to LD. As expected, plasma luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels were greatly reduced in SD-exposed, castrated, T-treated hamsters as compared to LD-exposed, castrated, T-treated animals. Photostimulation of intact SD-exposed hamsters for 5 or 10 days was associated with a decline in pituitary nuclear androgen receptors. Prolactin treatment caused no noticeable change in pituitary or hypothalamic androgen receptors even though plasma LH and FSH levels were significantly increased. These results support the hypothesis that altered T feedback mechanisms controlling LH and FSH release following chronic exposure to SD may be related to an alteration in the amount of androgen receptors present in the anterior pituitary.

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
Question: An investigator is studying the function of the lateral nucleus of the hypothalamus in an experimental animal. Using a viral vector, the genes encoding chloride-conducting channelrhodopsins are injected into this nucleus. Photostimulation of the channels causes complete inhibition of action potential generation. Persistent photostimulation is most likely to result in which of the following abnormalities in these animals?
Options:
A. Hypothermia
B. Hyperthermia
C. Polydipsia
D. Anorexia
