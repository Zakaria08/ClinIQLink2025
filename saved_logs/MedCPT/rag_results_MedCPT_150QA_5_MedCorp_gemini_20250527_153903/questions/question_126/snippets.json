        "content": "Ceftriaxone is a third-generation cephalosporin that exhibits saturable plasma protein binding, which influences its pharmacokinetic parameters depending on the dose. Systemic clearance and volume of distribution of total drug show dependence on both concentration and time, whereas for unbound drug these parameters remain constant. The decrease in renal or non-renal clearance with age or in the presence of disease states is often compensated by the concurrent increase in free fraction, resulting in no apparent changes in half-life and no need for dose adjustment. Because of its unusually long plasma half-life, the availability of intramuscular administration and its high intrinsic activity against many organisms, ceftriaxone has become a popular agent in once-daily therapy of infections in paediatric patients, gonococcal infections and outpatient management of pneumonia and osteomyelitis.",

        "content": "Cefotiam is a parenteral second-generation cephalosporin antibiotic. It has broad-spectrum activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. As a beta-lactam, its bactericidal activity results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis via affinity for penicillin-binding proteins. It was patented in 1973 and approved for medical use in 1981. Medical uses This drug is indicated for prophylaxis for surgical infection, postoperative infections, bacterial septicaemia, bone and joint infections, cholangitis, cholecystitis, peritonitis, prostatitis, pyelonephritis, respiratory tract infections, skin and soft tissue infections, cystitis, urethritis, and infections caused by susceptible organisms. It does not have activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Dosage For adults, the dose is up to 6 grams daily by intravenous or intramuscular route in divided doses according to severity of infection. In patients with renal impairment a dose reduction may be needed.",

        "content": "Historically, cefotaxime has been considered to be comparable to ceftriaxone (another third-generation cephalosporin) in safety and efficacy for the treatment of bacterial meningitis, lower respiratory tract infections, skin and soft tissue infections, genitourinary tract infections, and bloodstream infections, as well as prophylaxis for abdominal surgery. The majority of these infections are caused by organisms traditionally sensitive to both cephalosporins. However, ceftriaxone has the advantage of once-daily dosing, whereas the shorter half-life of cefotaxime necessitates two or three daily doses for efficacy. Changing patterns in microbial resistance suggest cefotaxime may be suffering greater resistance than ceftriaxone, whereas the two were previously considered comparable. Considering regional microbial sensitivities is also important when choosing any antimicrobial agent for the treatment of infection.",
