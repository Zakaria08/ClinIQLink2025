        "content": "Diagnosis The first steps in diagnosis are a medical history and physical examination. Important clues during history include weight loss, diarrhea and abdominal pain. During physical examination, the clinician must identify the location of the mass, as well as characterize its location (usually specified in terms of quadrants). The mass should be assessed for whether it is rigid or mobile. It should also be characterized for pulse or peristalsis, as these would help in further identifying the mass. Routine blood tests are usually the next step in diagnosis after a thorough medical history and physical examination. They should include a full blood count, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and liver function tests such as albumin, international normalized ratio (INR), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), serum amylase and total bilirubin (TBIL). If late-stage liver disease is suspected, then a serum glucose may be appropriate.",

        "content": "We describe the case of a 23 years old male, who suffered a 45 bullet wound in the arm and upper right hemithorax. He walked after his injury and 10 minutes later presented dizziness, cough and tachycardia. On admission a minor haemothorax was seen on a chest X ray, but the bullet was not seen. Even without symptoms, an X ray of abdomen showed the missile lying above the left sacroiliac joint. A chest tube was placed, the patient had an excellent recovery and was discharged a week later. After several months he presented hemoptysis and a moderate pain on his right chest and was treated as an acute bronchitis. Six months after his initial injury he developed a florid picture of acute pulmonary embolism (chest pain, dyspnea, hemoptysis, tachycardia, severe cough). A new chest X ray was done and the bullet was shown lying in the right chest. A pulmonary arteriography located it in a lower basal branch. Through a posterolateral thoracotomy the slug was obtained. The recovery was uneventful and he has remained well since. We discuss the possible mechanisms to explain the entrance of the bullet into the vascular system and conclude that in cases of gunshot wounds: a) An exit wound must be always searched for; if not found exploratory X ray are mandatory, b) If the bullet is not found, specially after thoracic injuries, bullet embolism should be contemplated, c) If there are signs of regional ischemia arteriography is mandatory.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "content": "We described two cases of the lateral medullary syndrome (Wallenberg's syndrome) due to vertebral artery dissection following minimal neck injuries. The first case was a 45-year-old man, who hit his head and often rotated his head because of posterior neck discomfort. Two years after the injury, he suffered from sudden sharp neck pain, nausea, and vertigo, which was followed by left hand numbness and difficulty in walking due to the right lateral medullary syndrome. Angiography showed right vertebral artery dissection at the fourth segment. The second case, a 48-year-old man, suffered from neck pain immediately after he hyperextended his neck for painting a wall. Within several hours, he experienced left hand numbness and difficulty in walking due to the lateral medullary syndrome. Angiography showed a saccular aneurysm and dissection of the right vertebral artery at the fourth segment. In both cases, minor traumas were thought to be the causes of vertebral artery dissection. We surveyed previously reported 84 cases (men: 50, women: 34) of the vertebral artery dissection due to minor traumas. Seventy per cent of patients were in their third or fourth decade of life. The main causes of trauma preceding the dissection were neck manipulation especially chiropractics (52%). The third segment was most vulnerable. Delay in onset following neck trauma could be more than a week, but in most cases the delay was less than 24 hours. Cervical rotation and extension were thought to precipitate dissection.",
