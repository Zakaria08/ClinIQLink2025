Document 2 (Title: Symptomatic Carotid Artery Stenosis -- Introduction -- Carotid Artery Stenosis and Coronary Artery Disease): Given that carotid stenosis is an atherosclerotic process, it is not surprising that a significant portion of patients with severe carotid stenosis have concurrent coronary artery disease (CAD). In patients who need coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) and who are known to have severe (>70%) but asymptomatic carotid stenosis, the question arises regarding performing CEA before or at the same time as the CABG. A randomized control trial of 185 patients showed significant benefit for CEA either prior to or at the same time as CABG compared to patients who underwent CEA 1 to 3 months after CABG. The delayed CEA group had a significantly increased risk of perioperative or delayed stroke. [10]
Document 3 (Title: Single staged carotid and coronary arteries surgery. Indications and results.): The frequency of associated carotid and coronary stenosis is estimated to be 40% of cases including asymptomatic patients. The risk of death by myocardial infarction during carotid surgery is in the neighborhood of 1%. With Doppler and ultrasonic imaging, it is now possible to recognize carotid stenosis in 11% of these cases. Depending on the extent of the clinical manifestations caused by one or the other of these lesions, there are several therapeutic options: surgery of the carotid with special protection of the myocardium during and after surgery or simultaneous carotid and coronary surgery in high risk cases. Between 1979 and 1986, simultaneous surgery was performed in 18 cases in our department. During the same period, 1194 carotid endarterectomies and 505 coronary bypasses were performed. These 18 cases included 13 males and 5 females with a mean age of 62 years (range: 43 to 78 years). The procedure performed in these cases were 17 carotid endarterectomies, one bypass of the innominate artery and an average of 2 aorto-coronary bypasses per patient. One death from myocardial infarction occurred in the immediate postoperative period and another patient died suddenly 8 months later. The evolution of arterial disease was evaluated in the other patients. Simultaneous carotid and coronary artery surgery is indicated in high risk carotid and coronary patients. Perusal of the results in the literature allows a better appreciation of the indications and risks of this type of surgery. Our series indicates the necessity for a careful preoperative workup in these patients and the need for more accurate screening to obtain better results.
Document 4 (Title: Outline of cardiology): Coronary circulation disorders Atherosclerosis – Atherosclerosis is the condition in which an artery wall thickens as the result of a build-up of fatty materials (e.g., cholesterol) and white blood cells ("foam cells"). Atherosclerosis of a coronary artery leads to coronary artery disease (CAD). Atherosclerosis is a broad term referring to loss of elasticity of arteries and more specific terms exist — arteriosclerosis and arteriolosclerosis — to narrow which arteries are diseased and can easily be confused due to similar spelling. Overall, atherosclerosis tends to affect the arteries of highest pressure: aorta, coronary, renal, femoral, cerebral, and carotid. Coronary artery disease (CAD)– Coronary artery disease is a general term for any reduction in coronary circulation. One such cause is atherosclerosis. CAD can lead to ischemia (angina pectoris) or infarction (myocardial infarction). Treatment of CAD includes angioplasty, stenting, and coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG).
Document 5 (Title: Carotid artery stenosis): Screening The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends against routine screening for carotid artery stenosis in those without symptoms as of 2021. While routine population screening is not advised, the American Heart Association and the Society for Vascular Surgery recommend screening in those diagnosed with related medical conditions or have risk factors for carotid artery disease. Screening is recommended for people who have: Vascular disease elsewhere in the body, including: Peripheral artery disease (PAD) Coronary artery disease (CAD) Atherosclerotic aortic aneurysm (AAA) Two or more of the following risk factors: High blood pressure (hypertension) High cholesterol (hyperlipidemia) Tobacco smoking Family history – First-degree relative diagnosed with atherosclerosis before age 60 or who suffered an ischemic stroke
