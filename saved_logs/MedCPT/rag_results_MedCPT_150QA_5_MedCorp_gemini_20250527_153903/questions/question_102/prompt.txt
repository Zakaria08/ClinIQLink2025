Document 1 (Title: Vitamin B6 in clinical neurology.): Many conditions in clinical neurology may be responsive to pyridoxine as a therapeutic agent. The current difficulty is in trying to isolate the conditions that are most likely to respond. Treating seizures is a major part of a neurologic practice. Our current therapeutic agents are only partially successful and limited by multiple side effects. One problem is that patients often have to take these agents for an entire lifetime, further raising the risk of toxicity. If pyridoxine supplementation can improve the efficacy of currently used medications, it will be gladly accepted into our therapeutic arsenal. Headache, chronic pain, and depression all appear to run together in many of our patients. The observations that serotonin deficiency is a common thread between them and that pyridoxine can raise serotonin levels open a wide range of therapeutic options. Small studies have been carried out with mixed success. Comparison with amitriptyline in the treatment of headache appears to show about equal efficacy, although side effects would be expected to be more of a problem with the amitriptyline. Behavioral disorders are relatively common and continue to be a major problem, disrupting the lives of the patients and their families. Current treatments are not acceptable to most people because of the risk of side effects with long-term usage. If, as Dr. Feingold suggests, many of these problems are caused by "toxic" exposures to chemicals that are pyridoxine antagonists, supplementation at early ages may reduce the incidence of hyperactivity and aggressive behavior. This raises the question of safety. Is pyridoxine safe for long-term use in large segments of the population, including children? The studies on children with Down's syndrome and autism, utilizing much higher doses than are used for other therapeutic purposes, seem to indicate relative safety if carefully monitored. Studies involving large population groups with carpal tunnel syndrome, all adults, using 100-150 mg/day have shown minimal or no toxicity in five- to 10-year studies. Women self-medicating for PMS taking 500 to 5000 mg/day have shown peripheral neuropathy within one to three years. It would appear from this retrospective analysis that pyridoxine is safe at doses of 100 mg/day or less in adults. In children there is not enough data to make any sort of suggestion. Because the major neurologic complication is a peripheral neuropathy and the causes of this condition are myriad, pyridoxine may cause neuropathy only in patients with a pre-existing susceptibility to this condition.
Document 2 (Title: First_Aid_Step2): SSRIs Fluoxetine, sertraline, paroxetine, citalopram, f uvoxamine Depression and anxiety. Sexual side effects, GI distress, agitation, insomnia, tremor, diarrhea. Serotonin syndrome (fever, myoclonus, mental status changes, cardiovascular collapse) can occur if SSRIs are used with MAOIs. Paroxetine can cause pulmonary hypertension in the fetus. Atypicals Bupropion, venlafaxine, mirtazapine, trazodone Depression, anxiety, and chronic pain. Bupropion: ↓ seizure threshold; minimal sexual side effects. Contraindicated in patients with eating disorders as well as in seizure patients. Venlafaxine: Diastolic hypertension. Mirtazapine: Weight gain, sedation. Trazodone: Highly sedating; priapism. Nortriptyline, desipramine, amitriptyline, imipramine Depression, anxiety disorder, chronic pain, migraine headaches, enuresis (imipramine). Lethal with overdose owing to cardiac conduction arrhythmias (e.g., long QRS). Monitor in the ICU for 3–4 days following an OD. Anticholinergic effects (dry
Document 3 (Title: Amitriptyline): Amitriptiline counteracts the antihypertensive action of guanethidine. When given with amitriptyline, other anticholinergic agents may result in hyperpyrexia or paralytic ileus. Co-administration of amitriptyline and disulfiram is not recommended due to the potential for the development of toxic delirium. Amitriptyline causes an unusual type of interaction with the anticoagulant phenprocoumon during which great fluctuations of the prothrombin time have been observed. Pharmacology Pharmacodynamics Amitriptyline inhibits serotonin transporter (SERT) and norepinephrine transporter (NET). It is metabolized to nortriptyline, a stronger norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, further augmenting amitriptyline's effects on norepinephrine reuptake (see the Table on the right). Amitriptyline additionally acts as a potent inhibitor of the serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, the α1A-adrenergic, the histamine H1 and the M1-M5 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (see the Table on the right).
Document 4 (Title: Diphenhydramine): Acute poisoning can be fatal, leading to cardiovascular collapse and death in 2–18 hours, and in general is treated using a symptomatic and supportive approach. Diagnosis of toxicity is based on history and clinical presentation, and in general specific levels are not useful. Several levels of evidence strongly indicate diphenhydramine (similar to chlorpheniramine) can block the delayed rectifier potassium channel and, as a consequence, prolong the QT interval, leading to cardiac arrhythmias such as torsades de pointes. No specific antidote for diphenhydramine toxicity is known, but the anticholinergic syndrome has been treated with physostigmine for severe delirium or tachycardia. Benzodiazepines may be administered to decrease the likelihood of psychosis, agitation, and seizures in people who are prone to these symptoms. Interactions Alcohol may increase the drowsiness caused by diphenhydramine. Pharmacology Pharmacodynamics
Document 5 (Title: Imipramine -- Monitoring): Treatment with imipramine and other tricyclics usually requires a duration of around 4 to 5 weeks to elicit a good response. Research has shown that increasing the dose of imipramine to greater than 300ng/mL effectively treated severe depression. However, when the drug level greatly exceeds 300ng/mL, it will be more likely to be associated with significant and serious side effects. Extreme precautions are necessary, especially in a patient with cardiovascular disease, including conduction defects, tachycardia, acute myocardial infarction, and hepatic impairment. When coadministering imipramine with a MOAI, it can lead to fatal hypertensive crisis or seizures. When imipramine is co-ingested with SSRI, it can cause serotonin syndrome. [7] [5]
