The goal is weight loss of no more than 1.0 kg/day for people with both ascites and peripheral edema and no more than 0.5 kg/day for people with ascites alone. If daily weights cannot be obtained, diuretics can also be guided by the urinary sodium concentration. Dosage is increased until a negative sodium balance occurs. A random urine sodium-to-potassium ratio of > 1 is 90% sensitivity in predicting negative balance (> 78-mmol/day sodium excretion). Diuretic resistance: Diuretic resistance can be predicted by giving 80 mg intravenous furosemide after 3 days without diuretics and on an 80 mEq sodium/day diet. The urinary sodium excretion over 8 hours < 50 mEq/8 hours predicts resistance.",

        "content": "a natriuresis occurs in response to an osmotic diuresis associated with hyperglycemia. Moreover, in patients with DKA, thirst is very common and water ingestion often continues. The plasma potassium concentration is usually mildly elevated, but in the face of acidosis, and as a result of the ongoing osmotic diuresis, a significant total-body deficit of potassium is almost always present. Recognition of the total-body deficit of potassium is critically important. The inclusion of potassium replacement in the therapeutic regimen at the appropriate time and with the appropriate indications (see below) is essential. Volume depletion is a very common finding in DKA and is a pivotal component in the pathogenesis of the disorder.",

        "content": "The classic presentation of DKA, consisting of hyperglycemia, anion gap acidosis, and ketonuria, is readily recognized. The diagnosis may be missed, however, in the patient who is euglycemic, has a negative nitroprusside test for ketones, or has a nonanion gap metabolic acidosis. Treatment includes replacement of fluid and electrolytes lost through osmotic diuresis. Failure to recognize the magnitude of total-body potassium depletion and to begin replacement despite an initially normal serum potassium level may lead to fatal cardiac arrhythmia. Serum glucose must be monitored closely to avoid hypoglycemia; dextrose should be added to the infusion once the serum glucose falls to 250 mg per dl. Insulin is required to reverse ketoacid production by the liver; low-dose therapy is recommended. Ketogenesis may be reversed inadequately unless insulin treatment is continued until the anion gap has normalized. Failure to recognize precipitating causes may result in increased morbidity and mortality from underlying infection or myocardial infarction as well as rapid relapse of ketoacidosis.",

        "content": "Aggressive volume resuscitation with isotonic saline infusion is recommended in the initial management of DKA. Volume expansion not only corrects the hemodynamic instability but also improves insulin sensitivity and reduces counter-regulatory hormone levels. After starting with isotonic saline, the subsequent options can be decided on the serum sodium levels that are corrected for the level of hyperglycemia. Normal or high serum sodium levels warrant replacement with hypotonic saline, and low sodium levels warrant continuation of the isotonic saline. This fluid has to be supplemented with dextrose once the level reaches around 200 to 250 mg/dl. Along with fluids, an intravenous infusion of regular insulin has to be initiated to maintain the blood glucose level between 150 to 200 mg/dl and until the high anion-gap acidosis is resolved in DKA. Like mentioned above, potassium levels are usually high because of the transcellular shifts due to the acidosis and the lack of insulin. When the potassium levels are low, this means that the total body potassium is low, and hence, insulin therapy should be postponed till at least the level of serum potassium is greater than 3.3 mEq/L. Otherwise, a\u00a0further drop in levels would put the patient at risk for cardiac arrhythmias. In the 3.3 to 5 mEq/L; range, supplementation should be added in the maintenance fluids to target a steady 4.0 to 5.0 mEq/L range, and if higher than that, insulin and intravenous fluids alone can be started with just the frequent monitoring of the serum potassium level. The treatment of the acidosis itself is more controversial. Treatment with sodium bicarbonate therapy is controversial. It has been studied and found to provide no added benefit when the arterial blood pH is greater than 6.9 and may be associated with more harm. [7] A 2011 systematic review found that bicarbonate administration worsened ketonemia. Several studies have found higher potassium requirements in patients receiving bicarbonate. Studies in children have observed\u00a0a possible association between bicarbonate therapy and cerebral edema. [8]",
