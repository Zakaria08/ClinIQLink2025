Document 1 (Title: Seroconversion): sufficient quantities of antibodies or any specific antibodies against COVID-19 at all. Significantly older patients of greater than eighty years old are more likely to have higher quantities of IgG antibodies compared to younger patients at the time of infection. This is consistent with the fact that older patients tend to have more severe COVID-19 infections and thus have higher viral loads compared to younger patients. However, this increased antibody load tends to decrease after about three months post-recovery compared to younger patients, compared to the six to seven months observed in the general population. This implies that the resistance may not last long-term in older individuals, leaving them suspectible to subsequent COVID-19 infections. Some studies have disputed the link between concentrations of antibodies of either IgM or IgG and the severity of the disease course.
Document 2 (Title: Selective IgA Deficiency -- Introduction): Immunoglobulin A (IgA) deficiency is the most common primary immunodeficiency characterized by a decreased amount of serum IgA and a concomitant lack of secretory IgA. Other immunoglobulin levels are normal. By the International Consensus definition, the diagnosis is established in individuals older than four years whose blood levels of IgA are below 7 mg/dl but have normal levels of IgG and IgM. (IgE is  normal too.) These individuals have a normal antibody response to vaccines. Nevertheless, IgA deficiency should be excluded from other causes of hypogammaglobulinemia and defects in T lymphocytes. Patients who suffer from selective IgA deficiency may have clinical symptoms, but most are largely asymptomatic. [1] [2] IgA deficiency is often associated with normal CD4 and CD8 T cells, with normal B lymphocytes in the systemic circulation. Some patients, though,  may harbor anti-IgA autoantibodies.
Document 3 (Title: Expansion of a suppressor T-cell population associated with the hyper-IgM syndrome and generalized lymphadenopathy.): Immunoglobulin deficiency with increased IgM (hyper-IgM recurrent infection syndrome) is thought to be due to a defect of IgM/IgG isotype switching in B cells. Considerable genetic heterogeneity (X-linked, autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive inheritance, acquired forms) exists. We describe a case of hyper-IgM syndrome associated with massive lymphadenopathy in a 10-year-old girl with normal B-cell function. Absolute and relative increases of T-suppressor cells (CD8+) and a decrease of circulating CD4+ ("helper") cells were observed. The CD4+ cells present were all of the CD45R+ subtype, representing relatively immature ("naive") helper cells. In contrast, the number of CD4+ cells within the lymph nodes was increased. When tested fractionally, the patient's CD8+ cells selectively inhibited synthesis of IgG and IgA by normal B cells, but spared IgM. Normal allogenic T cells could induce IgG and IgA production by the patient's B cells. These findings suggest (a) a state of selective suppression of IgG and IgA synthesis with exclusive production of IgM, and (b) an abnormal recirculation of immature T-helper cells. This case represents a variant of this heterogeneous syndrome resembling the findings in neonatal lymphocytes and can be distinguished from the "adult" form of hyper-IgM syndrome which may be due to defective switch T cells.
Document 4 (Title: Pathology_Robbins): Despite impressive advances in our understanding and treatment of HIV infection, the long-term prognosis of patients with AIDS remains a concern. Although with effective drug therapy the mortality rate has declined in the United States, the treated patients still carry viral DNA in their lymphoid tissues. Truly curative therapy remains elusive. Similarly, although considerable effort has been mounted to develop a protective vaccine, many hurdles remain before this becomes a reality. Molecular analyses have revealed an alarming degree of variation in viral isolates from patients; this renders the task of producing a vaccine extremely difficult. Recent efforts have focused on producing broadly neutralizing antibodies against relatively invariant portions of HIV proteins. At present, therefore, prevention, public health measures, and anti-retroviral drugs remain the mainstays in the fight against AIDS. Progression of disease. HIVinfectionprogressesthroughphases.
Document 5 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): marker of disease progression. In patients with CD4+ T cell counts >200/ μL, the differential diagnosis of lymphadenopathy includes KS, TB, Castleman’s disease, and lymphoma. In patients with more advanced disease, lymphadenopathy may also be due to atypical mycobacterial infection, toxoplasmosis, systemic fungal infection, or bacillary angiomatosis. While indicated in patients with CD4+ T cell counts <200/μL, lymph node biopsy is not indicated in patients with early-stage disease unless there are signs and symptoms of systemic illness, such as fever and weight loss, or unless the nodes begin to enlarge, become fixed, or coalesce. Monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS) (Chap. 136), defined as the presence of a serum monoclonal IgG, IgA, or IgM in the absence of a clear cause, has been reported in 3% of patients with HIV infection. The overall clinical significance of this finding in patients with HIV infection is unclear, although it has been associated with other viral

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
Question: A 6-year-old male who recently immigrated to the United States from Asia is admitted to the hospital with dyspnea. Physical exam reveals a gray pseudomembrane in the patient's oropharynx along with lymphadenopathy. The patient develops myocarditis and expires on hospital day 5. Which of the following would have prevented this patient's presentation and decline?
Options:
A. Increased CD4+ T cell count
B. Secretory IgA against viral proteins
C. Increased IgM preventing bacterial invasion
D. Circulating IgG against AB exotoxin
