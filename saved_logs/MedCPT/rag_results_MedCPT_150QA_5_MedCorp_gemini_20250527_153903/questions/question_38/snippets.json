        "title": "[A nosological study of a patient showing ataxia &amp; lower motor neuron involvement].",
        "content": "A sporadic case of spinocerebellar degeneration with prominent involvement of the motor system has recently been encountered. A 54-year-old man without family history noticed speech disturbance at the age of 46 and weakness in his right hand the following year. The muscle weakness and atrophy were slowly progressive and made walk impossible at the age of 50, when his dysphagia increased. At the age of 54, he was admitted to our hospital when neurological findings revealed marked amyotrophy of general skeletal muscle and tongue with fasciculation. Deep tendon reflexes were decreased. Cerebellar ataxia was impossible to evaluate because of profound muscle weakness. And sensory disturbance was suspected in the distal portion of the lower extremities. CT scan revealed progressive atrophy of the brain stem and cerebellum. The patient died at the age of 54 due to CO2 narcosis. The clinical course was 8 years. A summary of the pathological findings was as follows: 1) Marked neuronal loss of the anterior horn of the spinal cord and motor cranial nerve nuclei except for oculomotor nuclei, with mild degeneration of pyramidal tract below lumbosacral level. 2) Degeneration of cerebellipetal system, spinocerebellar tract, Clarke's column and the middle root zone and cerebellifugal system, dentate nucleus, superior cerebellar peduncles, and red nucleus. 3) Mild degeneration of pontine nuclei, inferior olivary nuclei, pontine transverse fibers, the middle and inferior cerebellar peduncles, cerebellar white matter and Purkinje cells as in OPCA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "content": "A classic example of solely LMN paralysis, poliomyelitis, has a fecal-oral transmission and is caused by a type of picornavirus: poliovirus. Once infected, the virus replicated in the oropharynx and small intestine before spreading via the bloodstream to the CNS. While replicating in the Peyer's patches of the small intestine, 95% of patients are asymptomatic, and it can only be found in the stool or via an oral swab. [5] In the CNS, the virus destroys the anterior (ventral) horn of the spinal cord, resulting in LMN paralysis. Because LMNs originate in the anterior horn of the spinal cord, this results in LMN signs such as asymmetric weakness, flaccid paralysis, fasciculations, hyporeflexia, and muscle atrophy. The infection could also result in respiratory involvement leading to respiratory paralysis. Other systemic signs of infection include fever, headache, nausea, and malaise. The cerebrospinal fluid would demonstrate increased WBC's and a slight elevation of protein, which is consistent with the viral infection. Once a prominent cause of paralysis, poliomyelitis has almost been eradicated due to widespread vaccination. [6] [7]",

        "content": "Spinal polio, the most common form of paralytic poliomyelitis, results from viral invasion of the motor neurons of the anterior horn cells, or the ventral (front) grey matter section in the spinal column, which are responsible for movement of the muscles, including those of the trunk, limbs, and the intercostal muscles. Virus invasion causes inflammation of the nerve cells, leading to damage or destruction of motor neuron ganglia. When spinal neurons die, Wallerian degeneration takes place, leading to weakness of those muscles formerly innervated by the now-dead neurons. With the destruction of nerve cells, the muscles no longer receive signals from the brain or spinal cord; without nerve stimulation, the muscles atrophy, becoming weak, floppy and poorly controlled, and finally completely paralyzed. Maximum paralysis progresses rapidly (two to four days), and usually involves fever and muscle pain. Deep tendon reflexes are also affected, and are typically absent or diminished;",
