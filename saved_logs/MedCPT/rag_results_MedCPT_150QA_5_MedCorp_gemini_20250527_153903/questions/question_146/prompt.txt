Document 2 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): DERMATOPHYTE (MOLD) INFECTIONS Etiologic Agents The molds that cause skin infections in humans include the genera Trichophyton, Microsporum, and Epidermophyton. These organisms, which are not components of the normal skin flora, 1357 can live within the keratinized structures of the skin—hence the term dermatophytes.
Document 3 (Title: [Shifts in the species spectrum of mycoses in The Netherlands from 1970-1990].): A review is presented of yeast and mould infections occurring in humans in the Netherlands. The occurrence of the dermatophytes Trichophyton rubrum and T. mentagrophytes tends to increase, while Microsporum canis and particularly Epidermophyton floccosum have become less common. The yeast Candida glabrata is particularly often involved in infections of the urinary tract. Candida krusei, C. parapsilosis and C. tropicalis have become less significant. Remarkable differences are found between the spectra of Aspergillus species causing infections in lungs and in ears; an entirely different pathogenesis is to be presumed. The number of systemic mycoses in the Netherlands is underestimated. The possibility of hundreds of cases each year cannot be excluded.
Document 4 (Title: Tinea Manuum -- Etiology): Tinea manuum is caused by dermatophytes, the most common of which worldwide is Trichophyton rubrum . However, different etiologic organisms have been reported in various geographical locations, including: [2] Trichophyton mentagrophytes [3] Epidermophyton floccosum Trichophyton verrucosum Trichophyton interdigitale Microsporum canis
Document 5 (Title: Onychomycosis -- Etiology): The most frequent cause of onychomycosis is Trichophyton rubrum, but other dermatophytes, including Trichophyton mentagrophytes and Epidermophyton floccosum, can also cause it. The dermatophytes are identified in 90% of the toenail and 50% of fingernail onychomycosis. [5] Candida albicans cases account for 2% of onychomycosis, especially in fingernails. Nondermatophytic mold onychomycosis is cultured primarily from toenails. Examples of these saprophytic molds include Fusarium, Aspergillus, Acremonium, Scytalidium, and Scopulariopsis brevicaulis, [6] accounting for about 8% of nail infections. [7]
