        "content": "In a retrospective study of 106 patients with complete follow-up of dog bites treated in the emergency department the following factors greatly increased the risk of infection: age greater than 50 years, delay in seeking treatment, location on an upper extremity, and puncture wounds. Debridement and irrigation decreased the incidence of infection, and sutured wounds were not more likely to become infected than those left open. Prophylactic antibiotics provided no benefit in this series. In the literature, overall infection rates varied widely according to the various patient populations. Up to 50% of infections from dog bites are caused by pasturella multocida, and the remainder by a wide range of organisms, including streptococcus. Ninety-five percent of these organisms will be sensitive to penicillin.",

        "content": "Most vaccines are administered before a patient has contracted a disease to help increase future protection. However, some vaccines are administered after the patient already has contracted a disease. Vaccines given after exposure to smallpox are reported to offer some protection from disease or may reduce the severity of disease. The first rabies immunization was given by Louis Pasteur to a child after he was bitten by a rabid dog. Since its discovery, the rabies vaccine has been proven effective in preventing rabies in humans when administered several times over 14 days along with rabies immune globulin and wound care. Other examples include experimental AIDS, cancer and Alzheimer's disease vaccines. Such immunizations aim to trigger an immune response more rapidly and with less harm than natural infection.",
