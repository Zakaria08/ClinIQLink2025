Document 1 (Title: Valproate Toxicity -- Treatment / Management): Other interventions to consider early for patients with valproate toxicity are gastrointestinal decontamination and lavage. If the patient presents within 2 hours of a valproate overdose, activated charcoal may be used for gastrointestinal decontamination. Valproate is available in enteric-coated and extended-release formulations, which have slow absorption. Administration of activated charcoal may be considered beyond 2 hours from ingestion for patients who have taken enteric-coated and extended-release valproate formulations. [25] The dose of activated charcoal is 1 g/kg of body weight. If the patient cannot swallow reliably, the administration of activated charcoal should be withheld. Gastric lavage may also be considered to eliminate valproate from the digestive tract. Food and Drug Administration guidelines indicate that gastric lavage treatment may be effective up to 10 or 12 hours after drug intake. [26]
Document 2 (Title: Paracetamol): Treatment is aimed at removing the paracetamol from the body and replenishing glutathione. Activated charcoal can be used to decrease absorption of paracetamol if the person comes to the hospital soon after the overdose. While the antidote, acetylcysteine (also called N-acetylcysteine or NAC), acts as a precursor for glutathione, helping the body regenerate enough to prevent or at least decrease the possible damage to the liver; a liver transplant is often required if damage to the liver becomes severe. NAC was usually given following a treatment nomogram (one for people with risk factors, and one for those without), but the use of the nomogram is no longer recommended as evidence to support the use of risk factors was poor and inconsistent, and many of the risk factors are imprecise and difficult to determine with sufficient certainty in clinical practice. Toxicity of paracetamol is due to its quinone metabolite NAPQI and NAC also helps in neutralizing it. Kidney failure is also a
Document 3 (Title: Recent developments in the management of paracetamol (acetaminophen) poisoning.): Paracetamol (acetaminophen) poisoning accounts for almost a third of admissions to our district poisons unit, and is the commonest cause of death in such patients. Antidotal treatment may be effective up to 10h after overdose with oral methionine or up to 24h with acetylcysteine (not 15h as previously suggested for the latter). Patients taking paracetamol overdose while also receiving drugs which induce hepatic enzymes are more susceptible to liver damage, and antidotal treatment may be necessary at lower plasma paracetamol concentrations (50% of the normal treatment line). As survival following liver transplantation is now increasing, it is important to identify early prognostic indicators in fulminant hepatic failure, so that those patients with a high chance of fatal outcome can be considered for transplantation. Useful indicators are the presence of acidosis, marked prolongation of prothrombin time or a continued rise in prothrombin time on day 4 after the overdose. There is no evidence that paracetamol or acetylcysteine are teratogenic in pregnancy. Delays in administering acetylcysteine after paracetamol poisoning in pregnancy have been shown to increase the risk of spontaneous abortion and fetal death. Thus, acetylcysteine should be started as early as possible where treatment is indicated.
Document 4 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): acetaminophen overdose is suspected to have occurred within a few hours of presentation, administration of activated charcoal may be useful to reduce the volume of acetamino-phen present in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. N-acetylcysteine (NAC), the clinically effective antidote for acetaminophen over-dose, should be administered as early as possible to any patient with suspected acetaminophen-associated ALF.35 NAC also should be administered to patients with ALF of unclear etiol-ogy because replenishing glutathione may be beneficial in this patient population as well.36 NAC can be administered either orally (140 mg/kg initial dose, followed by 70 mg/kg every 4 hours × 17 doses) or via the intravenous route (loading dose of 150 mg/kg, followed by a maintenance dose of 50 mg/kg every 4 hours × 12 doses). For patients who are suspected of having drug-induced hepatotoxicity, it is important to obtain details regarding all prescription and nonprescription drugs, herbs, and dietary
Document 5 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): B. Gastrointestinal Tract Controversy remains regarding the efficacy of gastrointestinal decontamination, especially when treatment is initiated more than 1 hour after ingestion. For most ingestions, clinical toxicologists recommend simple administration of activated charcoal to bind ingested poisons in the gut before they can be absorbed (as in the case study). In unusual circumstances, gastric lavage or whole bowel irrigation may also be used.
