Document 1 (Title: Case Study: 32-Year-Old Male Presenting with Right Lower Quadrant Abdominal Pain (Archived) -- Case Presentation): The patient denies prior abdominal surgeries. He does smoke a half pack of cigarettes a day, drinks alcohol socially, and denies any recreational drug use. He notes no inherited medical conditions in his family. Vital signs on arrival: Blood pressure (BP) 120/73 Heart rate (HR) 60 RR 18 Temperature: 35.6 C Oxygen saturation: 98% on room air Height 5'10" (178 cm) Weight 154 lbs (70 kg)
Document 2 (Title: [Bronchiectasis treated with negative extra-thoracic pressure ventilation].): A 25-year old man with 5-year history of bronchiectasis was admitted to the ICU complaining of severe shortness of breath. He had a respiratory rate of 40 to 50 breath/min. On 0.5 l/min of oxygen with nasal cannula, arterial blood pH was 7.39, Paco2 52.3 mmHg, Pao2 45.0 mmHg. Then, on 1 l/min of oxygen, Pao2 was unchanged, but Paco2 increased to 58 mmHg. As his consciousness was so clear, we applied to him the negative extra-thoracic pressure ventilator which was designed by the authors. Negative extra-thoracic pressure ventilation (NETPV) was maintained at a IMV rate of 30 breath/min, peak negative extra-thoracic pressure of -20 to -30 cmH2O, and an inspiratory/expiratory ratio of 1:2. During NETPV, his respiratory rate and oxygen consumption were decreased and Pao2 was increased compared with his spontaneous breathing. He made a recovery from dyspnea, especially, he was able to take a deep breath. When NETPV was applied to him, pulmonary artery and arterial catheterizations revealed that central venous pressure was slightly decreased, cardiac index unchanged or slightly decreased, heart rate, systemic blood pressure, and pulmonary arterial pressure unchanged compared with spontaneous breathing. The patient was able to read books and maintained communication in his voice with his family and the medical staff. After 3 days of the treatment with NETPV, a marked improvement was noted and the patient was discharged from the ICU. NETPV has the benefits as follows. First, it is very easy for both a patient and a doctor to assist his breathing because an endotracheal intubation is not necessary.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Document 3 (Title: Community-acquired pneumonia): Hospitalization Some CAP patients require intensive care, with clinical prediction rules such as the pneumonia severity index and CURB-65 guiding the decision whether or not to hospitalize. Factors increasing the need for hospitalization include: Age greater than 65 Underlying chronic illnesses Respiratory rate greater than 30 per minute Systolic blood pressure less than 90 mmHg Heart rate greater than 125 per minute Temperature below 35 or over 40 °C Confusion Evidence of infection outside the lung Laboratory results indicating hospitalization include: Arterial oxygen tension less than 60 mm Hg Carbon dioxide over 50 mmHg or pH under 7.35 while breathing room air Hematocrit under 30 percent Creatinine over 1.2 mg/dl or blood urea nitrogen over 20 mg/dl White-blood-cell count under 4 × 10^9/L or over 30 × 10^9/L Neutrophil count under 1 x 10^9/L
Document 4 (Title: Neurology_Adams): As a demonstration of destruction of the medulla, it has become customary to perform an “apnea test” to demonstrate unresponsiveness of the medullary centers to a high carbon dioxide tension. This test is conducted by first employing preoxygenation of the lungs for several minutes with high inspired oxygen tension, the purpose of which is to displace nitrogen from the alveoli and create a reservoir of oxygen that will diffuse into the pulmonary circulation. The patient can then be disconnected from the respirator for several minutes, during which time 100 percent oxygen is being delivered by cannula or ventilator that has its pumping mechanism turned off; this allows the arterial PCO2 to rise to above 50 or 60 mm Hg (typically, CO2 rises approximately 2.5 mm Hg/min at normal body temperature—slower if the patient is hypothermic). The induced hypercarbia serves both as a stimulus to breathing and confirms that spontaneous ventilation mediated by medullary centers has failed. (Of
Document 5 (Title: Naloxone -- Monitoring): For those whose respiratory depression is completely reversed with 0.4 to 2 mg of naloxone, observation in the emergency room for 2 to 4 hours is advised. If the patient is stable, discharge is recommended. In general, patients considered for discharge after reversal of the opioid overdose with naloxone should have: [27] A Glasgow coma scale of 15 No need for additional naloxone doses An oxygen saturation of at least 92% on room air A respiration rate of no less than 10 breaths/min A pulse rate of no less than 50 bpm or no more than 120 bpm A blood pressure between 110/90 and 140/90 mm Hg Tolerance for clear liquids, ambulation, and have no withdrawal symptoms Someone to drive home and monitor the patient for the next 12 to 24 hours

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
Question: A 27-year-old man presents to the emergency room with persistent fever, nausea, and vomiting for the past 3 days. While waiting to be seen, he quickly becomes disoriented and agitated. Upon examination, he has visible signs of difficulty breathing with copious oral secretions and generalized muscle twitching. The patient’s temperature is 104°F (40°C), blood pressure is 90/64 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min with an oxygen saturation of 90% on room air. When the nurse tries to place a nasal cannula, the patient becomes fearful and combative. The patient is sedated and placed on mechanical ventilation. Which of the following is a risk factor for the patient’s most likely diagnosis?
Options:
A. Contaminated beef
B. Epiglottic cyst
C. Mosquito bite
D. Spelunking
