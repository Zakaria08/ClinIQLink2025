Document 1 (Title: Lambert–Eaton myasthenic syndrome): Signs and symptoms The weakness from LEMS typically involves the muscles of the proximal arms and legs (the muscles closer to the trunk). In contrast to myasthenia gravis, the weakness affects the legs more than the arms. This leads to difficulties climbing stairs and rising from a sitting position. Weakness is often relieved temporarily after exertion or physical exercise. High temperatures can worsen the symptoms. Weakness of the bulbar muscles (muscles of the mouth and throat) is occasionally encountered. Weakness of the eye muscles is uncommon. Some may have double vision, drooping of the eyelids and difficulty swallowing, but generally only together with leg weakness; this too distinguishes LEMS from myasthenia gravis, in which eye signs are much more common. In the advanced stages of the disease, weakness of the respiratory muscles may occur. Some may also experience problems with coordination (ataxia).
Document 2 (Title: Case Study: 33-Year-Old Female Presents with Chronic SOB and Cough (Archived) -- Case Presentation): History of Present Illness: A 33-year-old white female presents after admission to the general medical/surgical hospital ward with a chief complaint of shortness of breath on exertion. She reports that she was seen for similar symptoms previously at her primary care physician’s office six months ago. At that time, she was diagnosed with acute bronchitis and treated with bronchodilators, empiric antibiotics, and a short course oral steroid taper. This management did not improve her symptoms, and she has gradually worsened over six months. She reports a 20-pound (9 kg) intentional weight loss over the past year. She denies camping, spelunking, or hunting activities. She denies any sick contacts. A brief review of systems is negative for fever, night sweats, palpitations, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, neural sensation changes, muscular changes, and increased bruising or bleeding. She admits a cough, shortness of breath, and shortness of breath on exertion.
Document 3 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): Introduction to Autonomic Pharmacology Bertram G. Katzung, MD, PhD A 56-year-old woman is brought to the university eye center with a complaint of “loss of vision.” Because of visual impair-ment, she has lost her driver’s license and has fallen several times in her home. Examination reveals that her eyelids close involuntarily with a frequency and duration sufficient to pre-vent her from seeing her surroundings for more than brief moments at a time. When she holds her eyelids open with her fingers, she can see normally. She has no other muscle dysfunction. A diagnosis of blepharospasm is made. Using a fine needle, several injections of botulinum toxin type A are made in the orbicularis oculi muscle of each eyelid. After observation in the waiting area, she is sent home. Two days later, she reports by telephone that her vision has improved dramatically. How did botulinum toxin improve her vision? How long can her vision be expected to remain normal after this single treatment?
Document 4 (Title: [Detection of immune complexes in the sera and around the muscle fibers in a case of myasthenia gravis and polymyositis].): A case of myasthenia gravis accompanied with polymyositis and malignant thymoma, detected immune complexes in the sera and around the muscle fibers, was described. A 37-year-old woman was admitted to Shinshu University Hospital in September, 1987 because of dyspnea, dysphagia and muscle weakness. She first noticed her right blepharoptosis 3 weeks before admission. Weakness of all four limbs and myalgia of lower extremities were noticed one week later. These symptoms got worse and nocturnal dyspnea, dysphagia and easy fatigability at mastication appeared. On admission, she looked ill and neurological examination revealed left blepharoptosis, bilateral facial weakness, weakness of all four limbs, more prominent in proximal muscles and tenderness of lower extremities. Edrophonium test was positive, improving her muscle weakness. Laboratory examination revealed the elevated serum levels of CK, the increased titre of circulating immune complexes and high titres of acetylcholine receptor antibodies and anti-skeletal muscle antibodies. Electromyographic study showed myogenic pattern and Harvey-Masland test revealed waning at low frequency stimulation. Muscle biopsy showed marked perivascular infiltration of lymphocytes, accompanied by phagocytosis and interstitial fibrosis. IgG deposits were shown around the muscle fibers exclusively around the infiltrates of mononuclear cells. Granular deposits of C3 were also shown specifically around the muscle fibers exclusively around the infiltrates of mononuclear cells. Thymectomy was performed on September 21, 1987. Invasion of thymoma, predominantly lymphocytic type, to right lung and pericardium was observed histologically. After thymectomy, she got better. Immunological data and immunohistochemical examination of the present case suggest that in the case of myasthenia gravis accompanied with polymyositis and malignant thymoma, immune complexes may play a primary role on the pathogenesis of myositis.
Document 5 (Title: [Reducing body myopathy--a case report].): A 2-year-old girl with reducing body myopathy was reported. She had no family history of neuromuscular disease. She developed normally with no delay in milestones during infancy. She had no muscle weakness or hypotonia up to 2 years of age when she received mumps vaccination. Three days after the injection, she was first noticed to have limb muscle weakness. The muscle weakness progressed rapidly with increasing difficulty in gait and raising the upper arms, particularly the left. Four months later, she had difficulty in keeping her head up and could no longer climb the stairs. On physical examination, she had proximal dominant generalized muscle weakness, with a preferential neck muscle involvement. She walked waddlingly and stood up with Gowers' maneuver. Facial and ocular muscles were intact. No dysarthria, dysphagia or respiratory difficulty was noted. EMG showed myopathic pattern. Serum creatine kinase level was moderately elevated to 739 IU/l. In the biopsied left biceps muscle, there was marked variation in fiber size, but no apparent necrotic or regenerating fibers. The most striking feature was the presence of numerous eosinophilic inclusions which reduced nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) and were, therefore, stained dark with menadione-linked alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase even without the substrate of menadione, showing the histochemical characteristics of "reducing" body. The bodies were predominantly seen in fibers with disorganized intermyofibrillar networks and with high acid phosphatase activity. On electron microscopy, the reducing bodies consisted of fine granular material with the similar electron density to the chromatin granules and were located mostly around the degenerated nuclei, suggesting the nuclear degeneration playing a role in forming the reducing bodies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
Question: A 35-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 1-month history of double vision, difficulty climbing stairs, and weakness when trying to brush her hair. She reports that these symptoms are worse after she exercises and disappear after she rests for a few hours. Physical examination shows drooping of her right upper eyelid that worsens when the patient is asked to gaze at the ceiling for 2 minutes. There is diminished motor strength in the upper extremities. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options:
A. Myasthenia gravis
B. Polymyositis
C. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
D. Multiple sclerosis
