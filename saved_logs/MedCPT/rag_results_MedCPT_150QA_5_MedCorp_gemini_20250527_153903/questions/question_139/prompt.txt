With your own knowledge and the help of the following document:

Document 1 (Title: Progestins -- Contraindications): Women who have undergone bariatric surgery and those taking certain medications that induce hepatic enzymes, such as antibiotics (rifampin), antifungals (griseofulvin), and anticonvulsants (phenytoin, carbamazepine, topiramate, and barbiturates) are advised not to use combined or progestin-only contraception. [10] [17] [18]
Document 2 (Title: Combined oral contraceptive pill): Combined oral contraception decreases total testosterone levels by approximately 0.5 nmol/l, free testosterone by approximately 60%, and increases the amount of sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) by approximately 100 nmol/l. Contraceptives containing second generation progestins and/or estrogen doses of around 20 –25 mg EE were found to have less impact on SHBG concentrations. Combined oral contraception may also reduce bone density. Drug interactions Some drugs reduce the effect of the pill and can cause breakthrough bleeding, or increased chance of pregnancy. These include drugs such as rifampicin, barbiturates, phenytoin and carbamazepine. In addition cautions are given about broad spectrum antibiotics, such as ampicillin and doxycycline, which may cause problems "by impairing the bacterial flora responsible for recycling ethinylestradiol from the large bowel" (BNF 2003).
Document 3 (Title: Sultamicillin versus trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole in the treatment of urinary tract infections.): Sultamicillin, a novel compound in which ampicillin and the beta-lactamase inhibitor sulbactam are linked as a double ester, was compared with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole with regard to in vitro activity, therapeutic efficacy and safety in the treatment of UTIs. The MICs of ampicillin and ampicillin in combination with sulbactam (10 micrograms), trimethoprim and trimethoprim in combination with sulfamethoxazole (1:19) were determined for 400 isolates causing UTI using an agar dilution technique (multipointer, cfu = 10(4]. The organisms isolated consisted of about one-third E. coli, one-third other Gram-negative strains and one-third Gram-positive strains. About half of the Gram-positive strains were enterococci and the other half staphylococci. A concentration of 8 micrograms/ml ampicillin inhibited 76% of the isolates while ampicillin in combination with sulbactam inhibited 86%. A concentration of 4 micrograms/ml trimethoprim inhibited 77% of the isolates, while trimethoprim in combination with sulfamethoxazole inhibited 83%. In a prospectively randomized clinical trial, 38 patients with UTI were treated orally with either sultamicillin (375 mg) or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (160 mg/800 mg) twice daily for 7 d. Sultamicillin eradicated bacteriuria during therapy and up to 1 to 2 weeks after therapy in 63% and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole in 50% of evaluable patients. Side effects were reported for 2 sultamicillin (gastric pain, diarrhea) and 2 trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole patients (gastric pain, exanthema), with the latter 2 being withdrawn after 6 days of therapy. Sultamicillin appeared as effective and safe as trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole in the treatment of UTI.
Document 4 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): The most important use of combined estrogens and progestins is for oral contraception. A large number of preparations are available for this specific purpose, some of which are listed in Table 40–3. They are specially packaged for ease of administration. In general, they are very effective; when these agents are taken according to directions, the risk of conception is extremely small. The pregnancy rate with combination agents is estimated to be about 5–12 per 100 woman-years at risk. (Under conditions of perfect adherence, the pregnancy rate would be 0.5–1 per 100 woman-years.) Contraceptive failure has been observed in some patients when one or more doses are missed, if phenytoin is also being used (which may increase catabolism of the compounds), or if antibiotics are taken that alter enterohepatic cycling of metabolites.
Document 5 (Title: Toxic epidermal necrolysis in Stevens--Johnson syndrome.): Three cases are described in which Stevens-Johnson syndrome progressed in the course of a few days to toxic epidermal necrolysis. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, allopurinol in combination with hydrochlorothiazide, phenytoin and possibly ampicillin were implicated in the causation of the disease.
