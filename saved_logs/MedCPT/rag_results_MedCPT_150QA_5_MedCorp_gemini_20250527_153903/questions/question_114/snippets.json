They may reveal hyperthyroidism (high T3 and T4), hypothyroidism (low T3, T4), or subclinical hyperthyroidism (normal T3 and T4 with a low TSH).",

        "content": "Use of sensitive assays for TSH in the follow-up of patients treated with radioiodine (131I) for thyrotoxicosis has led to questions regarding the significance of abnormal TSH values found in association with normal circulating thyroid hormone levels, especially TSH results below normal. We have investigated the relationship between serum TSH and the likelihood of maintenance of euthyroidism, as well as the relationship between serum TSH and free T4, in 389 subjects treated with 131I 2-35 years previously who had free T4 and free T3 values within the normal range and who were not receiving thyroxine or antithyroid therapy. In those with undetectable TSH (less than 0.05 mU/L), TSH remained undetectable in 54.5% at 1 yr but rose to detectable or normal values in the remainder. In those with low but measurable TSH (0.05-0.5 mU/L), results were similar at 1 yr in 47.5% and returned to normal in 45%. No patient with a TSH value below normal became hypothyroid (defined as a reduction in serum free T4). In those with normal TSH (0.5-5.0 mU/L) at time 0, TSH remained normal in 83%, fell in 4% and became elevated in 13%. The yr 1 incidence of hypothyroidism was 1%; one patient became thyrotoxic. In those with TSH values above normal (5.0-15.0 mU/L), TSH remained elevated in 90.6%; the incidence of hypothyroidism was 14.5% in yr 1. The small risk of development of hypothyroidism in those with subnormal or normal TSH indicates that biochemical testing is not essential for 1-2 yr in such patients; this contrasts with a need for repeat testing within a period not exceeding 1 yr in those with elevated TSH. The relationship between serum-free T4 and TSH suggests that TSH results outside the normal range reflect thyroid hormone excess or deficiency. Persistence of undetectable TSH values during follow-up and the observation of higher free T4 at time 0 in those whose TSH remained undetectable compared with those whose TSH rose suggest that undetectable TSH concentrations are of greater significance than low but detectable values.",

        "content": "Studies were performed on 40 patients with severe primary hypothyroidism, during treatment with varying doses of T4. Therapy was initiated with 50 mug/day and was continued for at least 2 months. Subsequent repeated increases of 25 mug/day were continued for at least 2 months until the serum TSH level was less than 10 muU/ml. Measurements of serum T4 and T3, RT3U, and serum TSH were carried out at monthly intervals. TRH tests were performed after TSH levels of less than 10 muU/ml had been attained and the dose of T4 had been maintained for at least 2 months. In most of the samples obtained during treatment with various doses of T4 (50-175 mug/day), serum T4 concentrations were within the normal range, even when patients were receiving only 50 mug/day of T4; however, approximately 60% of the samples had subnormal T3 concentrations. Fifty per cent of the samples had elevated TSH concentrations despite normal T4 levels, while only 7% of the samples with normal T3, as well as T4, levels had slightly elevated TSH concentrations. Similar relationships were observed between serum TSH and free T4 indices and free T3 indices. Among patients with serum TSH levels of less than 10 muU/ml, none showed subnormal T4 concentrations, while subnormal T3 concentrations were found in some of them. Hyper-response to TRH was noted in patients with subnormal T3 levels, and normal responses were observed in patients with normal T3 and T4 concentrations. These data indicate that, during the treatment of hypothyroidism with T4, 1) normal basal TSH correlates better with normal serum T4 and T3 than with normal T4 alone, 2) the response of TSH to TRH is supranormal in patients with subnormal T3 levels, in spite of normal basal TSH and T4, and 3) the calculated maintenance dose of T4, which is associated with a normal TRH response, is 2.08 mug/day/kg of body weight.",
