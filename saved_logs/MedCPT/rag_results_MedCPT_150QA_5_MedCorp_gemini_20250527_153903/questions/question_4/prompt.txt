With your own knowledge and the help of the following document:

Document 1 (Title: [Treatment of pulmonary thromboembolism with extrinsic plasminogen activator. A case report].): A 49 year-old woman with acute pulmonary thromboembolism and severe hemodynamic impairment was successfully treated with tissue-type plasminogen activator (r-TPA). She did not have previous pulmonary or cardiac diseases. Thirty days after immobilization of the right ankle, she had a sudden onset of dyspnea, epigastrial pain and syncope. As heparin therapy was unsuccessful, 90 mg of IV r-TPA was administered. There was rapid clinical and hemodynamic improvement of her condition. Pulmonary scanning one week later was normal and she was discharged without symptoms 12 days after the acute episode.
Document 2 (Title: Case Study: 60-Year-Old Female Presenting With Shortness of Breath (Archived) -- Case Presentation): The patient is a 60-year-old white female presenting to the emergency department with acute onset shortness of breath.  Symptoms began approximately 2 days before and had progressively worsened with no associated, aggravating, or relieving factors noted. She had similar symptoms approximately 1 year ago with an acute, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation requiring hospitalization. She uses BiPAP ventilatory support at night when sleeping and has requested to use this in the emergency department due to shortness of breath and wanting to sleep. She denies fever, chills, cough, wheezing, sputum production, chest pain, palpitations, pressure, abdominal pain, abdominal distension, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.
Document 3 (Title: Pulmonary edema): Pulmonary edema (PE), also known as pulmonary congestion, is liquid accumulation in the tissue and air spaces of the lungs. It leads to impaired gas exchange and may cause respiratory failure. It is due to either failure of the left ventricle of the heart to remove blood adequately from the pulmonary circulation (cardiogenic pulmonary edema), or an injury to the lung tissue or blood vessels of the lung (non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema). Treatment is focused on three aspects: firstly improving respiratory function, secondly, treating the underlying cause, and thirdly avoiding further damage to the lung. Pulmonary edema, especially when sudden (acute), can lead to respiratory failure or cardiac arrest due to hypoxia. It is a cardinal feature of congestive heart failure. The term edema is from the Greek (oidēma, "swelling"), from οἰδέω (oidéō, "(I) swell").
Document 4 (Title: Pathoma_Husain): 1. Presents with shortness of breath, hemoptysis, pleuritic chest pain, and pleural effusion 2. V/Q lung scan shows mismatch; perfusion is abnormal. 3. Spiral CT shows a vascular filling defect in the lung. 4. Lower extremity Doppler ultrasound is useful to detect DVT. 5. D-dimer is elevated. 6. Gross examination reveals a hemorrhagic, wedge-shaped infarct. D. Sudden death occurs with a large saddle embolus that blocks both left and right pulmonary arteries or with significant occlusion of a large pulmonary artery (Fig. 4.5); death is due to electromechanical dissociation. E. Pulmonary hypertension may arise with chronic emboli that are reorganized over time. III. SYSTEMIC EMBOLISM A. Usually due to thromboembolus B. Most commonly arise in the left heart C. Travel down systemic circulation to occlude flow to organs, most commonly the lower extremities Fig. 4.5 Saddle em bolus involving pulmonary artery. (Courtesy of Yale Rosen, MD) I. BASIC PRINCIPLES
Document 5 (Title: Pulmonary hypertension): Treatment Treatment of pulmonary hypertension is determined by whether the PH is arterial, venous, hypoxic, thromboembolic, or miscellaneous. If it is caused by left heart disease, the treatment is to optimize left ventricular function by the use of medication or to repair/replace the mitral valve or aortic valve. Patients with left heart failure or hypoxemic lung diseases (groups II or III pulmonary hypertension) should not routinely be treated with vasoactive agents including prostanoids, phosphodiesterase inhibitors, or endothelin antagonists, as these are approved for the different condition called primary pulmonary arterial hypertension. To make the distinction, doctors at a minimum will conduct cardiac catheterization of the right heart, echocardiography, chest CT, a six-minute walk test, and pulmonary function testing. Using treatments for other kinds of pulmonary hypertension in patients with these conditions can harm the patient and wastes substantial medical resources.

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
Question: A pulmonary autopsy specimen from a 58-year-old woman who died of acute hypoxic respiratory failure was examined. She had recently undergone surgery for a fractured femur 3 months ago. Initial hospital course was uncomplicated, and she was discharged to a rehab facility in good health. Shortly after discharge home from rehab, she developed sudden shortness of breath and had cardiac arrest. Resuscitation was unsuccessful. On histological examination of lung tissue, fibrous connective tissue around the lumen of the pulmonary artery is observed. Which of the following is the most likely pathogenesis for the present findings?
Options:
A. Thromboembolism
B. Pulmonary ischemia
C. Pulmonary hypertension
D. Pulmonary passive congestion
