Document 1 (Title: Cardiac stress test): Absolute contraindications to cardiac stress test include: Acute myocardial infarction within 48 hours Unstable angina not yet stabilized with medical therapy Uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, which may have significant hemodynamic responses (e.g. ventricular tachycardia) Severe symptomatic aortic stenosis, aortic dissection, pulmonary embolism, and pericarditis Multivessel coronary artery diseases that have a high risk of producing an acute myocardial infarction Decompensated or inadequately controlled congestive heart failure Uncontrolled hypertension (blood pressure>200/110mm Hg) Severe pulmonary hypertension Acute aortic dissection Acutely ill for any reason Indications for termination: A cardiac stress test should be terminated before completion under the following circumstances:
Document 2 (Title: Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation -- Treatment / Management -- Rate Control): Rate control is the preferred strategy for all asymptomatic AF patients. Guidelines on target heart rate in patients selected for rate control are lacking. A previously conducted randomized trial (RACE II) to assess heart rate goal in patients with AF showed no outcome difference between lenient and strict heart rate control; however, sufficient evidence to assess the impact on all-cause mortality was lacking. Physicians usually attempt to control heart rate control with agents such as beta-blockers (metoprolol, esmolol, propranolol), nondihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers (verapamil, diltiazem), or digoxin. All 3 classes of drugs are given intravenously (IV) for acute rate control and can be switched to oral therapy for chronic management. In patients with chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, carvedilol therapy has shown significant improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction. Due to the negative inotropic properties of calcium channel blockers, physicians do not use these not preferred in such patients. Digoxin is usually reserved for patients who do not achieve rate control with beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers alone. Amiodarone can be used as second-line therapy when treatment with other agents has failed. [23] In patients refractory to medical therapy, AV node ablation with a permanent pacemaker placement can effectively control and regularize ventricular heart rate. Low doses of magnesium have shown synergistic effects on rate control.

Document 3 (Title: [Beta blocking agents in the treatment of dilated cardiomyopathy: review of the literature and clinical experience with 67 patients].): Several reports suggest that chronic beta blockade, most often with the beta 1 selective agent metoprolol, may improve hemodynamic and clinical function in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. However, controlled trials are limited and some studies have not shown beneficial effects in short term trials. Mechanisms of effectiveness are still debated and probably concern the capacity to avoid toxic myocardial damage by catecholamines, to induce receptor up-regulation, to contribute to the control of arrhythmias, to improve diastolic relaxation and other mechanisms. After a revision of the literature, a preliminary clinical experience with metoprolol in dilated cardiomyopathy diagnosed according to the WHO definition is reported. Sixty-seven patients symptomatic for congestive heart failure or with complex ventricular arrhythmias associated with severe left ventricular dysfunction were submitted to test dose with metoprolol 5 mg bid for 2-7 days. All patients were completely studied, including coronary angiography and endomyocardial biopsy to exclude ischemic heart disease and active myocarditis. Four pts (6%) did not tolerate the first test dosage of metoprolol and twenty-two patients were excluded from analysis because of inadequate follow-up or because they were enrolled in an international trial. Forty-one patients underwent long-term treatment with metoprolol at a final mean dosage of 150 mg a day (range 50-200 mg) and are presently analyzed. The dosage was gradually increased during the first seven weeks. After 6 +/- 2 months and 12 +/- 2 months, 34 patients were stable or ameliorated (Group 1) and experienced an overall significant improvement of functional class (all pts in class I-II NYHA), of left and right ventricular ejection fraction (from 28 +/- 8.8% to 35.8 +/- 13.7% to 33.2 +/- 12.3% and from 38.6 +/- 11.8% to 42.4 +/- 5.8% to 45.2 +/- 12.2% respectively), of clinical signs of congestive heart failure, of cardiothoracic index, of left ventricular diameters and of arrhythmic pattern. Furthermore, the rate of ventricular couplets &gt; 20/24h and of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia changed respectively from 46% and 54% to 4% and 21% at 12 +/- 2 months. None in Group 1 died nor is any waiting for heart transplantation. Eleven patients (Group 2) did not tolerate the drug acutely (4 pts) or deteriorated during the first 6 +/- 2 months (7 pts) of the treatment. In this group a worsening or an insignificant variation of all clinical and instrumental parameters was observed. During follow-up four patients of this group underwent heart transplantation (one died shortly after the operation because of infective complications), one died while waiting, two are currently waiting for heart transplantation, and three are still in heart failure (class III NYHA). No cases of sudden death occurred in any group of patients (15 pts with follow-up &gt; 12 mo). Our uncontrolled study seems to confirm the beneficial effect of betablockers in a subgroup of patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. The characterization of responders to this therapy is still undefined and will constitute the aim of future analyses.
Document 4 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): A 69-year-old retired teacher presents with a 1-month history of palpitations, intermittent shortness of breath, and fatigue. She has a history of hypertension. An electrocardiogram (ECG) shows atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response of 122 beats/min (bpm) and signs of left ventricular hypertrophy. She is anticoagulated with warfarin and started on sustained-release metoprolol, 50 mg/d. After 7 days, her rhythm reverts to normal sinus rhythm spontaneously. However, over the ensuing month, she continues to have intermittent palpita-tions and fatigue. Continuous ECG recording over a 48-hour period documents paroxysms of atrial fibrillation with heart rates of 88–114 bpm. An echocardiogram shows a left ven-tricular ejection fraction of 38% (normal ≥ 60%) with no localized wall motion abnormality. At this stage, would you initiate treatment with an antiarrhythmic drug to maintain normal sinus rhythm, and if so, what drug would you choose?
Document 5 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): Irbesartan Generic,Avapro Treatment of Angina Pectoris Bertram G. Katzung, MD, PhD* A 56-year-old woman presents in the office with a history of recent-onset chest discomfort when jogging or swimming vigorously. The pain is dull but poorly localized; it disap-pears after 5–10 minutes of rest. She has never smoked but has a history of hyperlipidemia (total cholesterol level of 245 mg/dL and low-density lipoprotein [LDL] of 160 mg/dL recorded 1 year ago) and admits that she has not been fol-lowing the recommended diet. Her father survived a “heart attack” at age 55, and an uncle died of some cardiac disease at age 60. On physical examination, the patient’s blood pressure is 145/90 mm Hg, and her heart rate is 80 bpm. She is in no acute distress, and there are no other significant physical findings; an electrocardiogram is normal except for slight left ventricular hypertrophy. Assuming that a diagno-sis of stable effort angina is correct, what medical treatment should be implemented?

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
Question: A 62-year-old woman presents for a regular check-up. She complains of lightheadedness and palpitations which occur episodically. Past medical history is significant for a myocardial infarction 6 months ago and NYHA class II chronic heart failure. She also was diagnosed with grade I arterial hypertension 4 years ago. Current medications are aspirin 81 mg, atorvastatin 10 mg, enalapril 10 mg, and metoprolol 200 mg daily. Her vital signs are a blood pressure of 135/90 mm Hg, a heart rate of 125/min, a respiratory rate of 14/min, and a temperature of 36.5°C (97.7°F). Cardiopulmonary examination is significant for irregular heart rhythm and decreased S1 intensity. ECG is obtained and is shown in the picture (see image). Echocardiography shows a left ventricular ejection fraction of 39%. Which of the following drugs is the best choice for rate control in this patient?
Options:
A. Atenolol
B. Diltiazem
C. Propafenone
D. Digoxin
