With your own knowledge and the help of the following document:

Document 1 (Title: Gynecology_Novak): of women undergoing IVF, the women who received acupuncture had increased cortisol levels and increased prolactin levels when compared to the controls, trending toward more normal cycle dynamics (63). More studies are needed both in the efficacy of acupuncture and infertility and in the mechanisms of action. Clinically speaking, there is provocative evidence that acupuncture appears safe in early pregnancy and is reasonable to support if patients are interested.
Document 2 (Title: Acupuncture -- Clinical Significance -- Conditions): A thorough Pubmed review will reveal a plethora of studies on the use of acupuncture with many medical conditions and diseases. However, the vast majority have not shown sufficient evidence of efficacy. The requirements outlined above have been examined most closely in regards to the effectiveness of acupuncture.
Document 3 (Title: [Acupuncture in the combined treatment of patients with unilateral paralysis of the recurrent laryngeal nerve].): Fourteen patients with unilateral paralysis of the recurrent laryngeal nerve underwent a combined therapy which included acupuncture, phonopedics, respiratory muscle gymnastics, prozerin administration by means of sinusoidal modulated currents, and intramuscular injection of B1 and B6 vitamins. Before and after treatment the vocal function was assessed using indirect laryngoscopy, laryngostroboscopy, larynx tomography and thermography, larynx endophotography, voice tape recording, and maximum phonation time measurement. The combined treatment yielded good results in all patients in terms of the recovery of their vocal function. In 11 patients the recovery was reached within 2-3 weeks and in 3 remaining patients within 2-3 months. It is maintained that the recovery was expedited due to the beneficial effect of acupuncture and phonopedics.
Document 4 (Title: Acupuncture): Efficacy Acupuncture has been researched extensively; as of 2013, there were almost 1,500 randomized controlled trials on PubMed with "acupuncture" in the title. The results of reviews of acupuncture's efficacy, however, have been inconclusive. In January 2020, David Gorski analyzed a 2020 review of systematic reviews ("Acupuncture for the Relief of Chronic Pain: A Synthesis of Systematic Reviews") concerning the use of acupuncture to treat chronic pain. Writing in Science-Based Medicine, Gorski said that its findings highlight the conclusion that acupuncture is "a theatrical placebo whose real history has been retconned beyond recognition." He also said this review "reveals the many weaknesses in the design of acupuncture clinical trials".
Document 5 (Title: Acupuncture in bronchial asthma.): By now, there is adequate clinical experience of treating bronchial asthma with acupuncture. It has a limited role in treating acute attacks since it is a weak bronchodilator, but it has an excellent prophylactic effect in the long run. Controlled trials have shown that acupuncture causes modest improvement in objective parameters, with significant subjective improvement. However, in all these trials there is a large degree of variation in the technique and methodology used. It is expected that with standardization of the technique as per the guidelines given, future trials will be able to quantify the efficacy of acupuncture in bronchial asthma. In addition, investigation of the mechanism by which acupuncture works may lead to better understanding of the pathophysiology of asthma.
