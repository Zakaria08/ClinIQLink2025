        "content": "The authors report the clinical, biochemical, histological and etiologic characteristics of 24 patients with the syndrome of benign intra-hepatic post-operative cholestasis. Jaundice appeared early in the post-operative period, from the first to the 12th post-operative day. All patients had received blood transfusions. In 23 patients, the post-operative course was complicated, chiefly by local infection or septicemia. Hyperbilirubinemia ranged from 2 to 28 mg per 100 ml and was mainly conjugated; serum alkaline phosphatase activity was normal or moderately elevated; in 3 patients, it was markedly elevated; serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase activity was normal on 7 patients, moderatly increased in 15, and markedly increased in one. Liver histology was normal in 6 patients, and showed minimal lesions (cholestasis and slight portal inflammatory changes) in 3. Jaundice did not appear to modify the final outcome. It appears to be due both to increased production of bilirubin (as a result of blood transfusions) and to decreased excretion of bilirubin by the liver (as a result of the surgical operation and of infection).",

        "content": "The provider should order a white blood cell count, hemoglobin/hematocrit, platelet count, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase. In a patient with cholelithiasis, total bilirubin of greater than 3 mg/dL to 4 mg/dL, is strongly associated with choledocholithiasis. Gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase is also elevated. Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) concentrations are elevated in biliary obstruction in a cholestatic pattern, with increases in alkaline phosphatase, serum bilirubin, and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) exceeding the elevations in serum AST and ALT. The positive predictive value of elevated liver tests is poor because liver tests are elevated due to a variety of other etiologies too. Thus, normal levels help in excluding choledocholithiasis. Symptom resolution, coupled with down-trending liver function tests, suggests that a patient has spontaneously passed the gallstone. A lipase should also be checked to assess for gallstone pancreatitis. An INR with prothrombin time can be ordered to assess the intrinsic liver function as well.",

Patients without observed liver cirrhosis compared to the control group had elevated levels of ALP (alkaline phosphatase) and GGT (gamma-glutamyl transferase). There was no significant difference in serum bile acid concentrations between patients and control group. However, test patients had lower values for total protein, CRP, albumin and creatinine. Moreover, the value for fibrinogen was higher in patients with Aagenaes syndrome.
