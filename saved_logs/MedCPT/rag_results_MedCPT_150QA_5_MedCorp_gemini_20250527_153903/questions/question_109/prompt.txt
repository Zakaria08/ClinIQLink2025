With your own knowledge and the help of the following document:

Document 1 (Title: Isosorbide -- Indications -- FDA Approved Indications for Isosorbide Dinitrate): Prevention or treatment of angina pectoris resulting from coronary artery disease - however, it is not recommended for use once the anginal episode has started because the onset of action is not sufficiently rapid enough to abort an acute anginal event. In the latter case, glyceryl trinitrate is preferable. Treatment of congestive heart failure. A fixed-dose combination of isosorbide dinitrate and hydralazine is approved to treat congestive heart failure in African Americans. [2]
Document 2 (Title: Antianginal and anti-ischemic efficacy of nicorandil compared with nifedipine in patients with angina pectoris and coronary heart disease: a double-blind, randomized, multicenter study.): Patients with stable, effort-induced angina pectoris and a typical combination of anginal pain and ischemic ST depression in exercise tolerance tests were randomized to treatment for 8 weeks with nicorandil (a newly developed antianginal and anti-ischemic drug) or nifedipine. After 4 weeks, the dosage of nicorandil was increased from 10 mg b.i.d. to 20 mg b.i.d., but the recommended dosage of nifedipine, 20 mg b.i.d., was kept constant during the study period. Double-blind treatment was preceded by a 2-week prephase during which patients were treated with isosorbide dinitrate. During the study period, patients were asked to report the rate of anginal attacks and consumption of sublingual nitroglycerin. Measurements of blood pressure and heart rate at rest and during exercise always were performed 2 h after drug intake. Fifty-eight patients were randomized--29 to nicorandil and 29 to nifedipine. There were large individual variations in anginal attack rates, which makes group comparisons difficult, but in the nicorandil group, the anginal attack rate decreased significantly compared with baseline frequency. Systolic blood pressure at rest was reduced significantly only with the highest dose of nicorandil, but nifedipine had a significant effect on both systolic and diastolic blood pressures as well as on the heart rate. Both treatments significantly increased exercise duration, time to onset of angina pectoris, and time to 1-mm ST depression. In the nicorandil group, an improvement was noted with the 20-mg dose compared with the 10-mg dose, but no significant differences were noted between the nicorandil and nifedipine groups after either 4 or 8 weeks of treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Document 3 (Title: Variant angina): As maintenance therapy, sublingual nitroglycerin tablets can be taken 3-5 min before conducting activity that causes angina by the small percentage of patients who experience angina infrequently and only when doing such activity. For most afflicted individuals, antianginals are used as maintenance therapy to avoid attacks of variant angina. Calcium channel blockers of the dihydropyridine class (e.g. nifedipine, amlodipine) or non-dihydropyridine class (e.g. verapamil, diltiazem) are regarded as first-line drugs to avoid angina attacks. Long-acting nitroglycerins such as isosorbide dinitrate or intermittent use of short-acting nitroglycerin (to treat acute symptoms) may be added to the calcium channel blocker regimen in individuals responding sub-optimally to the channel blockers. However, individuals commonly develop tolerance, i.e. resistance, to the efficacy of continuously used long-acting nitroglycerin formulations. One strategy to avoid this development is to schedule
Document 4 (Title: Biochemistry_Lippinco): .5. A 67-year-old man presented to the emergency department with a 1-week history of angina and shortness of breath. He complained that his face and extremities had taken on a blue color. His medical history included chronic stable angina treated with isosorbide dinitrate and nitroglycerin. Blood obtained for analysis was brown. Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis? A. Carboxyhemoglobinemia B. Hemoglobin SC disease C. Methemoglobinemia D. Sickle cell anemia E. β-Thalassemia
Document 5 (Title: Role of nitrates in angina pectoris.): Nitrates are used extensively for the treatment of angina pectoris. However, continuous therapy with either oral nitrates or nitroglycerin patches leads to rapid development of tolerance, with loss or diminution of antianginal and anti-ischemic effects. The only practical way to avoid the development of tolerance is to use intermittent daily therapy with nitrates. Nitroglycerin patches applied for 10-12 hours during the day increase exercise duration for 8-12 hours, but a rebound increase in anginal attacks during the nitrate-free interval may occur. Oral isosorbide-5-mononitrate, 20 mg twice a day, with the first dose administered in the morning and the second dose 7 hours later, increases exercise duration for at least 12 hours without the development of tolerance to either the morning or afternoon dose. This dosing regimen has been shown not to produce a rebound phenomenon during the periods of low nitrate levels at night and early hours of the morning. Isosorbide dinitrate (30 mg) prescribed at 7 AM and 1 PM does not produce tolerance to the 7 AM dose, but effects of the afternoon dose have not been evaluated. Recent data suggest that isosorbide dinitrate given 3 or 4 times daily produces tolerance and this dosing schedule is inadequate for antianginal prophylaxis. It should be recognized that intermittent oral or patch therapy with nitrates during the day leaves the patient unprotected at night and early hours of the morning. If this is of concern, additional therapy with another class of antianginal agent, preferably a long-acting beta blocker or a long-acting calcium antagonist should be instituted.
