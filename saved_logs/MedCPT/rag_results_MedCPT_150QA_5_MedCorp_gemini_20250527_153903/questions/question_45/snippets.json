        "content": "A retrospective analysis of 206 cases of thyroid carcinoma treated at a single surgical service in a region with endemic goitre is presented. In contrast to the marked female preponderance in surgically treated benign thyroid disorders, the frequency of thyroid carcinoma was almost equal in the two sexes (males/females = 100/106). The duration of symptoms was, as a rule, short and there was a predominance of advanced lesions (T3N3M1) even among the well-differentiated tumours. Papillary carcinoma was the most common histologic type (45%) but its proportion was considerably lower than usually reported from non-endemic regions. The average TSH level was significantly elevated in the carcinoma group and associated adenomatous changes were found in 40/100 cases which might suggest an etiologic role of increased TSH stimulation. Since most thyroid carcinomas had a very malignant clinical behaviour, surgical treatment aimed at near-total thyroidectomy which was performed in 62% of the cases. During a follow-up of up to eleven years recurrence in the remaining contralateral lobe occurred in 23% of patients with hemithyroidectomy and loco-regional recurrence was seen in 29% of patients with near-total thyroidectomy. Mortality was high in all histologic types, further underlining the aggressive biologic behaviour of thyroid cancers in an endemic area.",

        "content": "This paper reports the results and experiences of 95 cases with differentiated thyroid carcinoma managed by surgical treatment. Eighty-two patients were followed up with an average time of 6.2 years, the longest was fifteen years and six months, 96% of patients were survival over 5 years. The factors influencing prognosis are as follows: 1. Age: Elder predicts worse prognosis. 2. Papillary is better then follicular. 3. The stage of thyroid carcinoma: Bigger mass, tumor cells spreading out of thyroid capsule with invasion of adjacent tissues and regional lymph nodes, and intravascular tumor cell embolus almost always shows higher recurrence and mortality. 4. Simple tumor removal before admission gives no reasonable cure, but increasing risk of spreading as showed in our cases. Therefore, we emphasize that thyroid carcinoma should be treated primarily with radical operation. By our experience thyroid carcinoma should be treated with lobectomy for affected site, excision of isthmus, and contralateral subtotal thyroidectomy. Because of the low grade malignancy in differentiated thyroid carcinoma, modified neck dissection is the surgical procedure of choice. Patients undergoing such surgical procedure as stated above can be prevented from sequelae.",
