Topical agents such as microfibrillar collagen are available in 5-mm and 10-mm diameter laparoscopic applicators (Fig. 23.13). Fibrin sealants (e.g., Tisseel\u00ae) and bovine thrombin and gelatin (Floseal\u00ae)can also be used. A solution of dilute vasopressin may be injected locally to maintain hemostasis for myomectomy or removal of ectopic pregnancy.",

        "content": "Therapy of entamebiasis is critical in that, if untreated, the disease can be fatal. Recently, a new method for differentiating pathogenic and non-pathogenic amebae has been standardized. This method relies upon the electrophoretic analysis of 4 isoenzymes which allow the identification of 20 different zymodemes. It is now widely accepted that non-pathogenic strains of Entamoeba histolytica are not a hazard for humans and therefore don't need therapy. As a consequence, treatment must be addressed only toward infections caused by pathogenic strains. As there are different drugs available for treating amebiasis, from a therapeutical point of view the disease must be divided into two forms: intestinal and extraintestinal. For the former, drugs which reach therapeutical levels in the gut are required. The mainstay for the treatment of asymptomatic carriage of pathogenic strains is DILOXANIDE FUROATE, a very well tolerated luminal amebicide. METRONIDAZOLE and other 5-nitroimidazole compounds such as ORNIDAZOLE are indicated for the treatment of symptomatic intestinal infections as they reach good concentrations in tissues, including the bowel where ulcerations develop. In order to ensure the clearance of amebae from the gut, a subsequent cycle with diloxanide furoate is advisable. Extraintestinal forms include amebic abscesses which can develop in many sites, but most commonly in the liver. Metronidazole and related compounds are the drugs of choice; in case of liver abscess, the addition of CHLOROQUINE is indicated because of its good concentration in tissues. A subsequent cycle with diloxanide furoate is also indicated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "content": "Since 1961, when Cosar pointed out for the first time that metronidazol was a useful pharmacological agent against E. histolytica, several authors have demonstrated its effectiveness against invasive amebiasis in its colonic or extraintestinal variety. The obtained results with metronidazol were so far better compared with the rest of the known amebecides, that in 1974, Elsdon Dew stated that a new era in the medical treatment of the amebiasis had started with the forthcoming use of the agent. However, the frequent and important adverse collateral effects produced in a good number of patients have forced to look for other nitroimidazole derivates, hopefully more efficient and, of course, better tolerated. Thus, the tinidazole, ornidazole, flunidazole, romidazole, ornidazole, flunidazole, dimetridazole, satranidazole, nitrimidazine, panidazole, have been tried and some others are still subject to experimentation, such as the Ro 7-0207 (alpha-chlorometil-2-metil-5-nitro-1-imidazol), the phexinidazole (HOE 239) and the CG 10213-Go from CIBA-Geigy and no significant advantage has been found over the metronidazol. The phexinidazole turned out to be twice as effective as the metronidazole in the experimental hepatic amebiasis of the golden hamster. This fact must be confirmed or discarded in the human hepatic amebiasis.",
