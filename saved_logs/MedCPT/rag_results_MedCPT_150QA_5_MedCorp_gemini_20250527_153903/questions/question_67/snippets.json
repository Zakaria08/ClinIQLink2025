        "content": "Any experiment based on withholding vaccines from children is considered unethical, and observational studies would likely be confounded by differences in the healthcare-seeking behaviors of under-vaccinated children. Thus, no study directly comparing rates of autism in vaccinated and unvaccinated children has been done. However, the concept of vaccine overload is biologically implausible, as vaccinated and unvaccinated children have the same immune response to non-vaccine-related infections, and autism is not an immune-mediated disease, so claims that vaccines could cause it by overloading the immune system go against current knowledge of the pathogenesis of autism. As such, the idea that vaccines cause autism has been effectively dismissed by the weight of current evidence.",

        "content": "This study assesses the level of knowledge about and attitudes toward AIDS among youth residing in residential centers. It also assesses the degree to which they engage in high risk behaviors related to AIDS. The study evaluates the impact of a short educational intervention on the youth's knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to AIDS. Findings suggest that the respondents are relatively knowledgeable about the disease and how to prevent it. However, a substantial proportion of them do not hold positive attitudes toward prevention and are actually engaging in unsafe behavior. The results also show that a short intervention that provides information about AIDS is ineffective in reducing engagement in high risk activities.",

        "content": "AIDS in the Republic of Ireland has so far mainly been associated with intravenous drug use. However, because of growing public pressure to mount an AIDS campaign aimed at potentially vulnerable sub-groups, we conducted a survey of knowledge and attitudes related to AIDS among 891 Irish schoolchildren in the senior years of secondary school. Although virtually none of the children had received any classroom education on AIDS and no national education programme had been undertaken at the time of the survey, levels of knowledge were high among the pupils studied, and compared favourably with levels found using the same questionnaire among San Franciscan pupils. Higher levels of knowledge were found among urban pupils and, although some sex differences in knowledge emerged, there was no consistent pattern in these. No school surveyed showed sufficient misinformation to warrant a systematic education programme.",
