With your own knowledge and the help of the following document:

Document 1 (Title: Thyroglossal Duct Cyst -- History and Physical): Thyroglossal duct cysts typically present as mobile midline neck masses near the hyoid bone. They often are asymptomatic. However, they can present as an abscess or intermittently draining sinus. The mass will elevate with tongue protrusion or swallowing. The mass is closely associated with the hyoid bone and most commonly found at or below the level of the hyoid.
Document 2 (Title: [Cysts of the thyroglossal duct: analysis of diagnostic errors and causes of recurrence].): Thyroglossal-duct cysts usually present as an anterior midline neck mass, ranking first in this location in the pediatric age. We have carried out a retrospective revision of 52 pediatric patients with a preoperative diagnosis of thyroglossal-duct cyst. All of them were treated in our surgical unit between 1982 and 1989. The male to female ratio of cases was 34:18 with symptoms appearing at an average age of 4 years. The most frequent clinical presentation was that of a cystic mass without any inflammatory signs (65%), located in the mid-line at the hyoid level (75%). In this paper we analyze the existing possibilities as regards to the clinical presentation, location and characteristics of this type of cervical swellings, as well as the most frequent causes of misdiagnosis. We also make a comparison between the results we have obtained with the different surgical techniques used. We conclude that it is necessary to perform a radical surgical treatment of the thyroglossal-duct remnants, which includes removal of the middle third of the hyoid bone and excision of the thyroglossal duct as far as the foramen cecum.
Document 3 (Title: Persistent thyroglossal duct): Three-fourths of abnormalities within a persistent thyroglossal duct involve the formation of a cyst. If a persistent thyroglossal duct becomes fluid filled it will form a thyroglossal duct cyst, which accounts for 70% of congenital neck masses and is the most likely diagnosis if the mass is along the midline of the neck. These cysts are often diagnosed in children under the age of ten and have no particular gender prevalence. The cysts are normally asymptomatic at this age and are noticed because of the swelling that will move if the patient swallows. Over 80% of these cysts are located at or below the hyoid bone.
Document 4 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): the arms are raised (Pemberton’s sign). With any central mass above the thyroid, the tongue should be extended, as thyroglossal cysts then move upward. The thyroid examination is not complete without assessment for lymphadenopathy in the supraclavicular and cervical regions of the neck.
Document 5 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): gland buds off the foregut diverticulum at the base of the tongue in the region of the future foramen cecum at 3 weeks of embryonic life. As the fetal neck develops, the thyroid tissue becomes more anterior and caudad until it rests in its normal position. The “descent” of the thyroid is intimately connected with the development of the hyoid bone. Residual thyroid tis-sue left behind during the migration may persist and subse-quently present in the midline of the neck as a thyroglossal duct cyst. The mass is most commonly appreciated in the 2to 4-year-old child when the baby fat disappears and irregulari-ties in the neck become more readily apparent. Usually the cyst is encountered in the midline at or below the level of the hyoid bone and moves up and down with swallowing or with protrusion of the tongue. Occasionally it presents as an intrathyroidal mass. Most thyroglossal duct cysts are asymp-tomatic. If the duct retains its connection with the pharynx, infection may occur, and the

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
Question: A 13-year-old girl presents to a medical office for the evaluation of a lump on the front of her neck. The patient denies pain, but states that the mass bothers her because “it moves when I swallow”. The physical examination reveals a midline neck mass that is above the hyoid bone but below the level of the mandible. The mass is minimally mobile and feels fluctuant without erythema. The patient is afebrile and all vital signs are stable. A complete blood count and thyroid function tests are performed and are within normal limits. What is the most likely cause of this patient’s presentation?
Options:
A. Persistent thyroid tissue at the tongue base
B. Deletion of the 22q11 gene
C. Cyst formation in a persistent thyroglossal duct
D. Lymph node enlargement
