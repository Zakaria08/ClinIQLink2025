        "title": "Clinical features and outcome in 68 cases of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage without aneurysm repair--a community hospital study.",
        "content": "The authors studied the clinical features and outcome at 6 months in 191 patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) from ruptured aneurysms. Aneurysm repair (AR) was undertaken in 123 cases (64.4%). In the non-AR group (n = 68), 48.5% of the patients were 70 years of age or older, compared with 12.2% in the AR group. The duration from onset to admission was less than 3 hours in 48 non-AR cases (70.6%) and in 42 AR cases (34.1%). Among non-AR patients, 63.2% were Hunt and Hess grade IV or V, whereas the figure for AR patients was only 14.7%. By 6 months after SAH, 94.1% of non-AR patients had died, and the remainder were vegetative or severely disabled. In contrast, only 15.4% in the AR group died, and over 50% showed good recovery. The large majority of non-AR patients were treated conservatively because they were judged to be poor surgical risks and, among these patients, nearly one half were elderly. In the 10 elderly patients considered good surgical candidates, vasospasm was the most common reason (70%) for not performing AR.",

        "content": "42 of 44 patients were women and most were older than 50 years of age. All of the patients reported by So and coworkers were women, ranging in age from 41 to 70 years. Cerebral ischemia may be associated with the process but the rate of this complication has not been established; our impression is that it is low. In the study by Corrin and colleagues, among 79 untreated asymptomatic patients followed for an average of 5 years, 3 had a cerebral infarct 4 to 18 years after the initial diagnosis. Also, between 7 and 20 percent of affected individuals are found to have intracranial saccular aneurysms (rarely a giant aneurysm), which may be sources of subarachnoid hemorrhage, and up to 12 percent develop arterial dissections, as described below.",

        "content": "Subarachnoid bleed If an aneurysm ruptures, blood leaks into the space around the brain. This is called a subarachnoid hemorrhage. Onset is usually sudden without prodrome, classically presenting as a \"thunderclap headache\" worse than previous headaches. Symptoms of a subarachnoid hemorrhage differ depending on the site and size of the aneurysm. Symptoms of a ruptured aneurysm can include: a sudden severe headache that can last from several hours to days nausea and vomiting drowsiness, confusion and/or loss of consciousness visual abnormalities meningism dizziness Almost all aneurysms rupture at their apex. This leads to hemorrhage in the subarachnoid space and sometimes in brain parenchyma. Minor leakage from aneurysm may precede rupture, causing warning headaches. About 60% of patients die immediately after rupture. Larger aneurysms have a greater tendency to rupture, though most ruptured aneurysms are less than 10 mm in diameter.",

        "content": "An aneurysm may be detected incidentally on brain imaging; this presents a conundrum, as all treatments for cerebral aneurysms are associated with potential complications. The International Study of Unruptured Intracranial Aneurysms (ISUIA) provided prognostic data both in people having previously had a subarachnoid hemorrhage and people who had aneurysms detected by other means. Those having previously had a SAH were more likely to bleed from other aneurysms. In contrast, those having never bled and had small aneurysms (smaller than 10 mm) were very unlikely to have a SAH and were likely to sustain harm from attempts to repair these aneurysms. On the basis of the ISUIA and other studies, it is now recommended that people are considered for preventive treatment only if they have a reasonable life expectancy and have aneurysms that are highly likely to rupture. Moreover, there is only limited evidence that endovascular treatment of unruptured aneurysms is actually beneficial.",
