Document 1 (Title: Treatment options for the pharmacological therapy of neonatal meningitis.): Neonatal bacterial meningitis has a relatively low incidence in developed countries, but continues to cause morbidity and mortality despite advances in antimicrobial therapy. Bacterial pathogens commonly associated with neonatal meningitis include Group B streptococci, Escherichia coli K1 and other coliforms, Listeria monocytogenes and staphylococci. As it can be difficult to differentiate meningitis from septicaemia in neonates, empirical antibiotic therapy should be effective for both. Selection of an empirical antibiotic regimen should be based on: (a) bacterial prevalence and susceptibility; (b) drug characteristics; (c) postnatal age at the onset of disease; and (d) patient-specific factors. A penicillin in combination with an aminoglycoside or cefotaxime is commonly used in empirical therapies. The increased risk of staphylococcal infection in older neonates requires consideration of an antistaphylococcal antibiotic in the empirical therapy regimen. Once a causative organism has been identified, antimicrobial therapy should be directed towards that pathogen. Duration of therapy remains empirical, but should be at least 7 days for documented bacterial meningitis. Viral meningitis continues to have a high mortality despite the availability of antiviral agents. Adjunctive therapies may further reduce the morbidity and mortality of meningitis. While most of these therapeutic options have not been investigated in neonates, they may prove to be of benefit in the future. Anti-inflammatory agents, such as glucocorticoids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents and immunoglobulin, may modulate the inflammatory response of a meningeal infection. Other possible therapies in neonatal meningitis include cerebral blood flow modulators and disease prevention with maternal vaccines and perinatal antibiotics. Practical aspects of drug therapy such as route of administration and serum drug concentration monitoring can improve both drug therapy and patient outcome. While antibiotics have greatly improved the treatment outcome of neonatal meningitis, it is clear that additional intervention will be required to increase cure rates and reduce sequelae.
Document 2 (Title: Nisin): Properties While in general most bacteriocins inhibit only closely related species, nisin is a rare example of a "broad-spectrum" bacteriocin effective against many Gram-positive organisms, including lactic acid bacteria (commonly associated to avoid food spoilage), Listeria monocytogenes (a known pathogen), Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium botulinum, etc. It is also particularly effective against spores. Gram-negative bacteria are protected by their outer membrane but may become susceptible to nisin action after a heat shock or when this is coupled with the chelator EDTA. When used in combination with EDTA, nisin has the ability to inhibit E. coli O157:H7 and Salmonella enterica. Nisin, as a class I bacteriocin, is very stable at acidic pHs and is more heat stable at lower pHs. The mode of action of Nisin against pathogens such as L. monocytogenes is to dissipate the membrane potential and pH gradient.
Document 3 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): In the initial regimen, it is necessary to use antibiotics active against both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria (Table 104-4). 2. Monotherapy with an aminoglycoside or an antibiotic lacking good activity against gram-positive organisms (e.g., ciprofloxacin or aztreonam) is not adequate in this setting. 3. The agents used should reflect both the epidemiology and the antibiotic resistance pattern of the hospital. 4. If the pattern of resistance justifies its use, a single third-generation cephalosporin constitutes an appropriate initial regimen in many hospitals. 5. Most standard regimens are designed for patients who have not previously received prophylactic antibiotics. The development of fever in a patient who has received antibiotics affects the choice of subsequent therapy, which should target resistant organisms and organisms known to cause infections in patients being treated with the antibiotics already administered. 6.
Document 4 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): The choice of antimicrobial agents to treat both coagulasepositive and coagulase-negative staphylococcal infections has become increasingly problematic because of the prevalence of multidrug-resistant strains. Staphylococcal resistance to most antibiotic families, including β-lactams, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, and (to a lesser extent) glycopeptides, has increased. This trend is more apparent with CoNS: >80% of nosocomial isolates are resistant to methicillin, and these methicillin-resistant strains are usually resistant to most other antibiotics as well. Because the selection of antimicrobial agents for S. aureus infections is similar to that for CoNS infections, treatment options for these pathogens are discussed together and are summarized in Table 172-3.
Document 5 (Title: Listeria Monocytogenes -- Treatment / Management): Since other causes of meningitis include gram-positive organisms such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and gram-negative organisms such as Neisseria meningitidis , Ceftriaxone is added as a treatment regimen . Gentamicin is utilized to mostly cover for gram-negative etiologies of meningitis such as Escherichia coli in the infant population. Finally, Vancomycin is added for Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus coverage. For broad coverage of bacterial meningitis in populations susceptible to L. monocytogenes , consider the following regimens: Less than one month old: Ampicillin plus gentamicin Adults with depressed cellular immunity or older than 50 years old: Vancomycin plus ceftriaxone plus ampicillin
