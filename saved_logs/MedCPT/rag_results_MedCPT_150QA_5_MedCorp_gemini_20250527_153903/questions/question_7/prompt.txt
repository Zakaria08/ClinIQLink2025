Document 1 (Title: Root Cause Analysis and Medical Error Prevention -- Function -- Case example 1): A 42-year-old primigravida woman at 34 weeks gestation was brought to the obstetric emergency department at midnight with complaints of severe headache, blurry vision, and right upper quadrant pain for the last 5 to 6 hours. She noted lower extremity edema and facial swelling that was gradually increasing. She has gestational hypertension and, 1 week ago, was prescribed labetalol 200 mg twice a day. On initial presentation, her blood pressure was 190/110 mm Hg on 2 separate occasions, 5 minutes apart. She had gained 2 kilograms since her last antenatal checkup in the clinic a week ago. The patient was diagnosed with severe preeclampsia. The senior obstetric resident ordered a loading dose of magnesium sulfate to prevent imminent seizure. The hospital protocol used an intravenous (IV) and intramuscular (IM) regimen where the patient received a 4 g IV bolus and a 10 g IM dose administered as 5 g in each buttock. The senior resident gave verbal orders for magnesium sulfate administration to the junior resident, who verbally communicated the order to the nurse.
Document 2 (Title: Prenatal care): Prenatal diagnosis or prenatal screening (note that "Prenatal Diagnosis" and "Prenatal Screening" refer to two different types of tests) is testing for diseases or conditions in a fetus or embryo before it is born. Obstetricians and midwives have the ability to monitor mother's health and prenatal development during pregnancy through series of regular check-ups. Physical examinations generally consist of: Collection of (mother's) medical history Checking (mother's) blood pressure (Mother's) height and weight Pelvic exam Doppler fetal heart rate monitoring (Mother's) blood and urine tests Discussion with caregiver
Document 3 (Title: Biochemistry_Lippinco): Patient Presentation: BE is a 45-year-old woman who presents with concerns about sudden (paroxysmal), intense, brief episodes of headache, sweating (diaphoresis), and a racing heart (palpitations). Focused History: BE reports that the attacks started ~3 weeks ago. They last from 2 to 10 minutes, during which time she feels quite anxious. During the attacks, it feels as though her heart is skipping beats (arrhythmia). At first, she thought the attacks were related to recent stress at work and maybe even menopause. The last time it happened, she was in a pharmacy and had her blood pressure taken. She was told it was 165/110 mm Hg. BE notes that she has lost weight (~8 lbs) in this period even though her appetite has been good.
Document 4 (Title: [A case of miliary tuberculosis associated with acute respiratory failure during pregnancy].): A case of miliary tuberculosis associated with acute respiratory failure during pregnancy was reported. A 39-year-old, 29-week pregnant woman was admitted to our hospital with complaints of nonproductive cough and fever on June 12. On admission, her temperature was 38.2 degrees C; pulse rate was 90/min., and blood pressure was 120/76 mmHg. Physical examination revealed moist rales at right lung basis. Chest X-ray showed small nodular infiltrates in right lower lung field. Laboratory data revealed positive CRP, accelerated ESR and increased level of alpha 2-globulin. The number of T-cells was markedly decreased (14/mm3). The PPD skin test was negative, and the sputum smears for acid-fast bacilli were negative. Suspected of bacterial or viral pneumonia, the patient was treated with antibiotics (CPM, EM and CAZ), which had no effects for her. On June 16, the Chest X-ray showed infiltrates throughout bilateral lung fields, and the patient became increasingly dyspneic. On June 18, the results of arterial blood gas, analysis under room air were: PaO2 26.7 Torr, PaCO2 29.0 Torr, pH 7.505. Because of severe hypoxemia, she was intubated and placed on a volume-cycled respirator. Hydrocortisone (1000 mg, daily) was added to treatment because ARDS was suspected. Since the smears of tracheobronchial secretions showed acid-fast bacilli on June 24, she was diagnosed to have miliary tuberculosis. Then the intensive therapy with antituberculosis drugs (isoniazid 400 mg, rifampicin 450 mg, and streptomycin 1g, daily) was started. The non specific antibiotics were discontinued; hydrocortisone was tapered and stopped. The next week, she became afebrile and hypoxemia steadily improved.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Document 5 (Title: Longitudinal chronobiologic blood pressure monitoring for assessing the need and timing of antihypertensive treatment.): To examine the need for antihypertensive therapy and its timing, a 46 year-old woman with a 10-year history of "mild to moderate hypertension," treated for that span with 50 mg of hydrochlorothiazide per day, usually taken before retiring, carried out a study in a series of stages. Throughout the first 8 stages, she monitored her blood pressure and heart rate at 15-minute intervals around the clock for 70 consecutive days. In the first two stages, her medication was continued for a total of 10 days, of which the last 7 days constituted a double-blind study start. For the next 25 days, she was placed on a placebo once in the evening. For the ensuing week, she received three tablets per day (in the morning, noon and evening), with all three being placebo. Thereafter, for consecutive 7-day spans, she was placed on treatment, only in the morning, only at noon or only in the evening, with placebo at other times. The desirability of one vs. another treatment was assessed by a comparison of slopes fitted to the daily MESORs; on that basis, the morning or noon treatment appeared to be possibly superior to the evening treatment. Eventually the patient was taken off medication; 5 months later her sphygmochrons, based on two-to-six day monitoring, were acceptable by current standards. The slope of MESORs may be a useful endpoint to assess the need for medication, to optimize its timing or to establish the likelihood that medication is not needed. This approach should, however, be based on several (rather than a single) double-blind alternation of drug and placebo treatments for spans that are the longer the smaller the extent of apparent blood pressure elevation. Thus, in the case of apparent mild MESOR-hypertension, the blood pressure MESOR changes following the change in medication should be assessed during spans longer than one week. In the particular case studied, it seems possible that the patient had taken medication for 10 years, perhaps without justification. In cases of very mild blood pressure elevation, it seems desirable, by self-measurement or preferably automatic measurement, to take the patient off medication for spans measured in weeks or preferably months rather than days, in order to rule in or rule out the need for treatment, on the basis of repeated blood pressure profiles, to be compared eventually with reference standards from peers at low familial and personal risk of developing high blood pressure.

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
Question: A 25-year-old primigravida presents to her physician for a routine prenatal visit. She is at 34 weeks gestation, as confirmed by an ultrasound examination. She has no complaints, but notes that the new shoes she bought 2 weeks ago do not fit anymore. The course of her pregnancy has been uneventful and she has been compliant with the recommended prenatal care. Her medical history is unremarkable. She has a 15-pound weight gain since the last visit 3 weeks ago. Her vital signs are as follows: blood pressure, 148/90 mm Hg; heart rate, 88/min; respiratory rate, 16/min; and temperature, 36.6℃ (97.9℉). The blood pressure on repeat assessment 4 hours later is 151/90 mm Hg. The fetal heart rate is 151/min. The physical examination is significant for 2+ pitting edema of the lower extremity. Which of the following tests o should confirm the probable condition of this patient?
Options:
A. Bilirubin assessment
B. Coagulation studies
C. Leukocyte count with differential
D. 24-hour urine protein
