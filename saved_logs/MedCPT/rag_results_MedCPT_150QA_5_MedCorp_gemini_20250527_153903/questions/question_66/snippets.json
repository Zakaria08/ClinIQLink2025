All potential donors should know there is a 0.5 to 1.0 percent chance of death. Other risks of donating a liver include bleeding, infection, painful incision, possibility of blood clots and a prolonged recovery. The vast majority of donors enjoy complete and full recovery within 2\u20133 months. Pediatric transplantation In children, living liver donor transplantation has become very accepted. The accessibility of adult parents who want to donate a piece of the liver for their children/infants has reduced the number of children who would have otherwise died waiting for a transplant. Having a parent as a donor also has made it a lot easier for children \u2013 because both patients are in the same hospital and can help boost each other's morale.",

        "content": "The LRLT procedure appears to be a promising alternative and adjunct to conventional liver transplantation. The advantages to this technique are a donor for each recipient, an improved quality of graft, and a reduction in pretransplant mortality in children. The procedure is not without risks, but the overall benefits seem to outweigh these risks, and only future experience will tell otherwise. Will there continue to be a need for such a procedure? We believe there will be, because the number of candidates needing transplantation will continue to grow and the demand for cadaveric organs will never be met. However, the procedure is extremely labor and resource intensive, and it is our belief that only a handful of large major medical centers will be able to adopt a live-donor program.",

A more viable alternative, transplantation of the right lobe of the liver from a healthy adult donor into an adult recipient, has gained increased popularity. Living donor transplantation of the left lobe (left lateral segment), introduced in the early 1990s to alleviate the extreme shortage of donor organs for small children, accounts currently for approximately one-third of all liver transplantation procedures in children. Driven by the shortage of cadaver organs, living donor transplantation involving the more sizable right lobe is being considered with increasing frequency in adults; however, living donor liver transplantation cannot be expected to solve the donor organ shortage; 246 such procedures were done in 2012, representing only about 4% of all liver transplant operations done in the United States.",
