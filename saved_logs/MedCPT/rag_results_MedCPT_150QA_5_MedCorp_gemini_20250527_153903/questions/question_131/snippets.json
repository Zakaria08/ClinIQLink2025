        "title": "Immunoglobulin D",
        "content": "Immunoglobulin D (IgD) is an antibody isotype that makes up about 1% of proteins in the plasma membranes of immature B-lymphocytes where it is usually co-expressed with another cell surface antibody called IgM. IgD is also produced in a secreted form that is found in very small amounts in blood serum, representing 0.25% of immunoglobulins in serum. The relative molecular mass and half-life of secreted IgD is 185 kDa and 2.8 days, respectively. Secreted IgD is produced as a monomeric antibody with two heavy chains of the delta (\u03b4) class, and two Ig light chains. Function The function of IgD has been a puzzle in immunology since its discovery in 1964. IgD is present in species from cartilaginous fish to human (with the possible exception of birds). This nearly ubiquitous appearance in species with an adaptive immune system demonstrates that IgD may be as ancient as IgM and suggests that IgD has important immunological functions.",

        "content": "4-1 IgG antibodies consist of four polypeptide chains. IgG antibodies are large molecules with a molecular weight of approximately 150 kDa and are composed of two different kinds of polypeptide chains. One, of approximately 50 kDa, is called the heavy or H chain, and the other, of 25 kDa, is the light or L chain (Fig. 4.2). Each IgG molecule consists of two heavy chains and two light chains. The two heavy chains are linked to each other by disulfide bonds, and each heavy chain is linked to a light chain by a disulfide bond. In any given immunoglobulin molecule, the two heavy chains and the two light chains are identical, giving an antibody molecule two identical antigen-binding sites. This gives the antibody the ability to bind simultaneously to two identical antigens on a surface, thereby increasing the total strength of the interaction, which is called its avidity. The strength of the interaction between a single antigen-binding site and its antigen is called its affinity.",

        "content": "Alternative polyadenylation site selection of the primary transcript results in substituting a short hydrophilic sequence for a transmembrane domain at the carboxy terminus, resulting in IgM secretion. Due to cysteine residues in this hydrophilic sequence at the carboxy terminus, IgM oligomerizes during the secretory pathway to form pentameric IgM connected by a J chain or as a hexamer without the J chain. [5] A single IgM molecule is similar to IgE in that it contains\u00a04 constant heavy domains and lacks a hinge region. Therefore, IgM molecules have slightly less flexibility and rotation freedom than IgG, IgA, or IgD molecules.",

Antigen-specific receptors on mammalian B-lymphocytes are mainly monomeric IgM and IgD consisting of conventional immunoglobulin heavy and light chains. The nature of the T-lymphocyte receptors which can specifically recognize antigens is not yet fully defined but it seems that conventional light chains do not participate in the build up of this receptor. However, T-lymphocytes express two polypeptide chains which bear variable domains sharing idiotypic determinants with the corresponding B-lymphocytes. These Tau chains can bind the corresponding antigen.",

        "content": "Some antibodies, like IgM, can have\u00a05 duplicates of the structure above to form a pentamer capable of binding up to ten antigens. However, IgE is a monomer composed of\u00a02 epsilon-heavy chains and\u00a02 light chains, thus capable of binding a total of\u00a02 antigens, which occurs through the variable regions of the light and heavy chains that create unique antigen-specific binding sites. The C-terminal regions of the heavy chains are composed of\u00a04 C-epsilon dimers, C-epsilon 1-4. [4] The chemical structure of these dimers is essential for binding IgE-specific cellular receptors Fc-epsilon RI and CD23, which will be discussed in more detail later. Some immunoglobulins, such as IgG, contain a \"hinge\" region near the molecule's center. IgE is unique because it lacks this hinge region and is replaced by the C-epsilon2 domain. There is a theory that the lack of this hinge region allows the IgE molecule to adopt a more flexible conformation while interacting with its receptors. Furthermore, the IgE molecule is more heavily glycosylated than\u00a0other antibodies, containing 7 N-linked glycosylations on each heavy chain, which is necessary for binding to a high-affinity cellular receptor, Fc-epsilon-RI (see Diagram.
