        "title": "[Acute poisoning with ethylene glycol esters].",
        "content": "The study was performed of 13 acute oral poisonings with ethylene glycol ethers characterized as moderate or severe and resulting in poor outcome in 3 cases. Ethyl ether was responsible for 3 poisonings, methyl ether for 10 ones. It was found, that the intoxication had four stages or periods (initial, latent, clinical, recovery) and presented with CNS impairment, gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal disorders, decompensated metabolic acidosis, etc. The paper describes two clinical cases and experimental toxicity of cellosolves as well as the effect of the inhibitor of isovaleric acid amide alcohol dehydrogenase on animal lethality. The results obtained support the suggestion of ADH-participated metabolic activation of cellosolves in the body. The prospects of further studies into intoxication pathogenesis and new opportunities for relevant poisoning management are outlined.",

        "content": "Three stages of ethylene glycol overdose occur. Within the first few hours after ingestion, there is transient excitation followed by CNS depression. After a delay of 4\u201312 hours, severe metabolic acidosis develops from accumulation of acid metabolites and lactate. Finally, deposition of oxalate crystals in renal tubules occurs, followed by delayed renal insufficiency. The key to the diagnosis of ethylene glycol poisoning is recognition of anion gap acidosis, osmolar gap, and oxalate crystals in the urine in a patient without visual symptoms.",

In 2007, United States poison centers received a combined 8014 calls related to possible ethylene glycol or methanol exposure. [11] Ethylene glycol, an essential component of antifreeze, has a bright color and sweet taste, making it particularly appealing to children. Classic signs and symptoms of ethylene glycol poisoning include altered mental state, metabolic acidosis, acute renal failure, and oxalate crystals in the urine. Hypocalcemia, multiorgan dysfunction, and even death occur in severe cases. [11] Methanol is present in embalming fluids, paint removers, windshield-washer fluid, canned-heating products, and moonshine liquor. Methanol poisoning causes profound metabolic acidosis and visual changes that may lead to blindness. Severe cases can result in multiorgan failure and death. Untreated methanol poisoning carries a mortality rate as high as 28% with permanent visual defects or blindness in up to 30% of survivors. [11]",
