        "content": "Patient Presentation: BE is a 45-year-old woman who presents with concerns about sudden (paroxysmal), intense, brief episodes of headache, sweating (diaphoresis), and a racing heart (palpitations). Focused History: BE reports that the attacks started ~3 weeks ago. They last from 2 to 10 minutes, during which time she feels quite anxious. During the attacks, it feels as though her heart is skipping beats (arrhythmia). At first, she thought the attacks were related to recent stress at work and maybe even menopause. The last time it happened, she was in a pharmacy and had her blood pressure taken. She was told it was 165/110 mm Hg. BE notes that she has lost weight (~8 lbs) in this period even though her appetite has been good.",

        "content": "The case is reported of a 49-year-old chronic alcoholic woman, who presented with severe pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) mimicking as an acute abdomen. She was admitted with right-sided hypochondrial abdominal pain and hepatomegaly, with a moderate jaundice. On admission to intensive care unit, she had an arterial blood pressure of 110/70 mmHg, a heart rate of 100 b.min-1, and a respiratory rate of 36 c.min-1. An electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm and right-sided heart failure. Whilst breathing 6 l.min-1 oxygen, her arterial blood gases were: PaO2 47 mmHg PaCO2 29 mmHg. Severe PAH was confirmed by measuring her mean pulmonary arterial pressure, which was 46 mmHg, whilst her pulmonary wedge pressure was 7 mmHg. Hepatic function was also altered: total bilirubin 41 mumol.l-1, alkaline phosphatase 145 UI.l-1 and gamma glutamyl transferase 1 340 UI.l-1. She developed arterial hypotension, which did not respond to increasing doses of isoproterenol. She died on the third day. Necropsy confirmed the diagnosis of primary PAH, with acute \"cardiac liver\".",
