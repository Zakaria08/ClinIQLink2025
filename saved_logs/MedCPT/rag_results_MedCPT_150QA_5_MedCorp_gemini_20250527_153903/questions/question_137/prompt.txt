Document 1 (Title: Viral hepatitis): Hepatitis C is the most common chronic blood-borne infection in the United States. Hepatitis D Hepatitis D is caused by the hepatitis D virus (HDV), or hepatitis delta virus; it belongs to the genus Deltavirus. It is similar to a satellite virus as it can only propagate in the presence of the hepatitis B virus, depending on the helper function of HBV for its replication and expression. It has no independent life cycle, but can survive and replicate as long as HBV infection persists in the host body. It can only cause infection when encapsulated by hepatitis B virus surface antigens. The vaccine for hepatitis B protects against hepatitis D virus because of the latter's dependence on the presence of hepatitis B virus for it to replicate. Hepatitis E
Document 2 (Title: Hepatitis B Vaccine -- Indications): Public health officials have ranked the reduction in vaccine-preventable diseases as one of the top 10 public health achievements in the 21 century. [1] The hepatitis B vaccine is an integral part of this achievement, and its role continues to evolve this century. Hepatitis B vaccination is indicated to prevent active infection with the hepatitis B virus, which can lead to chronic liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma. The virus is highly infectious and can transmit through percutaneous or mucosal exposure to blood and body fluids. The virus even remains viable on environmental surfaces for more than seven days.

Document 3 (Title: Pathology_Robbins): Fig. 16.8 ). Fecal shedding of the virus ends as the IgM titer rises. The IgM response usually declines in a few months followed by the appearance of IgG anti-HAV that persists for years, often conferring lifelong immunity. However, there are no routinely available tests for IgG anti-HAV; the presence of IgG anti-HAV is inferred from the difference between total and IgM anti-HAV. The HAV vaccine, available since 1992, is effective in preventing infection. The outcome of HBV infection varies widely, from (1) acute hepatitis with recovery and clearance of the virus; (2) nonprogressive chronic hepatitis; (3) progressive chronic disease ending in cirrhosis; (4) fulminant hepatitis with massive liver necrosis; and (5) an asymptomatic http://ebooksmedicine.net “healthy” carrier state. HBV-induced chronic liver disease is also an important precursor for the development of HCC. The approximate frequencies of various clinical outcomes of HBV infection are depicted in Fig. 16.9
Document 4 (Title: Viral Hepatitis -- Evaluation -- Chronic Hepatitis B infection): Patients who receive a vaccine for the hepatitis B virus develop protective anti-HBs as a response to recombinant HBsAg in the vaccine. There are no hepatitis B virus DNA or other hepatitis B virus-associated proteins in the vaccine. Therefore, patients who receive the vaccine are not positive for anti-HBc unless they have a previous infection with the hepatitis B virus. [32]
Document 5 (Title: Prospects for control of hepatitis B virus infection: implications of childhood vaccination and long-term protection.): Hepatitis B vaccine has been recommended for high-risk individuals in the United States for more than a decade. This targeted strategy, however, has failed to control hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Universal immunization is being considered as an alternative approach, in particular the inclusion of hepatitis B vaccine with routine childhood vaccinations. Data presented herein demonstrate a high degree of efficacy for hepatitis vaccine with hepatitis B immune globulin in preventing perinatal HBV infection in newborns. Immune response to vaccine was dependent in part on the dose administered, with some enhancement of response if the infant was older at the time of initial injection or if the booster dose was given later. Long-term follow-up showed persistence of vaccine-induced antibody for 5 to 10 years in 90% of immunized infants and adults. Only 3% to 5% of these high-risk individuals had serologic evidence of an HBV infection. None of the infections had been symptomatic and none resulted in a chronic HBV carrier state. Thus, immune responses and efficacy of hepatitis B vaccine in infants were excellent, and immunity and protection against clinically significant HBV infection persisted for at least 5 to 10 years, features essential to success of a program of universal childhood immunization against HBV.
