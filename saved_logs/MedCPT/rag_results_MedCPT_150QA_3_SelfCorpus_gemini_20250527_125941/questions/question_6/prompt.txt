Document 1 (Title: Non-Classical Manifestations of Coronary Artery Disease): While classic angina typically presents as substernal chest pressure exacerbated by exertion and relieved by rest or nitroglycerin, atypical presentations of myocardial ischemia occur frequently, particularly in women, diabetic patients, and elderly individuals. These variant manifestations, sometimes termed angina equivalents, include exertional dyspnea without chest discomfort, epigastric or abdominal discomfort, and jaw or arm pain without accompanying chest sensations. Upper abdominal discomfort represents a particularly challenging variant that may be misattributed to gastrointestinal etiologies, delaying appropriate cardiac evaluation. The pathophysiological basis for these atypical presentations involves complex neurological mechanisms, with cardiac nociceptive signals sharing afferent pathways with those from other visceral structures, particularly the esophagus and upper gastrointestinal tract. Patients with significant cardiovascular risk factors reporting upper abdominal discomfort that correlates with physical exertion warrant careful evaluation for potential cardiac ischemia, even in the absence of classic chest pain. Diagnostic approaches differ markedly between suspected cardiac and gastrointestinal etiologies. While endoscopic evaluation may seem intuitive for abdominal symptoms, non-invasive cardiac assessment should take precedence when the clinical presentation suggests possible angina equivalent. Exercise stress testing, with or without imaging, provides valuable diagnostic and prognostic information by detecting inducible myocardial ischemia under controlled conditions. Functional testing such as hydrogen breath testing for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth or abdominal ultrasonography for biliary disease may be appropriate in patients where cardiac etiologies have been excluded or when symptoms and risk profile suggest primary gastrointestinal pathology.
Document 2 (Title: Uncommon Etiologies of Acute Pancreatitis): While gallstone disease and alcohol consumption account for approximately 70-80% of acute pancreatitis cases in developed countries, recognition of less common etiologies remains critical for appropriate management, particularly when traditional risk factors are absent. Scorpion envenomation represents an unusual but well-documented cause of acute pancreatitis, particularly in regions where certain scorpion species are endemic. The venom of several scorpion species, notably from the Buthidae family, contains peptide toxins that stimulate massive neurotransmitter release from both sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve terminals. The pathophysiology involves hyperstimulation of pancreatic acinar cells via cholinergic pathways, leading to premature intracellular activation of digestive enzymes and subsequent autodigestion of pancreatic tissue. This mechanism differs from medication-induced pancreatitis seen with drugs such as valproic acid, which causes direct cellular injury, or thiazides, which may induce hypercalcemia. While commonly used medications including aspirin at anti-inflammatory doses have been associated with pancreatitis in case reports, the evidence for causality remains weak in many instances. Similarly, oral contraceptives have not demonstrated conclusive links to pancreatitis outside of their potential to exacerbate hypertriglyceridemia in susceptible individuals. Hypothyroidism may indirectly contribute to pancreatitis risk through its association with hypertriglyceridemia, but does not typically serve as a direct trigger for acute pancreatic inflammation.
Document 3 (Title: Nitroglycerin): Nitroglycerin is a vasodilatory drug used primarily to provide relief from anginal chest pain. Nitroglycerin has been FDA approved since 2000 and was first sold as a brand name agent. It is currently FDA approved for the acute relief of an attack or acute prophylaxis of angina pectoris secondary to coronary artery disease. Off label, non FDA approved uses include treatment for hypertensive urgency/emergency, coronary artery spasm, angina secondary to cocaine use, congestive heart failure (CHF), and chronic anal fissures. Along with hydralazine as a combination therapy, it is also indicated in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection in whom ACE inhibitors are contraindicated. Nitroglycerin is occasionally given to reduce radial spasms during coronary angiography through the radial approach. Nitroglycerin was first used in 1879 as a treatment for angina and since it has been part of management to relieve anginal chest pain.[1] Although nitroglycerin has a vasodilatory effect in both arteries and veins, the profound desired effects caused by nitroglycerin are primarily due to venodilation.[2] Venodilation causes pooling of blood within the venous system, reducing preload to the heart, which causes a decrease in cardiac work, reducing anginal symptoms secondary to demand ischemia. Arterial vasodilation will still occur and contribute to the relief of anginal symptoms.[3][4] Vasodilation of the coronary arteries will cause increased blood flow to the heart, increasing perfusion, but this effect remains minimal compared to the effects of venodilation.

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
Question: A 40-year-old zookeeper presents to the emergency department complaining of severe abdominal pain that radiates to her back, and nausea. The pain started 2 days ago and slowly increased until she could not tolerate it any longer. Past medical history is significant for hypertension and hypothyroidism. Additionally, she reports that she was recently stung by one of the zoo’s smaller scorpions, but did not seek medical treatment. She takes aspirin, levothyroxine, oral contraceptive pills, and a multivitamin daily. Family history is noncontributory. Today, her blood pressure is 108/58 mm Hg, heart rate is 99/min, respiratory rate is 21/min, and temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F). On physical exam, she is a well-developed, obese female that looks unwell. Her heart has a regular rate and rhythm. Radial pulses are weak but symmetric. Her lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Her lateral left ankle is swollen, erythematous, and painful to palpate. An abdominal CT is consistent with acute pancreatitis. Which of the following is the most likely etiology for this patient’s disease?
Options:
A. Aspirin
B. Oral contraceptive pills
C. Scorpion sting
D. Hypothyroidism
