        "content": "Hypertensive disorders complicate 5-10% of pregnancies and contribute significantly to maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality worldwide. Preeclampsia, a pregnancy-specific multisystem disorder characterized by hypertension and end-organ dysfunction after 20 weeks gestation, affects approximately 3-5% of pregnancies. Early detection through regular prenatal assessments remains crucial for optimizing maternal and fetal outcomes. The contemporary diagnostic criteria for preeclampsia focus on both blood pressure parameters and evidence of maternal organ dysfunction. Hypertension, defined as systolic blood pressure \u2265140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure \u226590 mmHg on two occasions at least four hours apart, represents the fundamental requirement. Proteinuria, historically considered mandatory for diagnosis, is now recognized as just one of several possible indicators of end-organ involvement. Quantification of urinary protein excretion through 24-hour urine collection remains the gold standard assessment, with significant proteinuria defined as \u2265300 mg in 24 hours or a protein/creatinine ratio \u22650.3 mg/dL in a random sample. Other laboratory evaluations, including liver function tests and coagulation studies, help assess hepatic involvement and potential HELLP syndrome (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets). Leukocytosis may occur but lacks specificity for preeclampsia. Clinical manifestations often include rapid weight gain and generalized edema, particularly facial and periorbital, distinguishing it from dependent edema commonly observed in normal pregnancy. Progressive symptoms including headache, visual disturbances, and epigastric pain suggest impending eclampsia, necessitating urgent intervention.",

        "title": "Ethylene glycol poisoning",
        "content": "Signs and symptoms Signs of ethylene glycol poisoning depend upon the time after ingestion. Symptoms usually follow a three step progression, although poisoned individuals will not always develop each stage. Stage 1 (30 minutes to 12 hours) consists of neurological and gastrointestinal symptoms and looks similar to alcohol poisoning. Poisoned individuals may appear to be intoxicated, dizzy, lacking coordination of muscle movements, drooling, depressed, and have slurred speech, seizures, abnormal eye movements, headaches, and confusion. Irritation to the stomach may cause nausea and vomiting. Also seen are excessive thirst and urination. Over time, the body metabolizes ethylene glycol into other toxins. Stage 2 (12 to 36 hours) where signs of \u201calcohol\u201d poisoning appear to resolve, underlying severe internal damage is still occurring. An elevated heart rate, hyperventilation or increased breathing effort, and dehydration may start to develop, along with high blood pressure and metabolic acidosis. These symptoms are a result of accumulation of organic acids formed by the metabolism of ethylene glycol. Additionally low calcium concentrations in the blood, overactive muscle reflexes, muscle spasms, QT interval prolongation, and congestive heart failure may occur. If untreated, death most commonly occurs during this period. Stage 3 (24 to 72 hours) kidney failure is the result of ethylene glycol poisoning. In cats, this stage occurs 12\u201324 hours after consuming antifreeze; in dogs, at 36\u201372 hours after consuming antifreeze. During this stage, severe kidney failure is developing secondary to calcium oxalate crystals forming in the kidneys. Severe lethargy, coma, depression, vomiting, seizures, drooling, and inappetence may be seen. Other symptoms include acute tubular necrosis, red blood cells in the urine, excess proteins in the urine, lower back pain, decreased or absent production of urine, elevated blood concentration of potassium, and acute kidney failure. If kidney failure occurs it is typically reversible, although weeks or months of supportive care including hemodialysis may be required before kidney function returns.",

        "title": "Life-Threatening Antipsychotic Adverse Reactions",
        "content": "Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) represents a potentially fatal adverse reaction to antipsychotic medications, characterized by a distinctive tetrad of fever, rigidity, altered mental status, and autonomic instability. While traditionally associated with first-generation (typical) antipsychotics, particularly high-potency agents such as haloperidol, all antipsychotics\u2014including second-generation (atypical) agents like risperidone\u2014carry this risk, albeit with varying incidence. The pathophysiological mechanism centrally involves dopamine receptor blockade in the nigrostriatal pathway and hypothalamus, leading to dysregulated muscle activity and temperature regulation. Increasing evidence suggests additional contributions from sympathoadrenal hyperactivity and direct peripheral effects on skeletal muscle. Risk factors include rapid dose escalation, high-potency agents, parenteral administration, concurrent lithium therapy, dehydration, and possibly genetic predisposition affecting dopamine receptor sensitivity or serotonin pathway modulation. Clinical manifestations typically evolve over 24-72 hours following antipsychotic initiation or dose increase. Hyperthermia, often exceeding 38.5\u00b0C, represents a cardinal feature, accompanied by lead-pipe muscle rigidity, diaphoresis, and labile vital signs. Laboratory abnormalities include markedly elevated creatine kinase (often >1000 U/L) reflecting rhabdomyolysis, leukocytosis, electrolyte disturbances, and myoglobinuria potentially culminating in acute kidney injury. Management centers on immediate discontinuation of the offending agent, supportive care addressing hyperthermia and dehydration, and consideration of specific pharmacological interventions. Benzodiazepines provide symptomatic relief for agitation and rigidity while dantrolene may directly address hypertonicity through peripheral mechanisms. Dopaminergic agents such as bromocriptine theoretically counteract the central dopamine blockade, though evidence for their efficacy remains limited. Antipyretics demonstrate minimal effectiveness as fever derives from muscle hypermetabolism rather than altered hypothalamic set-point. Complications include respiratory compromise from chest wall rigidity, acute renal failure from myoglobinuria, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and cardiopulmonary arrest. Similar hyperthermia syndromes include serotonin syndrome, malignant hyperthermia, and anticholinergic toxicity, differentiated by exposure history and specific clinical features.",
