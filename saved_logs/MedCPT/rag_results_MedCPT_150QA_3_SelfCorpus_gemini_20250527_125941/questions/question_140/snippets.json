        "content": "Hemophilia represents a group of hereditary coagulation disorders with distinctive genetic, laboratory, and clinical characteristics determining diagnosis, management approaches, and potential complications. Genetic analysis reveals predominantly X-linked inheritance patterns, with affected males inheriting maternal mutations while females typically serve as asymptomatic carriers due to X-chromosome inactivation patterns. This sex-linked transmission creates characteristic family distribution patterns distinct from autosomal inheritance disorders. Clinical presentation typically develops gradually rather than appearing immediately at birth, with diagnosis often occurring after progressive recognition of excessive bruising, joint bleeding, or prolonged bleeding following minor trauma or surgical procedures during early childhood. Laboratory evaluation reveals specific factor deficiencies, with hemophilia A demonstrating factor VIII deficiency while hemophilia B (Christmas disease) results from factor IX deficiency rather than alterations in factor X levels. Contemporary management approaches employ factor replacement therapy using either plasma-derived or recombinant clotting factor concentrates, though approximately 20-30% of severely affected individuals develop neutralizing alloantibodies (inhibitors) following repeated exposure to replacement therapy. These inhibitors represent a major treatment complication necessitating alternative hemostatic approaches including bypassing agents or immune tolerance induction protocols. Advances in molecular diagnostics have enabled expanded genetic screening capabilities, allowing carrier detection and prenatal diagnosis through chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis when desired by affected families. These diagnostic capabilities facilitate informed reproductive decision-making and early intervention planning for affected pregnancies. Ongoing research explores gene therapy approaches potentially offering definitive treatment through targeted genetic modification of hepatocytes to enable endogenous clotting factor production.",

        "title": "Coagulation Defects in Young Women with Menorrhagia",
        "content": "Menorrhagia, defined as excessive menstrual bleeding lasting more than 7 days or exceeding 80 mL per cycle, affects approximately 10-30% of women of reproductive age, with a significant proportion attributable to underlying bleeding disorders. When persistent since menarche and accompanied by other mucocutaneous bleeding manifestations, inherited coagulation disorders warrant particular consideration. Von Willebrand disease (VWD), the most common inherited bleeding disorder, affects approximately 1% of the general population and accounts for up to 20% of unexplained menorrhagia cases in otherwise healthy women. VWD results from quantitative or qualitative deficiencies in von Willebrand factor (VWF), a large multimeric glycoprotein that mediates platelet adhesion to subendothelial collagen and serves as a carrier for factor VIII. This autosomal inheritance pattern leads to equal sex distribution, contrasting with the X-linked recessive inheritance of hemophilia A, which primarily affects males. Laboratory evaluation of VWD typically reveals prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) due to secondary factor VIII deficiency, while prothrombin time (PT) and platelet count remain normal. Patients typically present with mucocutaneous bleeding manifestations including easy bruising, epistaxis, gingival bleeding, and particularly menorrhagia in women. Family history often reveals similar bleeding tendencies in first-degree relatives of both sexes, contrasting with the maternal uncle pattern in hemophilia A or the prothrombotic tendencies in conditions like protein C deficiency or antiphospholipid syndrome.",

        "title": "Growth promoting effects of IGF-1",
        "content": "The first demonstration that exogenous IGF-1 stimulates growth was the administration of purified hormone to hypophysectomised rats. After the biosynthesis of IGF-1 identical to the native hormone, trials of its use in humans were begun; first in adults and then in children. Our group was the first to introduce long term administration of biosynthetic IGF-1 to children with primary IGF-1 deficiency\u2014primary GH insensitivity or LS. The finding that daily IGF-1 administration raises serum alkaline phosphatase, which is an indicator of osteoblastic activity, and serum procollagen, in addition to IGFBP-3, led to long term treatment. Treatment of patients with LS was also initiated in other parts of the world. The difference between us and the other groups was that we used a once daily dose, whereas the others administered IGF-1 twice daily. Table 1 compares the linear growth response of children with LS treated by four different groups. It can be seen that before treatment the mean growth velocity was 3\u20134.7 cm/year and that this increased after IGF-1 treatment to 8.2\u20139.1 cm/year, followed by a lower velocity of 5.5\u20136.4 cm/year in the next two years. (In GH treatment the highest growth velocity registered is also in the first year of treatment.) Figure 5 illustrates the growth response to IGF-1 in eight children during the first years of treatment. Ranke and colleagues reported that two of their patients had reached the third centile (Tanner), as did the patient of Krzisnik and Battelino; however, most patients did not reach a normal final height. The reasons may be late initiation of treatment, irregular IGF-1 administration, underdosage, etc. Ranke et al conclude that long term treatment of patients with LS promoted growth and, if treatment is started at an early age, there is a considerable potential for achieving height normalisation. Because no patient in our group was treated since early infancy to final height we cannot confirm this opinion. When the growth response to GH treatment in infants with IGHD was compared with that of IGF-1 in infants with LS we found that the infants with IGHD responded faster and better than those with LS. However, the small number of patients and the differences in growth retardation between the two groups makes it difficult to reach a conclusion. Both hormones stimulated linear growth, but GH seemed more effective than IGF-1. One cause may be the greater growth deficit of the infants with LS than those with IGHD, an insufficient dose of IGF-1, or that there is a need for some GH to provide an adequate stem cell population of prechondrocytes to enable full expression of the growth promoting action of IGF-1, as postulated by Green and colleagues and Ohlson et al. All the above findings based on a few clinical studies with small groups of patients and a few experimental studies remain at present controversial. The crucial question is whether there are any, and if so, whether there are sufficient IGF-1 receptors in the \u201cprogenitor cartilage zone\u201d of the epiphyseal cartilage to respond to endocrine and exogenous IGF-1. Using the mandibular condyle of 2 day old ICR mice, Maor et al showed that these condyles, which resemble the epiphyseal plates of the long bones, contain IGF-1 and high affinity IGF-1 receptors also in the chondroprogenitor cell layers, which enables them to respond to IGF-1 in vitro. Sims et al, using mice with GH receptor KO, showed that IGF-1 administration stimulates the growth (width) of the tibial growth plate and that IGF-1 has a GH independent effect on the growth plate. These findings are similar to those found when treating hypophysectomised rats with IGF-1. In conclusion, IGF-1 is an important growth hormone, mediating the anabolic and linear growth promoting effect of pituitary GH protein. It has a GH independent growth stimulating effect, which with respect to cartilage cells is possibly optimised by the synergistic action with GH.",
