        "content": "Urolithiasis represents a common urological condition with diverse pathophysiological mechanisms reflected in variable urinary parameters. Urinalysis provides critical diagnostic information both for confirming the diagnosis and suggesting stone composition, which guides preventive strategies. The hallmark microscopic finding in symptomatic nephrolithiasis is hematuria, present in approximately 85% of cases, though its absence does not exclude the diagnosis, particularly with complete ureteral obstruction. Specific gravity typically reflects the patient's hydration status rather than stone pathophysiology. Urinary pH represents a particularly valuable parameter, as it provides insight into stone composition and underlying metabolic abnormalities. Struvite stones, composed of magnesium ammonium phosphate and associated with urease-producing bacterial infections, typically form in alkaline urine (pH >7.0) and may present with positive nitrite tests indicating bacterial presence. Conversely, uric acid stones develop exclusively in acidic environments, typically requiring persistent urinary pH below 5.5 for formation and growth. Elevated urine acidity may result from increased acid production (high animal protein intake), reduced ammoniagenesis (insulin resistance), or enhanced acid excretion (chronic diarrheal states). Calcium oxalate stones, the most common variant, demonstrate weaker pH dependence, though formation is generally favored in mildly acidic to neutral urine. Cystine stones, occurring in patients with hereditary cystinuria, form preferentially in acidic urine due to the pH-dependent solubility of cystine. Notably, proteinuria is typically absent or minimal in uncomplicated nephrolithiasis unless coexisting renal parenchymal disease or obstructive nephropathy is present. The temporal relationship between symptom onset and laboratory evaluation must be considered, as microscopic findings may evolve, with hematuria potentially resolving within hours of stone passage.",

        "content": "Hypertensive disorders complicate 5-10% of pregnancies and contribute significantly to maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality worldwide. Preeclampsia, a pregnancy-specific multisystem disorder characterized by hypertension and end-organ dysfunction after 20 weeks gestation, affects approximately 3-5% of pregnancies. Early detection through regular prenatal assessments remains crucial for optimizing maternal and fetal outcomes. The contemporary diagnostic criteria for preeclampsia focus on both blood pressure parameters and evidence of maternal organ dysfunction. Hypertension, defined as systolic blood pressure \u2265140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure \u226590 mmHg on two occasions at least four hours apart, represents the fundamental requirement. Proteinuria, historically considered mandatory for diagnosis, is now recognized as just one of several possible indicators of end-organ involvement. Quantification of urinary protein excretion through 24-hour urine collection remains the gold standard assessment, with significant proteinuria defined as \u2265300 mg in 24 hours or a protein/creatinine ratio \u22650.3 mg/dL in a random sample. Other laboratory evaluations, including liver function tests and coagulation studies, help assess hepatic involvement and potential HELLP syndrome (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets). Leukocytosis may occur but lacks specificity for preeclampsia. Clinical manifestations often include rapid weight gain and generalized edema, particularly facial and periorbital, distinguishing it from dependent edema commonly observed in normal pregnancy. Progressive symptoms including headache, visual disturbances, and epigastric pain suggest impending eclampsia, necessitating urgent intervention.",

        "content": "The pressure within the renal pelvis is normally close to zero. When this pressure increases because of obstruction or reflux, the pelvis and calyces dilate. The degree of hydronephrosis that develops depends on the duration, degree, and site of the obstruction (Figure 12\u20134). The higher the obstruction, the greater the effect on the kidney. If the renal pelvis is entirely intrarenal and the obstruction is at the ureteropelvic junction, all the pressure will be exerted on the parenchyma (Klein et al., 2010). If the renal pelvis is extrarenal, only part of the pressure produced by a ureteropelvic stenosis is exerted on the parenchyma; this is because the extrarenal pelvis is embedded in fat and dilates more readily, thus \"decompressing\" the hydronephrotic left renal pelvis. Low density mass (P) in the left renal sinus had an attenuation value similar to that of water, suggesting the correct diagnosis. Unless intravenous contrast material is used, differentiation from a peripelvic cyst may be difficult. In the earlier stages, the renal pelvic musculature undergoes compensatory hypertrophy in its effort to force urine past the obstruction. Later, however, the muscle becomes stretched and atonic and decompensated. The progression of hydronephrotic atrophy is as follows (Chevalier, 2010; Rodriguez, 2004): 1. The earliest changes in the development of hydronephrosis are seen in the calyces. The end of a normal calyx is concave because of the papilla that projects into it; with increased intrapelvic pressure, the fornices become blunt and rounded. With persistence of increased intrapelvic pressure, the papilla becomes flattened, then convex (clubbed) as a result of compression enhanced by ischemic atrophy (Figure 12\u20135). The parenchyma between the calyces is affected to a lesser extent. The changes in the renal parenchyma are due to (a) compression atrophy from increased intrapelvic pressure (more accentuated with intrarenal pelves) and (b) ischemic atrophy from hemodynamic changes, mainly manifested in arcuate vessels that run at the base of the pyramids parallel to the kidney outline and are more vulnerable to compression between the renal capsule and the centrally increasing intrapelvic pressure. 2. This spotty atrophy is caused by the nature of the blood supply of the kidney. The arterioles are end arteries; therefore, ischemia is most marked in the areas farthest from the interlobular arteries. As the back pressure increases, hydronephrosis progresses, with the cells nearest the main arteries exhibiting the greatest resistance. 3. This increased pressure is transmitted up the tubules. The tubules become dilated, and their cells atrophy from ischemia. It should be pointed out that a few instances of dilated renal pelves and calyces are not due to the presence of obstruction. Rarely, the renal cavities are congenitally capacious and thus simulate hydronephrosis. More commonly, hydronephrosis may occur in childhood owing to the back pressure associated with vesicoureteral reflux. If the valvular incompetence resolves (and this is common), some degree of the hydronephrotic changes may persist. These persisting changes may cause the physician to suspect the presence of obstruction, which may lead to unnecessary surgery. A radioisotope renogram to assess ureteral drainage function can be performed to determine whether organic obstruction is present. 4. Only in unilateral hydronephrosis are the advanced stages of hydronephrotic atrophy seen. Eventually, the kidney is completely destroyed and appears as a thin walled sac filled with clear fluid (water and electrolytes) or pus (Figure 12\u20136).",
