Document 1 (Title: Reversed-phase chromatography): Stationary phases In the 1970s, most liquid chromatography was performed using a solid support stationary phase (also called a column) containing unmodified silica or alumina resins. This type of technique is now referred to as normal-phase chromatography. Since the stationary phase is hydrophilic in this technique, molecules with hydrophilic properties contained within the mobile phase will have a high affinity for the stationary phase, and therefore will adsorb to the column packing. Hydrophobic molecules experience less of an affinity for the column packing, and will pass through to be eluted and detected first. Elution of the hydrophilic molecules adsorbed to the column packing requires the use of more hydrophilic or more polar solvents in the mobile phase to shift the distribution of the particles in the stationary phase towards that of the mobile phase.
Document 2 (Title: Physiology_Levy): Fig. 16.1 illustrates action potentials found in different cardiac cells. Two main types of action potentials occur in the heart and are depicted. One type, the fast response, occurs in normal atrial and ventricular myocytes and in the specialized conducting fibers (Purkinje fibers of the heart) and is divided into five phases. The rapid upstroke of the action potential is designated phase 0. The upstroke is followed by a brief period of partial, early repolarization (phase 1) and then by a plateau (phase 2) that persists for approximately 0.1 to 0.2 second. The membrane then repolarizes (phase 3) until the resting state of polarization (phase 4) is again attained. Final repolarization (phase 3) develops more slowly than depolarization (phase 0). The other type of action potential, the slow response, occurs in the sinoatrial (SA) node, which is the natural pacemaker region of the heart, and in the atrioventricular (AV) node, which is the specialized tissue that conducts the cardiac
Document 3 (Title: Reverse-phase chromatography of polar biological substances: separation of catechol compounds by high-performance liquid chromatography.): Catecholamines and their metabolites have been separated isocratically by reverse-phase chromatography with aqueous (no organic solvent admixed) eluents. Unlike ion-exchange or ion-pair chromatography, mixtures of both acidic and basic substances can be separated in a single chromatographic run, because the retention is governed by hydrophobic interactions between the nonpolar moiety of the solute molecules and the octadecyl-silica stationary phase. The relative retention values strongly depend on the pH of the eluent, which governs the degree of dissociation of ionogenic solutes. The reproducibility of the results and the stability and efficiency of the chromatographic systems make this approach particularly attractive for use in clinical analysis.
Document 4 (Title: Chromatography -- Introduction -- Column Chromatography): This is the most commonly used type, where a column of fiberglass or steel filled with silica particles acts as a stationary phase. [1] The mobile phase is gas or liquid. In normal-phase column chromatography, a polar stationary phase separates non-polar compounds; in reversed-phase chromatography, the nonpolar stationary phase and the polar mobile phase are used. [7]
Document 5 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): Phase I reactions usually convert the parent drug to a more polar metabolite by introducing or unmasking a functional group (–OH, –NH2, –SH). Often these metabolites are inactive, although in some instances activity is only modified or even enhanced. If phase I metabolites are sufficiently polar, they may be readily excreted. However, many phase I products are not eliminated rapidly and undergo a subsequent reaction in which an endogenous substrate such as glucuronic acid, sulfuric acid, acetic acid, or an amino acid combines with the newly incorporated functional group to form a highly polar conjugate. Such conjugation or synthetic reactions are the hallmarks of phase II metabolism. A great variety of drugs undergo these sequential biotransformation reactions, although in some instances, the parent drug may already possess a functional group that may form a conjugate directly. For example, the hydrazide moiety of isoniazid is known to form an
Document 6 (Title: Chromatography -- Introduction -- Stationary Phase): The stationary phase is a crucial component of chromatography that interacts with analytes as they pass through, leading to separation. Solid, liquid, or gas can be held over a supporting medium. The stationary phase interacts with various mixture components based on the polarity, affinity, size, and charge. Thus, different analytes have varying degrees of interaction with the stationary phase, leading to differential retention times and elution profiles. [1] Different types of chromatography use combinations of stationary and mobile phases to achieve separation. Refer to image 1 for the classification of chromatography.
Document 7 (Title: Comparative study of chromatography on thin layers impregnated with organic stationary phases. Chromatographic separation of nitrophenols.): The chromatographic behaviour of nitrophenols on thin layers of silica gel and cellulose was compared, both without impregnation and impregnated with non-aqueous polar stationary phases (formamide, dimethylformamide) and less polar stationary phases (liquid paraffin, octan-1-ol, 1-bromonaphthalene). Cellulose is preferred when using formamide or dimethylformamide if a pure partition process is required. For each particular analyte a certain amount of the stationary phase is always required to suppress the adsorption activity of silica gel. Separation by reversed-phase thin-layer chromatography is strongly affected by the type of stationary phase (the possibility of forming charge-transfer complexes with 1-bromonaphthalene) and its support (the acidic properties of silica gel and its adsorption activity), the mobile phase (content of organic modifier, pH, presence of salts) and the properties of the solutes (polarity, ionizability).
Document 8 (Title: Reversed-phase chromatography): Reversed-phase chromatography is a technique using alkyl chains covalently bonded to the stationary phase particles in order to create a hydrophobic stationary phase, which has a stronger affinity for hydrophobic or less polar compounds. The use of a hydrophobic stationary phase is essentially the reverse of normal phase chromatography, since the polarity of the mobile and stationary phases have been inverted – hence the term reversed-phase chromatography. Reversed-phase chromatography employs a polar (aqueous) mobile phase. As a result, hydrophobic molecules in the polar mobile phase tend to adsorb to the hydrophobic stationary phase, and hydrophilic molecules in the mobile phase will pass through the column and are eluted first. Hydrophobic molecules can be eluted from the column by decreasing the polarity of the mobile phase using an organic (non-polar) solvent, which reduces hydrophobic interactions. The more hydrophobic the molecule, the more strongly it will bind to the
Document 9 (Title: Reversed-phase chromatography of proteins with diphenyl-silica column and hydro-organic eluents containing two organic solvents.): High-performance liquid chromatography of proteins with silica bonded diphenyl stationary phase and hydro-organic mobile phases with linear gradient elution has been carried out with binary organic modifiers. The use of a mixture of 2-propanol and 1-butanol facilitated elution at total organic modifier concentrations significantly lower than with the use of 2-propanol alone. Furthermore higher protein recovery and retention of biological activity was obtained with the binary organic modifier because the increase in eluent strength with binary organic modifier was greater than that of the denaturing strength of the eluent. The use of a short, 3 cm long, column, relatively high flow-rates and steep gradients was also advantageous in attenuating protein denaturation. The results were interpreted within the framework of a theoretical treatment of the combined effect of the retention process and denaturation reaction simultaneously occurring in the column.
Document 10 (Title: Chromatography -- Introduction -- Ion Exchange Chromatography): This relies on the reversible interaction between charged analytes (ions) and oppositely charged groups immobilized on a solid stationary phase. This interaction allows ions to be selectively retained and then eluted from the stationary phase by manipulating the composition of the mobile phase. Cation and anion exchange resins are used in the stationary phase to isolate anionic and cationic substances, respectively. [10]
Document 11 (Title: Chromatography -- Introduction -- Mobile Phase): The mobile phase is a liquid or gas that carries the sample and propels the compounds through the stationary phase, resulting in separation. By adjusting the composition of the mobile phase, the migration rate can be controlled, leading to efficient separation. The mobile phase can be isocratic or gradient, polar or nonpolar, based on the nature of the analyte. [4]
Document 12 (Title: Phenols as internal standards in reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography in pharmaceutical analysis.): To find a series of compounds for use as internal standards in reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, about 70 commercially available phenols were chromatographed under various conditions. The stationary phases used were hydrocarbon chemically bonded silica gels (phenyl, C8 and C18 columns). The mobile phases consisted of 10-60% aqueous-organic solutions (organic solvents, methanol, acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran and mixtures thereof; aqueous phases, water, buffer solutions of pH 2 and 7, 20 mM sodium sulphate or water containing 5 mM of counter ion). A series of 30 phenol derivatives showed a constant order of elution regardless of the separation conditions and are useful as potential internal standards.
Document 13 (Title: Chromatography): Special techniques Reversed-phase chromatography Reversed-phase chromatography (RPC) is any liquid chromatography procedure in which the mobile phase is significantly more polar than the stationary phase. It is so named because in normal-phase liquid chromatography, the mobile phase is significantly less polar than the stationary phase. Hydrophobic molecules in the mobile phase tend to adsorb to the relatively hydrophobic stationary phase. Hydrophilic molecules in the mobile phase will tend to elute first. Separating columns typically comprise a C8 or C18 carbon-chain bonded to a silica particle substrate. Hydrophobic interaction chromatography
Document 14 (Title: Aqueous normal-phase chromatography): In normal-phase chromatography, the least polar compounds elute first and the most polar compounds elute last. The mobile phase consists of a nonpolar solvent such as hexane or heptane mixed with a slightly more polar solvent such as isopropanol, ethyl acetate or chloroform. Retention decreases as the amount of polar solvent in the mobile phase increases. In reversed phase chromatography, the most polar compounds elute first with the most nonpolar compounds eluting last. The mobile phase is generally a binary mixture of water and a miscible polar organic solvent like methanol, acetonitrile or THF. Retention increases as the amount of the polar solvent (water) in the mobile phase increases. Normal phase chromatography, an adsorptive mechanism, is used for the analysis of solutes readily soluble in organic solvents, based on their polar differences such as amines, acids, metal complexes, etc.. Reversed-phase chromatography, a partition mechanism, is typically used for separations by
Document 15 (Title: Neurology_Adams): Spikes are transient high-voltage waveforms that have a pointed peak at recording speeds and duration of 20 to 70 ms; a sharp waves is a similarly configured transient with a duration of 70 to 200 ms (Fig. 2-7F). Spikes or sharp waves that occur interictally are referred to as epileptiform discharges. At times, it is possible to infer localization from the reversal of the polarity of a sharp transient or spike in the EEG record. This “phase reversal” between two channels implies that the electrical activity originates near the site of the position of the common electrode (Fig. 2-7G, H).
