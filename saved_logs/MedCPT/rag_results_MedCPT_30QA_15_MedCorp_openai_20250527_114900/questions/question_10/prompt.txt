Document 1 (Title: Programmed cell death): Basic morphological and biochemical features of PCD have been conserved in both plant and animal kingdoms. Specific types of plant cells carry out unique cell-death programs. These have common features with animal apoptosis—for instance, nuclear DNA degradation—but they also have their own peculiarities, such as nuclear degradation triggered by the collapse of the vacuole in tracheary elements of the xylem. Janneke Balk and Christopher J. Leaver, of the Department of Plant Sciences, University of Oxford, carried out research on mutations in the mitochondrial genome of sun-flower cells. Results of this research suggest that mitochondria play the same key role in vascular plant PCD as in other eukaryotic cells.
Document 2 (Title: Cell_Biology_Alberts): thousands of caspase substrates have been identified. Which ones are the critical proteins that must be cleaved to trigger the major cell remodeling events underlying apoptosis? how did the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis evolve, and what is the advantage of having mitochondria play such a central role in regulating apoptosis? how are “don’t eat me” signals eliminated or inactivated during apoptosis to allow the cells to be phagocytosed? Which statements are true? Explain why or why not. 18–1 In normal adult tissues, cell death usually balances cell division. 18–2 Mammalian cells that do not have cytochrome c should be resistant to apoptosis induced by DNA damage. Discuss the following problems.
Document 3 (Title: Ca(2+)-dependent mechanisms of cytotoxicity and programmed cell death.): There is increasing evidence that the calcium ion plays a critical role in both toxic cell killing and programmed cell death. Thus, in a variety of experimental systems a perturbation of intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis due to increased Ca2+ influx and/or inhibition of Ca2+ extrusion has been found to be an early event in the development of cell injury. It is clear that sustained increases in intracellular Ca2+ can activate cytotoxic mechanisms which result in perturbations of cellular structure and function. For example, the stimulation of Ca(2+)-dependent proteases can result in a disruption of cytoskeletal organization and the formation of surface protrusions (blebs) and Ca(2+)-mediated phospholipase activation can result in an impairment of mitochondrial function with collapse of membrane potential and cessation of ATP synthesis. The activation of a Ca2+, Mg(2+)-dependent nuclear endonuclease is associated with chromatin cleavage and appears to play a crucial role in programmed cell death (apoptosis) in the immune system and other tissues. There is also recent evidence that this process may be responsible for the immunotoxicity of dioxins and organotin compounds and involved in the killing of adenocarcinoma cells by tumor necrosis factor alpha. Although calcium ions appear to be required for endonuclease activity during apoptosis, this process is also influenced by other factors, e.g. protein kinase C activity, intracellular polyamine and Zn2+ levels, chromatin structure, etc. Thus, the regulation of endonuclease activity under both physiological and toxicological conditions appears to be complex and to involve multiple factors.
Document 4 (Title: Pathology_Robbins): (glucose, glutamine, ISCHEMIA, ATP Lipid, protein building blocks Fig. 1.11 Roles of the mitochondria. Besides the efficient generation of ATP from carbohydrate and fatty acid substrates, mitochondria play an important role in intermediary metabolism, serving as the source of molecules used to synthesize lipids and proteins, and they also are centrally involved in cell life and-death decisions. Mitochondria provide the enzymatic machinery for oxidative phosphorylation (and thus the relatively efficient generation of energy from glucose and fatty acid substrates). They also have central roles in anabolic metabolism and the regulation programmed cell death, so-called “apoptosis” ( Fig. 1.11
Document 5 (Title: Myocardial Protection -- Anatomy and Physiology -- Mitochondrial Protection): Mitochondrial protection is crucial because mitochondria, while providing ATP to cardiomyocytes, also play a central role in activating cell death pathways. The mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) is a nonselective channel in the inner mitochondrial membrane that remains closed during ischemia-induced acidosis, offering some protection. However, if the mPTP opens, it leads to depolarization, uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation, intracellular ATP depletion, and cell death. Protecting the heart during ischemia focuses on preventing mPTP opening and promoting the activation of the mitochondrial ATP-dependent potassium channel. This invokes 2 primary protective pathways: the reperfusion injury salvage kinase pathway, activated via G-protein-coupled receptors, and the survivor-activating factor enhancement pathway, which operates through tumor necrosis factor-alpha receptors.
Document 6 (Title: Jasmonate): Following its role in defense, JAs have also been implicated in cell death and leaf senescence. JA can interact with many kinases and transcription factors associated with senescence. JA can also induce mitochondrial death by inducing the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROSs). These compounds disrupt mitochondria membranes and compromise the cell by causing apoptosis, or programmed cell death. JAs' roles in these processes are suggestive of methods by which the plant defends itself against biotic challenges and limits the spread of infections.
Document 7 (Title: Insect muscle as a model for programmed cell death.): Programmed cell death (PCD) is a fundamental component of development in virtually all animals. Despite the ubiquity of this phenomenon, little is known about what tells a cell to die, and less still about the physiological and molecular mechanisms that bring about death. One system that has proven to be very amenable for the study of PCD is the intersegmental muscle (ISM) of the tobacco hawkmoth Manduca sexta. These giant muscle cells are used during the eclosion (emergence) behavior of the adult moth, and then die during the subsequent 30 h. This review uses the ISMs as a model system to address questions that are basic to any cell death system, including the following: (1) how do cells know when to die; (2) what physiological changes accompany death; (3) what are the molecular mechanisms that mediate death; and (4) do all cells die by the same process? For the ISMs, the trigger for PCD is a decline in the circulating titer of the insect molting hormone, 20-hydroxyecdysone (20-HE). During cell death there are rapid decreases in both the myofibrillar sensitivity to intracellular calcium and the resulting force of fiber contraction. The ability of the ISMs to undergo PCD requires the repression and activation of specific genes. Two of the repressed genes encode actin and myosin. One of the upregulated presumptive cell-death genes encodes polyubiquitin, which appears to play a critical role in the rapid proteolysis that accompanies ISM death.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Document 8 (Title: Cardiac Electrical and Structural Remodeling -- Introduction): Even with the falling rates of cardiovascular deaths, the events of deaths attributable to sudden cardiac death keep rising. [1] A total of 350000 events of sudden cardiac death are estimated to occur in the United States every year. Coronary artery disease often leads to complex electrical and structural remodeling of the heart due to myocardial injury. This remodeling is the root cause that precipitates ventricular arrhythmias, which often lead to sudden cardiac death. Cardiac remodeling occurs in response to stress, either functional stress or structural stress. This remodeling plays a vital role in the disease process that ensues. Initially, the electrical and structural remodeling helps in compensating the cardiac performance. But over time, these compensatory mechanisms often lead to pump failure and/or fatal arrhythmias. [2] Both atria and ventricles are affected by electrical remodeling. This process eventually leads to atrial fibrillation and fatal ventricular arrhythmias. [3] Structural remodeling of the heart can be physiologic growth occurring in response to exercise, pregnancy, or during the postnatal period. It can also be pathologic hypertrophy in response to neurohumoral activation, injury to myocardium, or hypertension. Heart failure and malignant arrhythmia are often precipitated by pathological hypertrophy of the heart. However, they don’t occur with the physiological growth of the heart. [2]
Document 9 (Title: A possible role for calcium in oxidative plant stress.): Disruption of calcium homoeostasis may be crucially important in damaging animal cells under oxidising conditions. In hepatocytes, oxidative stress causes an increase in cytosolic calcium, a process which is thought to be largely responsible for subsequent cell death. The oxidation of glutathione precedes a flux of calcium into the cytoplasm from internal and external sources. The possibility that similar events occur in plant cells has been tested using strips of epidermis taken from leaves of Commelina communis. The closure of stomata in response to many chemical or physical stimuli is thought to involve a transient rise in cytosolic calcium. Paraquat (10(-4) M) and hydrogen peroxide (10(-3) M) caused a marked reduction in stomatal aperture when included in the incubation medium of illuminated epidermal strips. The calcium channel blocker verapamil (10(-5) M) protected stomata from hydrogen peroxide-induced closure while the ion chelator EGTA (2 x 10(-3) M) protected stomata in both oxidising treatments. These results are discussed in so far as they support the hypothesis that a rise in cytosolic calcium may play a role in the pathology of oxidative stress in plant cells through a mechanism analogous to the liver cell system.
Document 10 (Title: New York State Infection Control -- Issues of Concern -- Histopathology): The cellular and tissue changes induced by a shock are essentially those also seen in hypoxic injury states. As oxygen tension within the cell decreases, there is a loss of oxidative phosphorylation and decreased ATP generation. The sodium pump fails, and potassium is lost with a concurrent influx of sodium and water, causing the cell to swell in size. With worsening hypoxia, there is a progressive loss of glycogen and decreased protein synthesis. As hypoxic injury continues, the cytoskeleton will disperse, and “blebs” will appear. Mitochondria will also exhibit swelling at this stage while the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) remains dilated. If oxygen is restored, a lot of these processes and injury can be reversed. If hypoxia persists, irreversible injury and cellular necrosis will ensue. Cells at this stage exhibit severe swelling of mitochondria, extensive damage to plasma membranes, and swelling of lysosomes. Cellular death is mainly by necrosis. However, apoptosis also contributes as the mitochondria are believed to leak pro-apoptotic enzymes with swelling. Apoptosis is a pathway of cellular death that is induced by a tightly regulated program that uses its own enzymes to degrade the rest of the cell in the hopes of limiting collateral tissue damage.
Document 11 (Title: Biochemistry, Extrinsic Pathway of Apoptosis -- Fundamentals): Apoptosis represents an ATP-requiring pathway inducing programmed-cell death and is a requirement for viability. The Greek term apoptosis was initially attributed to this pathway to describe the “falling off of petals from flowers, or leaves from trees.” [2]
Document 12 (Title: Programmed cell death: concept, mechanism and control.): Programmed cell death or apoptosis occurs under physiological conditions as a result of physiological effectors. It is a relatively slower process and requires active participation of the cell in the suicidal mechanism. Apoptosis is controlled by precise intrinsic genetic programme and may be induced by almost all those stimuli causing necrosis. The role played by the intensity in determining the death process and the underlying mechanism is imperfectly understood. Morphologically apoptotic cells appear as small condensed body. The chromatin is dense and fragmented, packed into compact membrane-bound bodies together with randomly distributed cell organelles. The plasma membrane loses its characteristic architecture and shows extensive blebbing. It buds off projections so that the whole cell may split into several membrane-bound apoptotic bodies. Significant chemical changes take place in the plasma membrane. This helps in recognition of the apoptotic bodies by phagocytes. At this moment it is unclear if all cells can undergo apoptosis or it is a characteristic of only some tissues which are predisposed to apoptotic death being directly under the control of hormones or growth factors. Experimental studies aimed at comparison of induction of apoptosis in cells of different origin are warranted to elucidate this point. Biochemically a pre-commitment step for induction of death programmation through macromolecular synthesis is essential for most systems. The double-stranded linker DNA between nucleosomes is cleaved at regular inter-nucleosomal sites through the action of a Ca2+, Mg(2+)-sensitive neutral endonuclease. Zinc is a potent inhibitor of the enzyme. Calcium probably plays a key controlling role in activation of the enzyme since prevention of Ca2+ increase prevents endonuclease activation. It is becoming evident that signal transduction through appropriate receptors control the Ca2+ flux in the cells. Most apoptotic cells require synthesis of RNA and proteins. Delay or abrogation of apoptosis by inhibition of macromolecular synthesis is well known. The dying cells show high mRNA levels for several enzymes. Several degradative enzymes become active. Regulatory proteins maintain control over the apoptotic cascade. At the molecular level, search has been initiated for the mammalian equivalents of the cell death (ced) gene. Activation of several specific genes is indicated. Specific expression of cell death-associated gene products (e.g. TRPM-2/SGP-2) has been reported in several unrelated apoptotic cell systems. Sequential induction of c-fos, c-myc and 70 kDa heat shock protein is reported. Studies demonstrate that certain genes must remain in a transcriptionally active demethylated state during programmed cell death. Recent evidences clearly indicate that apoptosis may be positively or negatively modulated by certain genes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
Document 13 (Title: Cell_Biology_Alberts): The growth, development, and maintenance of multicellular organisms depend not only on the production of cells but also on mechanisms to destroy them. The maintenance of tissue size, for example, requires that cells die at the same rate as they are produced. During development, carefully orchestrated patterns of cell death help determine the size and shape of limbs and other tissues. Cells also die when they become damaged or infected, ensuring that they are removed before they threaten the health of the organism. In these and most other cases, cell death is not a random process but occurs by a programmed sequence of molecular events, in which the cell systematically destroys itself from within and is then eaten by other cells, leaving no trace. In most cases, this programmed cell death occurs by a process called apoptosis—from the Greek word meaning “falling off,” as leaves from a tree.
Document 14 (Title: Bacterial Sepsis -- Histopathology): The cellular and tissue changes induced by a shock are essentially those also seen in hypoxic injury states. As oxygen tension within the cell decreases, there is a loss of oxidative phosphorylation and decreased generation of ATP. The sodium pump fails, and potassium is lost with a concurrent influx of sodium and water, causing the cell to swell in size.

Document 15 (Title: Programmed cell death): Mitochondriate eukaryotic cells live poised between life and death, because mitochondria still retain their repertoire of molecules that can trigger cell suicide. It is not clear why apoptotic machinery is maintained in the extant unicellular organisms. This process has now been evolved to happen only when programmed. to cells (such as feedback from neighbors, stress or DNA damage), mitochondria release caspase activators that trigger the cell-death-inducing biochemical cascade. As such, the cell suicide mechanism is now crucial to all of our lives. Programmed death of entire organisms Clinical significance ABL The BCR-ABL oncogene has been found to be involved in the development of cancer in humans. c-Myc c-Myc is involved in the regulation of apoptosis via its role in downregulating the Bcl-2 gene.
