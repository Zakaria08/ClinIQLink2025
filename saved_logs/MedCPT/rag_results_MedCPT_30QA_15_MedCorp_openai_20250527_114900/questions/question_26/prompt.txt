Document 2 (Title: Production of vitamins, coenzymes and related biochemicals by biotechnological processes.): Vitamins and related biofactors belong to those few chemicals with a direct positive appeal to people. There is indeed a large need for extra vitamins, other than those derived from plant and animal food sources, due to unbalanced food habits or processing, food shortage or disease. Added vitamins are now either prepared chemically or biotechnologically via fermentation or bioconversion processes. Several vitamins and related biofactors are now only or mainly produced chemically (vitamin A, cholecalciferol (D3), tocopherol (E), vitamin K2, thiamine (B1), niacin (PP or B3), pantothenic acid (B5), pyridoxine (B6), biotin (H or B8), folic acid (B9) or via extraction processes (beta-carotene or provitamin A, provitamin D3, tocopherol, vitamin F-group). However, for several of these compounds microbiological or algal methods also exist or are rapidly emerging. Others are produced practically exclusively via fermentation (ergosterol or provitamin D2, riboflavin (B2), cyanocobalamin (B12), orotic acid (B13), vitamin F-group, ATP, nucleosides, coenzymes, etc. or via microalgal culture (beta-carotene, E, F). Both chemical and microbial processes are run industrially for vitamin B2 while vitamin C (ascorbic acid) is produced via a combination of chemical reactions and fermentation processes. A survey is given here of the current state of vitamin production, with emphasis on developments and strategies for improved biotechnological production and its significance, as compared to existing chemical processes. The screening or construction of vitamin hyperproducing microbial strains is a difficult task; pathway elucidation and metabolic (de)regulation need further study; r-DNA technology has only recently been introduced; improved fermentation processes and immobilised biocatalysts bioconversions for the synthesis of chiral vitamin compounds or intermediates or derivatives are gaining importance; the recovery and purification of these vitamin compounds from their fermentation broths remains equally complex.
Document 3 (Title: Vitamin): and four tocotrienols. Some sources list fourteen vitamins, by including choline, but major health organizations list thirteen: vitamin A (as all-trans-retinol, all-trans-retinyl-esters, as well as all-trans-beta-carotene and other provitamin A carotenoids), vitamin B1 (thiamine), vitamin B2 (riboflavin), vitamin B3 (niacin), vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid), vitamin B6 (pyridoxine), vitamin B7 (biotin), vitamin B9 (folic acid or folate), vitamin B12 (cobalamins), vitamin C (ascorbic acid), vitamin D (calciferols), vitamin E (tocopherols and tocotrienols), and vitamin K (phylloquinone and menaquinones).
Document 4 (Title: Nutrition: Micronutrient Intake, Imbalances, and Interventions -- Definition/Introduction -- Water-Soluble Vitamins): Vitamin B12 (cobalamin): Vitamin B12 is a water-soluble vitamin that is a cofactor in synthesizing DNA, fatty acids, and myelin, as well as erythropoiesis and the development of the nervous system. [7] [29] Bacteria synthesize cobalamin in the gastrointestinal tract of animals, and the host later absorbs it. Because vitamin B12 is concentrated in animal tissues, it is virtually found only in animal products such as meat, dairy, and eggs. [29] [30] The RDA of vitamin B12 for adults is 2.4 mcg/d. [31]
Document 5 (Title: Nutrient): Vitamins Vitamins are organic molecules essential for an organism that are not classified as amino acids or fatty acids. They commonly function as enzymatic cofactors, metabolic regulators or antioxidants. Humans require thirteen vitamins in their diet, most of which are actually groups of related molecules (e.g. vitamin E includes tocopherols and tocotrienols): vitamins A, C, D, E, K, thiamine (B1), riboflavin (B2), niacin (B3), pantothenic acid (B5), vitamin B6 (e.g., pyridoxine), biotin (B7), folate (B9), and cobalamin (B12). The requirement for vitamin D is conditional, as people who get sufficient exposure to ultraviolet light, either from the sun or an artificial source, synthesize vitamin D in the skin. Minerals
Document 6 (Title: Vitamin B12 metabolism in the fruit bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus). The induction of vitamin B12 deficiency and its effect on folate levels.): 1. Vitamin B12 metabolism was studied in bats of the species Rousettus aegyptiacus, which live on an all-fruit diet in the wild. 2. There was a wide range in values for the serum vitamin B12 concentration of newly captured bats, but bats captured in the early spring had significantly higher mean serum vitamin B12 levels than bats captured in the early autumn. 3. There was an exponential decrease in serum vitamin B12 concentration with time in captivity for bats fed on a vitamin B12-deficient, all-fruit diet; the biological half-life was 80 d in serum, 109 d in liver and 164 d in kidney. 4. The main storage organ for vitamin B12 in the bats was the liver, mean content 1067 ng vitamin B12. After 50 d, injected [57Co]cyanocobalamin had equilibrated with body vitamin B12 stores, and 17% of the retained radioactivity was present in the liver. From these results it was calculated that the total body vitamin B12 content of the bat was c. 6500 ng. 5. The biological half-life of injected [57Co]cyanocobalamin was 70--88 d and the calculated daily requirement was 50--60 ng (0-2 mug/kg body-weight per d). 6. As serum vitamin B12 levels decreased, serum folate levels increased. The erythrocyte folate concentration increased significantly after 130 d on the all-fruit diet and then decreased to the initial values after 190 d. 7. Vitamin B12 metabolism in the fruit bat is similar in many respects to that of man, but on a 'weight-for-weight' basis the bat has a 5- to 15-fold greater requirement for this vitamin. 8. Vitamin B12 deficiency may be induced fairly rapidly in fruit bats fed on an all-fruit diet.
Document 7 (Title: Vitamin D -- Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes): Very few foods are a natural source of vitamin D. These include oily fish such as salmon, mackerel, and sardines. Foods fortified with vitamin D are milk and orange juice, and some bread and cereals. An important source of oral vitamin D is vitamin D supplements, which are available both over the counter and through prescription. These are available in strengths of 1000 IU, 2000 IU, 5000 IU, and 50,000 IU, which are available only through prescription. [12] [13] By engaging in interprofessional collaboration, the healthcare team can ensure patients are adequately supplied with this vital nutrient and drive their patients to better health. [Level 5]
Document 8 (Title: Vitamin deficiencies and public interventions in the Federal Republic of Germany.): Vitamin supply of adults in the Federal Republic of Germany is - on the average of the population - satisfactory; i.e. the great majority of test persons who underwent biochemical tests (in each case more than 70%) has been found to show at least satisfactory values of vitamin supply with the usual diet. Measuring values of folic acid, thiamin and vitamin B6 were most frequent in the critical range. Uncertain supply with riboflavin, vitamin A and vitamin C has been found in some age and professional groups only; supply with vitamin B12, vitamin E and niacin was not certain in some exceptional cases only. Groups of above-average risk of uncertain vitamin supply so far are young women (18-24 years) and senior men (above 65 years). The pattern of supply gaps is clearly different: in young women, uncertain supply includes folic acid, riboflavin, vitamin B6 and (as the only group) vitamin E; in older men, it includes vitamin C, vitamin A and riboflavin). The educational level is another important factor of influence which has to be taken into account. This is pleasant finding because it gives reason to assume that improved capability to inform oneself leads, at least in part of the population, to a more balanced diet. In cases of lower educational levels, on the other hand, the interest in questions of health and maintenance of health is much lower. This also becomes manifest in a clearly reduced readiness to participate in nutritional inquiries.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Document 9 (Title: Dietary supplement): (e.g. vitamin E includes tocopherols and tocotrienols, vitamin K includes vitamin K1 and K2). The list: vitamins A, C, D, E, K, Thiamine (B1), Riboflavin (B2), Niacin (B3), Pantothenic Acid (B5), Vitamin B6, Biotin (B7), Folate (B9) and Vitamin B12. Vitamin intake below recommended amounts can result in signs and symptoms associated with vitamin deficiency. There is little evidence of benefit when vitamins are consumed as a dietary supplement by those who are healthy and have a nutritionally adequate diet.
Document 10 (Title: Vitamin D -- Administration): Very few foods are a natural source of vitamin D. These include oily fish such as salmon, mackerel, and sardines. Foods fortified with vitamin D are milk and orange juice (100 units per 8 ounce serving) and some bread and cereals. An important source of oral vitamin D is vitamin D supplements, which are available both over the counter and through prescription. These are available in strengths of 1000 IU, 2000 IU, 5000 IU, and 50,000 IU, which are available only through prescription. [9]
Document 11 (Title: Vitamin): Intake Sources For the most part, vitamins are obtained from the diet, but some are acquired by other means: for example, microorganisms in the gut flora produce vitamin K and biotin; and one form of vitamin D is synthesized in skin cells when they are exposed to a certain wavelength of ultraviolet light present in sunlight. Humans can produce some vitamins from precursors they consume: for example, vitamin A is synthesized from beta carotene; and niacin is synthesized from the amino acid tryptophan. Vitamin C can be synthesized by some species but not by others. Vitamin B12 is the only vitamin or nutrient not available from plant sources. The Food Fortification Initiative lists countries which have mandatory fortification programs for vitamins folic acid, niacin, vitamin A and vitamins B1, B2 and B12. Deficient intake
Document 12 (Title: Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin) -- Continuing Education Activity): Riboflavin, also known as vitamin B2, is a water-soluble vitamin that belongs to the vitamin B complex group. Clinicians frequently prescribe riboflavin as part of a combined formulation with other B complex vitamins as a prophylactic supplement to manage and treat vitamin B2 deficiency. Riboflavin deficiency is a rare condition as it is present in various food choices. However, individuals who follow a diet low in meat and milk, which are considered the best sources of riboflavin, and certain specific groups of people, such as pregnant women, children, and athletes, may be more susceptible to this deficiency. Milk and dairy products are rich in riboflavin and vitamin D. Dairy consumption is the primary source of vitamin D in Western diets. This is why riboflavin deficiency is rare among water-soluble vitamins.

Which of the following statements about vitamin C is correct? Vitamin C is: A. a competitor of iron absorption in the intestine. B. a fat-soluble vitamin with a 3-month supply typically stored in adipose tissue. C. a coenzyme in several enzymic reactions such as the hydroxylation of proline. D. required for the cross-linking of collagen. Q2. In contrast to the microcytic anemia characteristic of iron deficiency (common in older adults), a macrocytic anemia is seen with deficiencies of vitamin B12 and/or folic acid. These vitamin deficiencies are also common in older adults. Which of the following statements concerning these vitamins is correct? A. An inability to absorb B12 results in pernicious anemia. B. Both vitamins cause changes in gene expression. C. Folic acid plays a key role in energy metabolism in most cells.
Document 14 (Title: Biochemistry, Nutrients -- Introduction): Nutrients are chemical substances required by the body to sustain basic functions and are optimally obtained by eating a balanced diet. There are six major classes of nutrients essential for human health: carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, vitamins, minerals, and water. Carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins are considered macronutrients and serve as a source of energy. Water is required in large amounts but does not yield energy. Vitamins and minerals are considered micronutrients and play essential roles in metabolism. Vitamins are organic micronutrients classified as either water-soluble or fat-soluble. The essential water-soluble vitamins include vitamins B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, B7, B9, B12, and C. The essential fat-soluble vitamins include vitamins A, E, D, and K. Minerals are inorganic micronutrients. Minerals can classify as macrominerals or microminerals. Macrominerals are required in amounts greater than 100 mg per day and include calcium, phosphorous, magnesium, sodium, potassium, and chloride. Sodium, potassium, and chloride are also electrolytes. Microminerals are those nutrients required in amounts less than 100 mg per day and include iron, copper, zinc, selenium, and iodine. This article will review the following biochemical aspects of the essential nutrients: fundamentals, cellular, molecular, function, testing, and clinical significance. [1] [2]
Document 15 (Title: Vitamin D Toxicity -- Epidemiology): According to the latest report from America's Poison Centers (APC), there were 11,718 cases of vitamin D exposure recorded in the National Poison Data System. More than half of these cases were in children younger than 5 years. The vast majority of cases were from unintentional exposures. The total number of vitamin D toxicity cases was greater than the total number of vitamin (vitamins B, A, C, and E) toxicity cases combined. This illustrates the widespread use of vitamin D supplements. [13]
