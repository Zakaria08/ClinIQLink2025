Document 1 (Title: Evaluation of Visual Acuity -- Clinical Significance): Although conversion tables are available to convert Snellen fraction to logMAR, such conversion may falsely measure the visual acuity to be worse compared to directly measuring the visual acuity with logMAR charts, specifically in individuals with low vision. Therefore, caution should be exercised while analyzing converted Snellen values to logMAR. [32] [33] [34] [35] (see Table 2. LogMAR Equivalencies for Snellen Visual Acuity Measurements). The repeatability of visual acuity measurements using the LogMAR chart was noted to be 2 times of the Snellen chart. [28] [36] LogMAR charts and Glasgow acuity cards may be more sensitive to interocular differences in visual acuity compared to Snellen charts or traditional single-letter acuity tests in young children and, hence, may be more sensitive in detecting amblyopia. [37] Thus, there may be a poor or unacceptable agreement between the Snellen chart and the current gold standard LogMAR chart. [28] Few authors recommend that the time may have come to confine Snellen charts to the annals of history. [36] Snellen chart, by the inherent restriction of the stimulus size, has the effect of truncating the upper limit of the scale, producing, in statistical terms, an incomplete distribution, and the irregular progression of letter size along with the design of the chart may not allow parametric statistics to be employed. [28] [38] Therefore, the conversion of Snellen visual acuity to logMAR using a conversion chart and subsequent analysis of the data has been discouraged. [28] Data are better measured using LogMAR charts for a reliable analysis of visual acuity measurements. [36] However, despite these limitations, the Snellen chart is present in many clinics due to its ease of use and the familiarity it offers compared to the LogMAR chart. Some journals prefer the term corrected distance visual acuity over best-corrected visual acuity. Most journals need the authors to report the mean visual acuity and range of visual acuity in Snellen format for better comprehension. LogMAR values should be used to measure mean visual acuity rather than decimal or MAR values. [39]
Document 2 (Title: [Amblyopia: reading speed in comparison with visual acuity for gratings, single Landolt Cs and series Landolt Cs].): In the treatment of amblyopia in preschool children, a means of predicting later reading ability would be helpful. This prediction might be possible using a test for visual acuity where the results correlate with reading ability in adult patients with amblyopia. We measured the following four parameters in 18 experienced readers with strabismic amblyopia: (1) time spent reading ten lines of a standard text in one of three magnifications, (2) visual acuity for gratings, (3) visual acuity for single Landolt Cs, and (4) visual acuity for crowded Landolt Cs (one Landolt C flanked by two full rings on each side each at a distance of 2.6 min of arc). The reading text was presented on paper at a distance of 40 cm; the subject had a choice of three magnifications. The acuity tests were generated by a computer on a VDU at 4.6 m. The relative impairment of the amblyopic eye was defined as the quotient between the performance of the amblyopic and the good eye. In addition, the difference between the times spent reading the ten lines with the amblyopic and with the good eye was calculated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Document 3 (Title: Visual acuity): The precise distance at which acuity is measured is not important as long as it is sufficiently far away and the size of the optotype on the retina is the same. That size is specified as a visual angle, which is the angle, at the eye, under which the optotype appears. For 6/6 = 1.0 acuity, the size of a letter on the Snellen chart or Landolt C chart is a visual angle of 5 arc minutes (1 arc min = 1/60 of a degree). By the design of a typical optotype (like a Snellen E or a Landolt C), the critical gap that needs to be resolved is 1/5 this value, i.e., 1 arc min. The latter is the value used in the international definition of visual acuity:

Document 5 (Title: [The Teller Acuity Card Test: possibilities and limits of clinical use].): The Teller Acuity Card test was used to examine 49 normal children, 77 with strabismus, 9 with anisometropia and 19 with various organic ocular diseases. The vision of some of these children was also tested with the Landolt C and fixation preference tests. A comparison of the three tests showed that strabismic amblyopia is not reliably detected with the Teller Acuity Cards. On the other hand, this test appears to be a good one for detecting loss of acuity due to ocular diseases.
Document 6 (Title: Neurology_Adams): Impairment of visual function, expressed as defects in acuity and alterations of visual fields, obviously stands as the most important symptom of eye disease. A number of terms are commonly used to describe visual loss. Amaurosis is a general term that refers to partial or complete loss of sight. Amblyopia refers to any monocular deficit in vision that occurs in the presence of normal ocular structures. A major cause of amblyopia is the suppression by the brain of vision from one eye during early childhood caused by either strabismus, anisometropia (a significant difference in refractive error), or by media opacities. Nyctalopia is a term for poor twilight or night vision and is associated with extreme myopia, cataracts, vitamin A deficiency, retinitis pigmentosa, and, often, color blindness. There are also a number of positive visual symptoms that are named based on their characteristics, phosphenes, migrainous scintillations, visual illusions, and hallucinations. Irritation,
Document 7 (Title: Amblyopia): Diagnosis Amblyopia is diagnosed by identifying low visual acuity in one or both eyes, out of proportion to the structural abnormality of the eye and excluding other visual disorders as causes for the lowered visual acuity. It can be defined as an interocular difference of two lines or more in acuity (e.g. on Snellen chart) when the eye optics are maximally corrected. In young children, visual acuity is difficult to measure and can be estimated by observing the reactions of the patient when one eye is covered, including observing the patient's ability to follow objects with one eye.
Document 8 (Title: Visual Acuity -- Equipment): Depending on the patient's vision and ability, one or more of the following may be required: Optotype chart (e.g., Snellen, tumbling E, Landolt C, Allen, or LogMAR chart) Occluder card or patch Pinhole occluder Penlight/flashlight [6]
Document 9 (Title: Visual acuity): Expression Visual acuity is often measured according to the size of letters viewed on a Snellen chart or the size of other symbols, such as Landolt Cs or the E Chart. In some countries, acuity is expressed as a vulgar fraction, and in some as a decimal number. Using the metre as a unit of measurement, (fractional) visual acuity is expressed relative to 6/6. Otherwise, using the foot, visual acuity is expressed relative to 20/20. For all practical purposes, 20/20 vision is equivalent to 6/6. In the decimal system, acuity is defined as the reciprocal value of the size of the gap (measured in arc minutes) of the smallest Landolt C, the orientation of which can be reliably identified. A value of 1.0 is equal to 6/6.
Document 10 (Title: Anisometropia -- Evaluation): Amblyopia can be detected by measuring the natural and corrected visual acuity with normal or specific optotype charts, such as Landolt C or tumbling "E" charts, picture charts, or Tellers tables, according to the patient's age, compliance, and intellectual capability (See various optotype chart images). The refraction must be measured in cycloplegic conditions.
Document 11 (Title: Pediatrics_Nelson): The most common cause of severe visual impairment in children is retinopathy of prematurity (see Chapter 61). Congenital cataracts may lead to significant amblyopia. Cataracts also are associated with other ocular abnormalities and developmental disabilities. Amblyopia is a pathologic alteration of the visual system characterized by a reduction in visual acuity in one or both eyes with no clinically apparent organic abnormality that completely accounts for the visual loss. Amblyopia is due to a distortion of the normal clearly formed retinal image (from congenital cataracts or severe refractive errors); abnormal binocular interaction between the eyes as one eye competitively inhibits the other (strabismus); or a combination of both mechanisms. Albinism, hydrocephalus, congenital cytomegalovirus infection, and birth asphyxia are other significant contributors to blindness in children.
Document 12 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): CHAPTER 39 Disorders of the Eye PART 2 Cardinal Manifestations and Presentation of Diseases FIguRE 39-1 The Rosenbaum card is a miniature, scale version of the Snellen chart for testing visual acuity at near. When the visual acuity is recorded, the Snellen distance equivalent should bear a nota-tion indicating that vision was tested at near, not at 6 m (20 ft), or else the Jaeger number system should be used to report the acuity.
Document 13 (Title: Neurology_Adams): In the measurement of distance visual acuity the Snellen chart, which contains letters (or numbers or pictures) arranged in rows of decreasing size, is used (Fig. 12-1A). Each eye is tested separately at a distance of 20 ft. Spectacles should be worn if they are required for distance. The letter at the top of the chart subtends 5 min of an arc at a distance of 200 ft (or roughly 60 m). The patient follows rows of letters that can normally be read at lesser distances. Acuity is reported as a nonmathematical fraction that represents the distance at which the patient has read the chart and the distance at which a person with normal vision would be able to read a letter of the same size. Thus, at distance of 20 ft if the patient can read only the top letter on the chart, which would be normally be visible at 200 ft, the acuity is expressed as 20/200 (if the distance is measured in meters, it is 6/60). If the patient’s eyesight is normal, the visual acuity will equal 20/20, or 6/6,
Document 14 (Title: Visual Acuity -- Introduction): In the 1800s, there was a move to standardize visual testing, which led to the formation of several visual acuity charts with different optotypes. The first and still most widely used today is the Snellen chart. Other testing charts developed around that time include the Tumbling E chart, Landolt C chart, and Allen chart. More recently, the LogMAR chart (also known as ETDRS chart) has gained favor. The LogMAR chart provides more accurate results when compared to other visual acuity charts, and the results are more easily used in vision analysis, making it the preferred chart in clinical studies.

Document 15 (Title: On the relationship between strabismic amblyopia and eccentric fixation.): Landolt C and grating acuity are compared with that normally expected of the eccentric fixation region for 10 strabismic amblyopes. The findings suggest that 2 populations of amblyopes exist. For some amblyopes visual function is that predicted of the eccentric region used for fixation, whereas for other amblyopes there is a further pathological reduction in visual function. These findings may have an important bearing on the type of orthoptic treatment used for amblyopia.
