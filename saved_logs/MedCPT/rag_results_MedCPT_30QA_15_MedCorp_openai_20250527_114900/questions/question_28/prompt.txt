Document 1 (Title: Cervical Cancer -- Evaluation): Colposcopy is the diagnostic procedure of choice for evaluating abnormal cytology and/or persistent high-risk HPV infection. The American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology (ASCCP) has issued guidance on procedural indications, and their recommended algorithms are considered standard of care. Multiple colposcopic-guided biopsies and endocervical sampling are often indicated, except during pregnancy. [21] Abnormal colposcopic findings may include acetowhite color change with the application of acetic acid, rich vascularity, atypical vessels, mosaicism, and punctation (see Image. Invasive Cervical Cancer).
Document 2 (Title: [Colpo-cyto-histological correlations in intraepithelial lesions of the uterine cervix].): The aim of this study was to assess the clinical efficiency of colposcopic findings as diagnostic tests for intraepithelial lesion using the analysis of colpo-cyto-histological correlations. The results of 3340 colposcopic tests performed in the Colposcopy Unit of the Second Clinic of Obstetrics and Gynecology between March 1990 and May 1991 were analysed, taking into account 326 (9.7%) cases of Abnormal Transformation Zone (ANTZ). The colpo-histological correlation in ANTZ 1 cases (52 cases of white epithelium, 92 standard mosaic, 42 standard dotted and 61 mixed cases) was 65.2% (52.3%) for HPV; 12.9% for CIN). The colpo-histological correlation in ANTZ 2 cases (30 cases of thickened white epithelium, 5 irregular mosaic, 4 irregular dotted, 2 atypical vessels, 4 thickened gland outlets and 6 mixed cases) was 70.5% (43.3% for HPV; 27.2% for CIN an and Ca). In this retrospective study colposcopy showed a diagnostic accuracy of 64.6% in the cases examined and played a decisive role in the diagnosis of intraepithelial lesions of the uterine cervix.
Document 3 (Title: Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia): Colposcopy can be painful and so researchers have tried to find which pain relief is best for women with CIN to use. Research suggests that compared to a placebo, the injection of a local anaesthetic and vasoconstrictor (medicine that causes blood vessels to narrow) into the cervix may lower blood loss and pain during colposcopy. HPV testing can identify most of the high-risk HPV types responsible for CIN. HPV screening happens either as a co-test with the Pap smear or can be done after a Pap smear showing abnormal cells, called reflex testing.Frequency of screening changes based on guidelines from the Society of Lower Genital Tract Disorders (ASCCP). The World Health Organization also has screening and treatment guidelines for precancerous cervical lesions and prevention of cervical cancer. Primary prevention HPV vaccination is the approach to primary prevention of both CIN and cervical cancer.
Document 4 (Title: Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia): Classification Historically, abnormal changes of cervical epithelial cells were described as mild, moderate, or severe epithelial dysplasia. In 1988 the National Cancer Institute developed "The Bethesda System for Reporting Cervical/Vaginal Cytologic Diagnoses." This system provides a uniform way to describe abnormal epithelial cells and determine specimen quality, thus providing clear guidance for clinical management. These abnormalities were classified as squamous or glandular and then further classified by the stage of dysplasia: atypical cells, mild, moderate, severe, and carcinoma. Depending on several factors and the location of the lesion, CIN can start in any of the three stages and can either progress or regress. The grade of squamous intraepithelial lesion can vary. CIN is classified in grades:
Document 5 (Title: Colposcopy in women with papillomavirus lesions of the uterine cervix.): Colposcopic examinations for human papillomavirus lesions were performed in 271 women, some of whom had developed concomitant cervical intraepithelial neoplasia since 1981. The colposcopic appearance was classified into one of the following categories: normal, punctate, mosaic, warty, leukoplakial, or combination, and was related to findings in Papanicolaou smears and punch biopsy specimens. There was a good correlation between the colposcopic appearance and the findings in the Papanicolaou smears and punch biopsy specimens, facilitating the diagnosis of the lesions. The accuracy of colposcopy in disclosing the atypias varied according to the growth pattern of the papillomavirus lesions, with the most accurate (100%) in cases of papillomatous condylomas, and the least accurate (50%) in the inverted lesions. White epithelium and combination patterns were most frequently associated with the papillomavirus lesions and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, as evidenced by both cytology and biopsy. During the follow-up, normal colposcopic appearance increased from 32 to 50%, reflecting the established spontaneous regression of a certain percentage of the cervical lesions, or their regression as a result of biopsy. The results are discussed in terms of the mutually complementary roles of colposcopy, cytology, and biopsy, and in view of the clinical behavior of cervical papillomavirus lesions. Colposcopy is mandatory for adequate prospective follow-up of these patients but should not replace cytology and punch biopsy.

This pattern develops as islands of dysplastic epithelium proliferate and push the ends of the superficial blood vessels away, creating a pattern that looks like mosaic tiles.

Document 7 (Title: Gynecology_Novak): Figure 19.10 Human papillomavirus (HPV)/cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2 (CIN 2) presents as a white lesion with surface spicules. Mosaic Terminal capillaries surrounding roughly circular or polygonal-shaped blocks of acetowhite epithelium crowded together are called mosaic because their appearance is similar to mosaic tile (Fig. 19.11). These vessels form a “basket” around the blocks of abnormal epithelium. They may arise from a coalescence of many terminal punctate vessels or from the vessels that surround the cervical gland openings (5). Mosaicism tends to be associated with higher-grade lesions and CIN 2 (Fig. 19.12) and CIN 3 (Fig. 19.13). Atypical Vascular Pattern Atypical vascular patterns are characteristic of invasive cervical cancer and include looped vessels, branching vessels, and reticular vessels.
Document 8 (Title: Gynecology_Novak): Abnormal Blood Vessels Abnormal vessels may be looped, branched, or reticular. Abnormal looped vessels are the most common colposcopic finding and arise from the punctated and mosaic vessels present in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). As the neoplastic growth process proceeds and the need for oxygen and nutrition increases, angiogenesis occurs as a result of tumor and local tissue production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF),
Document 9 (Title: [Epithelial dysplasia and invasive carcinoma of oral cavity showing punctation and atypical vessels].): We have experienced epithelial dysplasia and invasive carcinoma of oral cavity, showing punctation and mosaic like atypical vessels confirmed by usual photographing. Case 1: 42-year-old man. After resection of tongue leukoplakia, the punctation appeared in the distal region of resected wound. Pathological findings were epithelial dysplasia, and expansion of capillaries in the stromal papillae were close to the surface. Case 2: 55-year-old woman. Punctation and mosaic like atypical vessels were recognized in the buccal mucosa, extending from the gingival carcinoma. Pathological findings were epithelial dysplasia and carcinoma in situ in punctation, and early invasive carcinoma in mosaic. There were irregularly expanded capillaries in the stromal papillae being close to the surface at both mosaic and punctation area. Although punctation, atypical vessels and mosaic are the colposcopic findings of uterine cervical cancer, these findings may become diagnostic point of early oral cancer.
Document 10 (Title: Cervical Squamous Cell Carcinoma -- Evaluation -- Colposcopy): Colposcopic reporting is as follows: Satisfactory Colposcopic Examination: columnar epithelium, squamous epithelium, and squamocolumnar junction visualized. Unsatisfactory: squamocolumnar junction not adequately visualized. In such a case, a specimen for biopsy can be collected by endocervical curettage. Abnormal Findings: Mosaics, punctuations, acetowhite areas, keratosis, atypical vessels, negative iodine area, raised area, etc
Document 11 (Title: Gynecology_Novak): Figure 19.8 Colposcopy of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2 (CIN 2) associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection of the cervix. Punctation Dilated capillaries terminating on the surface appear from the ends as a collection of dots and are referred to as punctation (Fig. 19.9). When these vessels occur in a well-demarcated area of acetowhite epithelium, they indicate an abnormal epithelium— most often CIN (5) (Fig. 19.10). The punctate vessels are formed as the metaplastic epithelium migrates over the columnar villi. Normally, the capillary regresses; however, when CIN occurs, the capillary persists and appears more prominent. Figure 19.9 Diagram of punctation. The central capillaries of the columnar villi are preserved and produce the punctate vessels on the surface. Figure 19.10 Human papillomavirus (HPV)/cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2 (CIN 2) presents as a white lesion with surface spicules.
Document 12 (Title: Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia -- Treatment / Management): As stated earlier, CIN -2 or higher requires treatment. Treatment is also recommended when there is more than one degree of difference between pap results and biopsy results. For example, if the pap smear is high-grade intraepithelial lesion (HGSIL), but the biopsy is negative, the potential reasons are a misread of the specimen, or there was a missed a lesion at the time of colposcopy. In this case, a diagnostic excisional procedure is the preferred mode of treatment because it is both therapeutic and diagnostic. The margins of the cervical specimen may then undergo evaluation for complete removal of any abnormal cells. [1]
Document 13 (Title: Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia): Like other intraepithelial neoplasias, CIN is not cancer and is usually curable. Most cases of CIN either remain stable or are eliminated by the person's immune system without need for intervention. However, a small percentage of cases progress to cervical cancer, typically cervical squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), if left untreated. Signs and symptoms There are no specific symptoms of CIN alone. Generally, signs and symptoms of cervical cancer include: abnormal or post-menopausal bleeding abnormal discharge changes in bladder or bowel function pelvic pain on examination abnormal appearance or palpation of cervix. HPV infection of the vulva and vagina can cause genital warts or be asymptomatic.
Document 14 (Title: Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia): CIN is classified in grades: Changes in Terminology The College of American Pathology and the American Society of Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology came together in 2012 to publish changes in terminology to describe HPV-associated squamous lesions of the anogenital tract as LSIL or HSIL as follows below: CIN 1 is referred to as LSIL. CIN 2 that is negative for p16, a marker for high-risk HPV, is referred to as LSIL. Those that are p16-positive are referred to as HSIL. CIN 3 is referred to as HSIL. Screening
Document 15 (Title: Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia -- Evaluation): Colposcopy with directed biopsy is the preferred method for evaluation of an abnormal pap smear result. "Co-testing" combines cytology and HPV testing for high-risk types, but is still considered screening. The diagnosis ultimately requires tissue sampling. There are exceptions to this rule:
