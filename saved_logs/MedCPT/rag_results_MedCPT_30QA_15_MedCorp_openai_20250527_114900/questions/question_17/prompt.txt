Document 1 (Title: Treatment of localized prostatic cancer.): Discovery of a localized prostatic cancer frequently creates a therapeutic dilemma. A significant number of patients do well for an extended period of time without treatment, while others suffer rapid tumor progression and death from prostatic cancer. Without treatment nearly one third of patients with stage B prostatic cancer can be expected to develop distant metastatic disease or death from prostatic cancer within 10 years. In patients who otherwise have a reasonable life expectancy of 10 years or more, aggressive therapy is justified. Long-term disease-free survival has been reported after both radical prostatectomy and external irradiation. The fact that nearly 50% of patients treated with external irradiation for stage B prostatic cancer have positive postirradiation biopsies is of concern, but the impact of this finding on overall survival is yet to be determined. The only randomized prospective study comparing radical prostatectomy with external irradiation showed a statistically significant decrease in the time to Nevertheless, as evidenced by the National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Panel, further randomized prospective trials are needed to determine the relative value of radical prostatectomy versus external irradiation for localized prostatic cancer. For the forseeable future, definitive scientific data on which to base treatment recommendations will not be available. Therefore, patients should be well informed of the various treatment options available, and the wishes of the patient are paramount. The clinician's roles are to interpret the data, present it in a meaningful manner to patients, be guided in discussions by patient preferences, and make recommendations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Document 2 (Title: Prostate Cancer -- Medical Oncology -- Aggressive Prostate Cancer): Aggressive disease in prostate cancer is typically defined as either locally advanced, a higher Gleason score (Gleason 4+4=8 or higher), or a rapid PSA doubling time of 10 months or less. Treatment for aggressive prostate cancers may involve radical prostatectomy, radiation therapy, HIFU, cryosurgery, hormonal therapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, radiopharmaceuticals, or some combination of these. Early use of combinatorial therapies is helpful in many patients presenting with aggressive or advanced, localized disease. [26] [296] [321]
Document 3 (Title: Prostate cancer): Many cases are managed with active surveillance or watchful waiting. Other treatments may include a combination of surgery, radiation therapy, hormone therapy, or chemotherapy. Tumors limited to the prostate may be curable. Pain medications, bisphosphonates, and targeted therapy, among others, may be useful. Outcomes depend on age, health status and how aggressive and extensive the cancer is. Most men with prostate cancer do not die from it. The United States five-year survival rate is 98%.
Document 4 (Title: Pathology_Robbins): The relatively low rate of mortality in men with prostate cancer is related in part to increased detection of the disease through screening (discussed later), but how effective screening is at saving lives is controversial. This seeming paradox is related to the wide variation in the natural history of prostate cancer, from aggressive and rapidly fatal to indolent disease of no clinical significance. Indeed, prostate carcinoma commonly is found incidentally at autopsy in men dying of other causes, and many more men die with prostate cancer than of prostate cancer. It is not currently possible to identify the tumors that will be “bad actors” with certainty; thus, while some men are no doubt saved by early detection and treatment of their prostate cancers, it is equally certain that others are being “cured” of clinically inconsequential tumors.
Document 5 (Title: Prostate cancer staging): Prostate cancer staging is the process by which physicians categorize the risk of cancer having spread beyond the prostate, or equivalently, the probability of being cured with local therapies such as surgery or radiation. Once patients are placed in prognostic categories, this information can contribute to the selection of an optimal approach to treatment. Prostate cancer stage can be assessed by either clinical or pathological staging methods. Clinical staging usually occurs before the first treatment and tumour presence is determined through imaging and rectal examination, while pathological staging is done after treatment once a biopsy is performed or the prostate is removed by looking at the cell types within the sample.
Document 6 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): boney structures. Modern CT PET scans have a limited role at this point.Treatment for localized prostate cancer is guided by can-cer aggressiveness and patient’s preferences. Active sur-veillance is recommended for patients with low-risk disease grade 1–2, early-stage disease (cT1c), and small volume disease as determined by biopsy. Large prospective cohorts and randomized clinical trials have established the safety of this approach.134,135 The risk of progression to metastatic disease with close follow-up and repeat prostate biopsies is less than 2% in over 12 years. Radical prostatectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection (robotic, laparoscopic, or open), image modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), and brachytherapy are the standard of care for curative treatments. All provide equal cancer specific survival for low and intermediate risk cancers. For higher risk prostate cancer patients, both surgery and IMRT with androgen 8Figure 40-11.

Document 7 (Title: Localized Prostate Cancer -- Treatment / Management -- Deferred Curative Strategy): Recent evidence has demonstrated survival benefits from radiotherapy plus ADT in men who would have been traditionally assigned to watchful waiting when they progress to locally advanced disease. This calls into question the distinction between active surveillance and watchful waiting. For instance, although the risk-benefit analysis at initial presentation with the localized disease might be considered unfavorable in an asymptomatic man with co-morbidities, progression to a more advanced stage (eg, T3 disease from T2) could trigger a more radical approach. This is in line with deferred curative treatment. As such, the key to successful monitoring of localized prostate cancer rests on thorough clinical evaluation and an honest appraisal, with the patient, of goals and priorities. [39]
Document 8 (Title: Localized Prostate Cancer -- Introduction): Men with low-grade tumors rarely die from prostate cancer. They are much more likely to die from other causes first. On the other hand, men with high-grade disease are more likely to die from prostate cancer within ten years without radical treatment. The prognosis of men with intermediate-risk cancer is the most difficult to predict. The perceived increased risk of mortality compared to low-risk disease can often push clinicians towards radical treatment in these cases. Still, such a strategy has been challenged by the findings of studies such as the ProtecT study of treatments for localized prostate cancer. Prognostic markers and scoring will likely be of great interest to this group of patients. [8]
Document 9 (Title: The role of surgery in the treatment of hormone resistant prostatic cancer.): The role of surgery in the treatment of hormone refractory prostatic cancer is extremely limited. Rarely, patients with locally advanced, uncontrollable, non-metastatic prostatic cancer enjoy prolonged survival. However, these patients represent an extremely small percentage of patients with prostatic cancer. Radical surgery should be applied to palliate selected patients with uncontrollable local symptoms. However, prostate cancer rarely behaves in a manner necessitating this type of intervention and thus only rarely do patients require radical surgery for local palliation.
Document 10 (Title: Prostate cancer staging): If treated, patients with low-risk disease are usually treated with active surveillance, prostatectomy, or radiotherapy alone. Patients with intermediate-risk disease are candidates for prostatectomy or radiotherapy and a short duration (less than 6 months) of hormonal ablation (medical castration using a gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog). Although the role of surgery in these patients remains uncertain, those with high-risk disease are usually treated with radiotherapy and a long duration of hormonal ablation. Many high-risk patients are not cured by this treatment, and the search for better treatments in this group is a particularly pressing concern in prostate cancer research.

Document 11 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): The prostate cancer continuum—from the appearance of a preneoplastic and invasive lesion localized to the prostate, to a metastatic lesion that results in symptoms and, ultimately, mortality—can span decades. To facilitate disease management, competing risks are considered in the context of a series of clinical states (Fig. 115-1). The states are defined operationally on the basis of whether or not a cancer diagnosis has been established and, for those with a diagnosis, whether or not metastases are detectable on imaging studies and the measured level of testosterone in the blood. With this approach, an individual resides in only one state and remains in that state until he has progressed. At each assessment, the decision to offer treatment and the specific form of treatment are based on the risk posed by the cancer relative to competing causes of mortality that may be present in that individual. It follows that the more advanced the disease, the greater is the need for treatment.
Document 12 (Title: First_Aid_Step2): Look for metastases with CXR and bone scan (metastatic lesions show an osteoblastic or ↑ bone density). Fully 40% of patients present with metastatic disease at diagnosis. Treatment is controversial, as many cases of prostate cancer are slow to progress. Treatment choice is based on the aggressiveness of the tumor and the patient’s mortality risk. Watchful waiting may be the best approach for elderly patients with low-grade tumors. Radical prostatectomy and radiation therapy (e.g., brachytherapy or external beam) are associated with an ↑ risk of incontinence and/or impotence. PSA, while controversial as a screening test, is used to follow patients post-treatment to evaluate for disease recurrence. Treat metastatic disease with androgen ablation (e.g., GnRH agonists, orchiectomy, ﬂutamide) and chemotherapy.
Document 13 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): around the 5and 8-year survival distributions for the two groups overlapped. A large randomized study comparing early to late hormone treatment (orchiectomy or GnRH analogue) in patients with locally advanced or asymptomatic metastatic disease showed that patients treated early were less likely to progress from M0 to M1 disease, to develop pain, and to die of prostate cancer. This trial was criticized because therapy was delayed “too long” in the late-treatment group. Noteworthy is that the American Society of Clinical Oncology Guidelines recommend deferring treatment until the disease has recurred and the prognosis has been reassessed. These guidelines do not support immediate therapy.
Document 14 (Title: Localized Prostate Cancer -- Treatment / Management): Localized prostate cancer represents a paradox in that when left untreated, it is generally associated with a good prognosis. However, because prostate cancer is a common cause of cancer-related mortality, there is usually significant patient anxiety once the diagnosis is confirmed. All standard treatments carry risks of adverse events that might negatively impact short-, medium-, or long-term quality of life. As such, the clinical approach to managing localized prostate cancer must take into account not only the disease features, such as stage, grade, and volume of cancer detected, but also patient co-morbidities, life expectancy, and priorities.
Document 15 (Title: Localized Prostate Cancer -- Prognosis): Despite being common, prostate cancer has the highest 5-year survival of all cancers at 98%. As previously discussed, localized prostate cancer is frequently indolent and has an excellent prognosis even if left untreated. By definition, patients with high-grade, high-volume cancer are more likely to progress to locally advanced and metastatic disease, but risks can be mitigated by early detection and treatment.
