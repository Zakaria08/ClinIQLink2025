Endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement is now the preferred modality over surgical gastrostomy owing to a less invasive nature and faster time to start feeding. [1] During endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement, a small incision is made over the anterior abdominal wall through which the tube is placed via a push method (the tube inserted percutaneously through the incision) or a pull technique (the tube is pulled out from the stomach through the incision). Once the tube is placed, a fistulous gastrocutaneous tract is formed in about 2-4 weeks. However, in certain conditions such as severe malnutrition, immunocompromised patients, and large ascites, tract maturity is further delayed. If a percutaneous gastrostomy endoscopic (PEG) tube is dislodged within a month after placement, then endoscopic replacement is recommended. However, if the tube is dislodged after 4 to 6 weeks when tract maturity is expected, bedside replacement is usually sufficient. If the tube is dislodged within 4 weeks of initial placement, patients are at significant risk of peritonitis and perforation due to peritoneal\u00a0spillage of gastric contents through the immature track, and replacement should not be attempted without surgical consultation. A blind attempt to re-insert the tube or even foley placement in an immature tract can lead to inadvertent placement of the tube into the peritoneal cavity.

In 1987, we described the three-flap anoplasty for the treatment of rectal prolapse following pull-through operations. Since 1986, we have performed 14 three-flap anoplasties in combination with an anterior perineal rectal pull-through for primary treatment of imperforate anus. The mean age at definitive repair was 4.4 months (range, 0 to 14 months). Eleven of the 14 primary pull-through procedures could be performed through a perineal approach only. There were no deaths. At a mean follow-up of 24.2 months, none of the patients has developed prolapse, and only one has had a temporary stenosis. Three children are already fully continent, and soiling is absent in 12. All have a good sphincter tone. Although it is too early to evaluate long-term results, it appears that the three-flap anoplasty prevents mucosal prolapse through the interposition of a skin-lined anal canal. Moreover, a combination of this technique with the anterior perineal approach provides an excellent exposure with minimal dissection of the perineal and pelvic musculature and allows for easy and safe pull-through of the rectal pouch, making an abdominal counterincision unnecessary in most cases. It reproduces at the same time a normal anatomy while taking advantage of all existing structures.",
