Document 1 (Title: Antiplatelet Therapy Following Ischemic Cerebrovascular Events): Secondary prevention following ischemic stroke represents a crucial intervention to mitigate the substantial risk of recurrent cerebrovascular events, which approaches 10-20% within the first year post-stroke. Antiplatelet agents form the cornerstone of pharmacological prevention for non-cardioembolic ischemic strokes, with several agents demonstrating efficacy through distinct mechanisms of action. Aspirin irreversibly inhibits cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1), preventing thromboxane A2 production and subsequent platelet aggregation. Despite its established benefits in stroke prevention, with relative risk reductions of 15-20% for recurrent events, aspirin allergy presents a significant therapeutic challenge necessitating alternative approaches. Dipyridamole, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, increases intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) in platelets, inhibiting aggregation through a mechanism complementary to aspirin. While extended-release dipyridamole combined with aspirin demonstrates superior efficacy to aspirin monotherapy, this combination offers no advantage in aspirin-allergic patients. Thienopyridines, including clopidogrel and ticlopidine, irreversibly block the P2Y12 adenosine diphosphate (ADP) receptor on platelets, preventing ADP-mediated platelet activation and subsequent cross-linking via glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptors. Clopidogrel has largely supplanted ticlopidine due to its superior safety profile and more convenient dosing. The CAPRIE trial demonstrated clopidogrel's modest superiority over aspirin in reducing composite vascular endpoints in high-risk patients, establishing it as the preferred alternative in aspirin-allergic individuals. As a prodrug requiring hepatic conversion to its active metabolite through cytochrome P450 enzymes, clopidogrel demonstrates variable responsiveness influenced by genetic polymorphisms and drug interactions. Newer agents such as prasugrel and ticagrelor offer more consistent platelet inhibition but remain less extensively studied specifically for stroke prevention.
Document 2 (Title: Statin Therapy and Acute Stroke Outcomes): Statin medications have well-established benefits in cardiovascular disease prevention, though their impact when administered before acute stroke events requires careful analysis. Evidence regarding pretreatment effects in acute stroke demonstrates complex and sometimes counterintuitive patterns challenging simplistic assumptions. Systematic reviews of observational studies initially suggested potential benefits of prestroke statin use, though these findings have not been consistently replicated in prospective investigations with appropriate methodological controls. Analysis of 4,012 ischemic stroke patients from the multicenter VISTA database demonstrated that prestroke statin use had neutral effects on functional outcomes (modified Rankin Scale) when controlling for confounding variables including age, comorbidities, and stroke severity (adjusted OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.84-1.01). Potential mechanisms related to enhanced collateral circulation and neuroprotection documented in laboratory studies have shown limited translation to measurable clinical benefits in comprehensive meta-analyses of patient-level data. Some evidence suggests potential differential effects based on stroke subtype, with possible modest benefits in large-vessel atherosclerotic events but neutral effects in cardioembolic and small-vessel strokes. Hemorrhagic transformation risk appears potentially increased in certain subpopulations with prestroke statin use, particularly with higher intensity regimens, suggesting complex risk-benefit profiles. Continuation of statin therapy following stroke shows more consistent benefits than the pretreatment effect itself, highlighting the importance of post-event management. These collective findings from rigorous clinical investigations suggest that while statin therapy remains essential for long-term secondary prevention, the direct neuroprotective effects of pretreatment on acute stroke severity and immediate functional outcomes appear more limited than initially hypothesized based on observational data and preclinical models.
Document 3 (Title: Nitroglycerin): Nitroglycerin belongs to a group of drugs called nitrates, which includes many other nitrates like isosorbide dinitrate (Isordil) and isosorbide mononitrate (Imdur, Ismo, Monoket).[35] These agents all exert their effect by being converted to nitric oxide in the body by mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH2),[8] and nitric oxide is a potent natural vasodilator. Nitro   bangy stuff Nitroglycerin in three different forms: intravenous, sublingual spray, and the nitroglycerin patch. In medicine, nitroglycerin is probably most commonly prescribed for angina pectoris, a painful symptom of ischemic heart disease caused by inadequate flow of blood and oxygen to the heart and as a potent antihypertensive agent. Nitroglycerin corrects the imbalance between the flow of oxygen and blood to the heart and the heart's energy demand.[35] There are many formulations on the market at different doses. At low doses, nitroglycerin dilates veins more than arteries, thereby reducing preload (volume of blood in the heart after filling); this is thought to be its primary mechanism of action. By decreasing preload, the heart has less blood to pump, which decreases oxygen requirement since the heart does not have to work as hard. Additionally, having a smaller preload reduces the ventricular transmural pressure (pressure exerted on the walls of the heart), which decreases the compression of heart arteries to allow more blood to flow through the heart. At higher doses, it also dilates arteries, thereby reducing afterload (decreasing the pressure against which the heart must pump).[35] An improved ratio of myocardial oxygen demand to supply leads to the following therapeutic effects during episodes of angina pectoris: subsiding of chest pain, decrease of blood pressure, increase of heart rate, and orthostatic hypotension. Patients experiencing angina when doing certain physical activities can often prevent symptoms by taking nitroglycerin 5 to 10 minutes before the activity. Overdoses may generate methemoglobinemia.[36][37]

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
Question: A 69-year-old man is brought by his son to the emergency department with weakness in his right arm and leg. The man insists that he is fine and blames his son for "creating panic". Four hours ago the patient was having tea with his wife when he suddenly dropped his teacup. He has had difficulty moving his right arm since then and cannot walk because his right leg feels stuck. He has a history of hypertension and dyslipidemia, for which he currently takes lisinopril and atorvastatin, respectively. He is allergic to aspirin and peanuts. A computerized tomography (CT) scan shows evidence of an ischemic stroke. Which medication would most likely prevent such attacks in this patient in the future?
Options:
A. Alteplase
B. Urokinase
C. Celecoxib
D. Clopidogrel
