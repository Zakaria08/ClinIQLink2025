        "content": "Ovarian tumors in prepubertal girls represent uncommon but diagnostically challenging entities due to their varied presentation and potential hormonal activity. Sex cord-stromal tumors, comprising approximately 15-20% of pediatric ovarian neoplasms, frequently demonstrate endocrine manifestations due to hormone production. Within this category, granulosa cell tumors (GCTs) represent the predominant subtype with unique clinical and pathological features. Juvenile granulosa cell tumors typically present in the first decade of life, with a mean age of 6.5 years, in contrast to the adult variant more commonly seen in perimenopausal women. The hallmark endocrine manifestation involves autonomous estrogen production, causing precocious pseudopuberty with accelerated growth, breast development, and pubic/axillary hair growth corresponding to advanced Tanner staging incongruent with chronological age. Vulvar mucosal changes, vaginal discharge, and occasionally vaginal bleeding may accompany these changes. Radiologically, these tumors typically present as unilateral, predominantly solid or mixed solid-cystic masses, often with hemorrhagic components due to their vascular nature. Ultrasonography represents the initial imaging modality, with larger tumors occasionally visible on abdominal radiographs as calcified masses. Laboratory evaluation reveals elevated estradiol levels corresponding to the clinical manifestations. Tumor markers including inhibin B may assist in diagnosis and subsequent monitoring. Differential diagnostic considerations include idiopathic precocious puberty, characterized by gonadotropin-dependent changes without ovarian masses, and McCune-Albright syndrome, which features caf\u00e9-au-lait macules and polyostotic fibrous dysplasia accompanying precocious puberty. Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors, by contrast, typically produce androgens rather than estrogens, causing virilization rather than feminization, and occur more commonly in adolescents and young adults rather than young children.",

        "title": "Growth promoting effects of IGF-1",
        "content": "The first demonstration that exogenous IGF-1 stimulates growth was the administration of purified hormone to hypophysectomised rats. After the biosynthesis of IGF-1 identical to the native hormone, trials of its use in humans were begun; first in adults and then in children. Our group was the first to introduce long term administration of biosynthetic IGF-1 to children with primary IGF-1 deficiency\u2014primary GH insensitivity or LS. The finding that daily IGF-1 administration raises serum alkaline phosphatase, which is an indicator of osteoblastic activity, and serum procollagen, in addition to IGFBP-3, led to long term treatment. Treatment of patients with LS was also initiated in other parts of the world. The difference between us and the other groups was that we used a once daily dose, whereas the others administered IGF-1 twice daily. Table 1 compares the linear growth response of children with LS treated by four different groups. It can be seen that before treatment the mean growth velocity was 3\u20134.7 cm/year and that this increased after IGF-1 treatment to 8.2\u20139.1 cm/year, followed by a lower velocity of 5.5\u20136.4 cm/year in the next two years. (In GH treatment the highest growth velocity registered is also in the first year of treatment.) Figure 5 illustrates the growth response to IGF-1 in eight children during the first years of treatment. Ranke and colleagues reported that two of their patients had reached the third centile (Tanner), as did the patient of Krzisnik and Battelino; however, most patients did not reach a normal final height. The reasons may be late initiation of treatment, irregular IGF-1 administration, underdosage, etc. Ranke et al conclude that long term treatment of patients with LS promoted growth and, if treatment is started at an early age, there is a considerable potential for achieving height normalisation. Because no patient in our group was treated since early infancy to final height we cannot confirm this opinion. When the growth response to GH treatment in infants with IGHD was compared with that of IGF-1 in infants with LS we found that the infants with IGHD responded faster and better than those with LS. However, the small number of patients and the differences in growth retardation between the two groups makes it difficult to reach a conclusion. Both hormones stimulated linear growth, but GH seemed more effective than IGF-1. One cause may be the greater growth deficit of the infants with LS than those with IGHD, an insufficient dose of IGF-1, or that there is a need for some GH to provide an adequate stem cell population of prechondrocytes to enable full expression of the growth promoting action of IGF-1, as postulated by Green and colleagues and Ohlson et al. All the above findings based on a few clinical studies with small groups of patients and a few experimental studies remain at present controversial. The crucial question is whether there are any, and if so, whether there are sufficient IGF-1 receptors in the \u201cprogenitor cartilage zone\u201d of the epiphyseal cartilage to respond to endocrine and exogenous IGF-1. Using the mandibular condyle of 2 day old ICR mice, Maor et al showed that these condyles, which resemble the epiphyseal plates of the long bones, contain IGF-1 and high affinity IGF-1 receptors also in the chondroprogenitor cell layers, which enables them to respond to IGF-1 in vitro. Sims et al, using mice with GH receptor KO, showed that IGF-1 administration stimulates the growth (width) of the tibial growth plate and that IGF-1 has a GH independent effect on the growth plate. These findings are similar to those found when treating hypophysectomised rats with IGF-1. In conclusion, IGF-1 is an important growth hormone, mediating the anabolic and linear growth promoting effect of pituitary GH protein. It has a GH independent growth stimulating effect, which with respect to cartilage cells is possibly optimised by the synergistic action with GH.",

        "content": "Electronic health record interventions designed to prompt primary care providers about familial risk factors have demonstrated inconsistent implementation results across healthcare systems. Recent multicenter evaluations revealed that automated family history alerts resulted in minimal change to physician documentation patterns or referral behaviors despite technological investment. The INHERIT trial, examining 124 primary care practices, found no statistically significant difference in risk-appropriate screening rates between intervention and control groups at 18-month follow-up. Provider surveys indicated that 67% of clinicians reported ignoring automated family history prompts due to existing workflow constraints and alert fatigue. Implementation science research continues to identify substantial barriers to effective family history integration, with time limitations and competing clinical priorities consistently emerging as limiting factors. While the theoretical value of family history in risk stratification remains well-established, translating this into actionable clinical behavior change has proven challenging. Current evidence suggests that without substantial workflow redesign and provider education, technological prompting alone produces limited behavioral change in primary care settings. Qualitative analysis has identified that isolated alerting systems without integrated decision support tools and streamlined workflows demonstrate particularly poor adoption and limited clinical impact.",
