Document 1 (Title: Immunological Defects in Recurrent Bacterial Infections): Recurrent, severe, or unusual infections in pediatric patients warrant comprehensive immunological evaluation to identify underlying immune deficiencies. While multiple immune compartments may demonstrate dysfunction, complement deficiencies represent a clinically significant category with distinctive infection susceptibility patterns. The complement system, comprising over 30 soluble and membrane-bound proteins, functions through three activation pathways (classical, alternative, and lectin) converging on a terminal sequence leading to membrane attack complex (MAC) formation. Deficiencies affecting this terminal complement pathway—specifically components C5 through C9—result in a characteristic predisposition to recurrent Neisserial infections, particularly Neisseria meningitidis. Unlike early complement component deficiencies (C1, C2, C4) predominantly associated with autoimmune manifestations, terminal complement deficiencies typically present with recurrent, often severe bacterial infections with relatively normal immune function against other pathogens. The terminal complement sequence initiates with C5 convertase-mediated cleavage of C5 into C5a (an anaphylatoxin) and C5b. C5b subsequently binds sequentially to C6, C7, C8, and multiple C9 molecules, forming the C5b-9 complex (MAC). This transmembrane pore disrupts cellular integrity through osmotic lysis, providing critical defense against Gram-negative bacteria, particularly encapsulated species like Neisseria. The predilection for Neisserial infections reflects the unique importance of MAC-mediated lysis in defense against these organisms, which otherwise resist phagocytosis through their polysaccharide capsules. Patients with terminal complement deficiencies typically experience normal immune responses to most pathogens, maintaining intact phagocytic function, cell-mediated immunity, and antibody production. Clinical manifestations include recurrent meningococcal meningitis, meningococcemia, and other Neisserial infections such as recurrent gonococcal infections, often with atypical serotypes. Diagnostic evaluation includes CH50 assay measuring the classical pathway's functional activity, specific component assays, and potentially genetic testing. Management centers on prophylactic measures including vaccination against Neisseria meningitidis (including non-standard serotypes), antibiotic prophylaxis consideration, and patient education regarding infection recognition and prompt medical attention for febrile illnesses.
Document 2 (Title: Diagnostic Approach to Preeclampsia): Hypertensive disorders complicate 5-10% of pregnancies and contribute significantly to maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality worldwide. Preeclampsia, a pregnancy-specific multisystem disorder characterized by hypertension and end-organ dysfunction after 20 weeks gestation, affects approximately 3-5% of pregnancies. Early detection through regular prenatal assessments remains crucial for optimizing maternal and fetal outcomes. The contemporary diagnostic criteria for preeclampsia focus on both blood pressure parameters and evidence of maternal organ dysfunction. Hypertension, defined as systolic blood pressure ≥140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mmHg on two occasions at least four hours apart, represents the fundamental requirement. Proteinuria, historically considered mandatory for diagnosis, is now recognized as just one of several possible indicators of end-organ involvement. Quantification of urinary protein excretion through 24-hour urine collection remains the gold standard assessment, with significant proteinuria defined as ≥300 mg in 24 hours or a protein/creatinine ratio ≥0.3 mg/dL in a random sample. Other laboratory evaluations, including liver function tests and coagulation studies, help assess hepatic involvement and potential HELLP syndrome (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets). Leukocytosis may occur but lacks specificity for preeclampsia. Clinical manifestations often include rapid weight gain and generalized edema, particularly facial and periorbital, distinguishing it from dependent edema commonly observed in normal pregnancy. Progressive symptoms including headache, visual disturbances, and epigastric pain suggest impending eclampsia, necessitating urgent intervention.
Document 3 (Title: Ethylene glycol poisoning): Signs and symptoms Signs of ethylene glycol poisoning depend upon the time after ingestion. Symptoms usually follow a three step progression, although poisoned individuals will not always develop each stage. Stage 1 (30 minutes to 12 hours) consists of neurological and gastrointestinal symptoms and looks similar to alcohol poisoning. Poisoned individuals may appear to be intoxicated, dizzy, lacking coordination of muscle movements, drooling, depressed, and have slurred speech, seizures, abnormal eye movements, headaches, and confusion. Irritation to the stomach may cause nausea and vomiting. Also seen are excessive thirst and urination. Over time, the body metabolizes ethylene glycol into other toxins. Stage 2 (12 to 36 hours) where signs of “alcohol” poisoning appear to resolve, underlying severe internal damage is still occurring. An elevated heart rate, hyperventilation or increased breathing effort, and dehydration may start to develop, along with high blood pressure and metabolic acidosis. These symptoms are a result of accumulation of organic acids formed by the metabolism of ethylene glycol. Additionally low calcium concentrations in the blood, overactive muscle reflexes, muscle spasms, QT interval prolongation, and congestive heart failure may occur. If untreated, death most commonly occurs during this period. Stage 3 (24 to 72 hours) kidney failure is the result of ethylene glycol poisoning. In cats, this stage occurs 12–24 hours after consuming antifreeze; in dogs, at 36–72 hours after consuming antifreeze. During this stage, severe kidney failure is developing secondary to calcium oxalate crystals forming in the kidneys. Severe lethargy, coma, depression, vomiting, seizures, drooling, and inappetence may be seen. Other symptoms include acute tubular necrosis, red blood cells in the urine, excess proteins in the urine, lower back pain, decreased or absent production of urine, elevated blood concentration of potassium, and acute kidney failure. If kidney failure occurs it is typically reversible, although weeks or months of supportive care including hemodialysis may be required before kidney function returns.

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
Question: A 4-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department by his parents. He is lethargic and confused and has a severe headache, vomiting, and a high-grade fever since earlier that day. His mother reports that the child was doing well until 2 days ago when he developed a fever and green nasal discharge. The patient has a history of neonatal sepsis, meningococcemia at 18 months of age, and pneumococcal pneumonia at 2 and 3 years of age. His scheduled vaccinations are up to date. His blood pressure is 70/50 mm Hg, heart rate is 120/min, respiratory rate is 22/min, and temperature is 39.3°C (102.4°F). On examination, the child is lethargic and his skin is pale, with several petechiae over his buttocks. There is a purulent nasal discharge from both nostrils. The lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Heart sounds are normal. There is marked neck rigidity. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows the following results: Opening pressure 100 mm H2O Appearance cloudy Protein 500 mg/dL (5 g/L) White blood cells 2500/μL (polymorphonuclear predominance) Protein 450 mg/dL (4.5 g/L) Glucose 31 mg/dL (1.7 mmol/L) Culture positive for N. meningitidis Which of the following immunological processes is most likely to be impaired in this child?
Options:
A. Production of IL-2 by Th1 cells
B. Activation of TCRs by MHC-II
C. Formation of C5-9 complex
D. Cleavage of C2 component of complement into C2a and C2b
