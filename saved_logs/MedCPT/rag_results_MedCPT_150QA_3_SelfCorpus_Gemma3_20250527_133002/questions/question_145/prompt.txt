Document 1 (Title: Chelation Therapy in Heavy Metal Toxicity): British Anti-Lewisite (BAL; 2,3-dimercaptopropanol) represents a historically significant chelating agent with continued relevance in specific heavy metal poisoning scenarios requiring rapid intervention. Toxicological applications primarily involve arsenic compounds, with BAL demonstrating high-affinity binding through its vicinal thiol groups forming stable coordination complexes with trivalent arsenic species. This interaction effectively prevents and reverses arsenic binding to critical sulfhydryl-containing enzymes including pyruvate dehydrogenase and lipoic acid, thereby mitigating the primary mechanisms of arsenic toxicity. Clinical implementation demonstrates particular efficacy in acute inorganic arsenic poisoning, with improved survival rates and reduced neurological sequelae when administered within early toxicity phases. Similar binding mechanisms apply to mercury toxicity management, with BAL forming stable mercury-sulfur complexes allowing enhanced elimination through biliary and renal pathways. The chelator demonstrates particular utility for inorganic mercury compounds and elemental mercury exposures, though with more variable efficacy for organomercurial species including methylmercury. Amphoteric metals including zinc and copper demonstrate minimal affinity for BAL's thiol groups, with chelation therapy generally not indicated for toxicity involving these metals. Similarly, aluminum toxicity management typically employs alternative chelating agents including deferoxamine rather than BAL due to formation constant limitations. Clinical administration considerations include parenteral delivery requirements due to BAL's poor oral bioavailability, significant dose-dependent side effects, and potential redistribution of certain metals into the central nervous system necessitating careful risk-benefit assessment and monitoring during implementation. Contemporary toxicological management increasingly incorporates newer, less toxic chelating agents while reserving BAL for specific scenarios requiring its unique binding properties despite its adverse effect profile.
Document 2 (Title: Ethylene glycol poisoning): Signs and symptoms Signs of ethylene glycol poisoning depend upon the time after ingestion. Symptoms usually follow a three step progression, although poisoned individuals will not always develop each stage. Stage 1 (30 minutes to 12 hours) consists of neurological and gastrointestinal symptoms and looks similar to alcohol poisoning. Poisoned individuals may appear to be intoxicated, dizzy, lacking coordination of muscle movements, drooling, depressed, and have slurred speech, seizures, abnormal eye movements, headaches, and confusion. Irritation to the stomach may cause nausea and vomiting. Also seen are excessive thirst and urination. Over time, the body metabolizes ethylene glycol into other toxins. Stage 2 (12 to 36 hours) where signs of “alcohol” poisoning appear to resolve, underlying severe internal damage is still occurring. An elevated heart rate, hyperventilation or increased breathing effort, and dehydration may start to develop, along with high blood pressure and metabolic acidosis. These symptoms are a result of accumulation of organic acids formed by the metabolism of ethylene glycol. Additionally low calcium concentrations in the blood, overactive muscle reflexes, muscle spasms, QT interval prolongation, and congestive heart failure may occur. If untreated, death most commonly occurs during this period. Stage 3 (24 to 72 hours) kidney failure is the result of ethylene glycol poisoning. In cats, this stage occurs 12–24 hours after consuming antifreeze; in dogs, at 36–72 hours after consuming antifreeze. During this stage, severe kidney failure is developing secondary to calcium oxalate crystals forming in the kidneys. Severe lethargy, coma, depression, vomiting, seizures, drooling, and inappetence may be seen. Other symptoms include acute tubular necrosis, red blood cells in the urine, excess proteins in the urine, lower back pain, decreased or absent production of urine, elevated blood concentration of potassium, and acute kidney failure. If kidney failure occurs it is typically reversible, although weeks or months of supportive care including hemodialysis may be required before kidney function returns.
Document 3 (Title: Clinical Manifestations of Ethylene Glycol Exposure): Ethylene glycol intoxication presents a distinctive multi-system toxidrome requiring prompt recognition and intervention due to its potentially lethal consequences. Following ingestion, the parent compound undergoes hepatic metabolism generating multiple toxic metabolites with widespread organ impacts. Kidney injury represents a hallmark manifestation, with calcium oxalate crystalluria progressing to acute tubular necrosis and potential renal failure within 24-72 hours post-ingestion. Characteristic neurological involvement occurs in a biphasic pattern, with initial CNS depression followed by delayed cerebral edema, seizures, and potentially irreversible neurological damage mediated through metabolite neurotoxicity. Profound metabolic derangements typically develop as the intoxication progresses, including a severe high-anion-gap metabolic acidosis resulting from glycolic and oxalic acid accumulation. Concurrent electrolyte abnormalities frequently complicate management, particularly hypocalcemia secondary to calcium oxalate formation. Cardiopulmonary manifestations emerge in moderate to severe poisonings, including myocardial depression, conduction disturbances, and in severe cases, circulatory collapse requiring vasopressor support. Multiple case series document QT prolongation and tachyarrhythmias in significant exposures, sometimes necessitating advanced cardiac life support interventions. Comprehensive toxicology references describe additional rare manifestations in severe cases, though notably excluding ototoxicity or permanent hearing alterations, which remain absent from major case registries despite extensive documentation of other system effects. These collective manifestations create a recognizable pattern distinguishing ethylene glycol poisoning from other toxic alcohol ingestions, guiding appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic interventions including fomepizole administration, potential hemodialysis, and supportive care.
