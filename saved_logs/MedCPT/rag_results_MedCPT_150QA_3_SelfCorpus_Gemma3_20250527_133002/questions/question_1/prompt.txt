Document 1 (Title: Diagnostic Approach to Preeclampsia): Hypertensive disorders complicate 5-10% of pregnancies and contribute significantly to maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality worldwide. Preeclampsia, a pregnancy-specific multisystem disorder characterized by hypertension and end-organ dysfunction after 20 weeks gestation, affects approximately 3-5% of pregnancies. Early detection through regular prenatal assessments remains crucial for optimizing maternal and fetal outcomes. The contemporary diagnostic criteria for preeclampsia focus on both blood pressure parameters and evidence of maternal organ dysfunction. Hypertension, defined as systolic blood pressure ≥140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mmHg on two occasions at least four hours apart, represents the fundamental requirement. Proteinuria, historically considered mandatory for diagnosis, is now recognized as just one of several possible indicators of end-organ involvement. Quantification of urinary protein excretion through 24-hour urine collection remains the gold standard assessment, with significant proteinuria defined as ≥300 mg in 24 hours or a protein/creatinine ratio ≥0.3 mg/dL in a random sample. Other laboratory evaluations, including liver function tests and coagulation studies, help assess hepatic involvement and potential HELLP syndrome (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets). Leukocytosis may occur but lacks specificity for preeclampsia. Clinical manifestations often include rapid weight gain and generalized edema, particularly facial and periorbital, distinguishing it from dependent edema commonly observed in normal pregnancy. Progressive symptoms including headache, visual disturbances, and epigastric pain suggest impending eclampsia, necessitating urgent intervention.
Document 2 (Title: Antibiotic Selection for Urinary Tract Infections During Pregnancy): Management of urinary tract infections during pregnancy requires careful antibiotic selection due to potential impacts on both maternal and fetal health. First-line agents should demonstrate efficacy against common uropathogens while minimizing fetal risk. Beta-lactams such as ampicillin have historically been used but rising resistance among Escherichia coli limits their empiric utility. Third-generation cephalosporins like ceftriaxone, while effective, are typically reserved for pyelonephritis or complicated infections requiring parenteral therapy. Tetracyclines, including doxycycline, are contraindicated during pregnancy due to risks of dental discoloration and potential inhibition of bone growth in the developing fetus. Nitrofurantoin represents an optimal choice for uncomplicated cystitis in pregnancy after the first trimester and before 36 weeks gestation, offering several advantages: it achieves high urinary tract concentrations with minimal systemic absorption, demonstrates efficacy against most urinary pathogens including E. coli, and has minimal impact on maternal and fetal intestinal flora. Clinical trials have consistently demonstrated its safety profile during the second and most of the third trimester, with no significant increase in congenital malformations. Nitrofurantoin should be avoided near term (>36 weeks) due to theoretical risk of hemolytic anemia in G6PD-deficient neonates.
Document 3 (Title: Nitroglycerin): Abstract: 1 Blood pressure, systemic arterial compliance, and diameter, blood flow velocity, volumic flow and impedance of the brachial artery were measured before and after intravenous administration of nitroglycerin (15 micrograms/min during 15 min) in 11 patients with sustained essential hypertension. 2 For the evaluation of the diameter of the brachial artery, a bidimensional pulsed Doppler was used, enabling the angle of the ultrasound beam relative to the flowing stream of blood to be measured with an error of less than 2%. 3 After nitroglycerin, systolic pressure significantly decreased (P less than 0.01) without significant change in diastolic and mean arterial pressures, cardiac index, stroke index and total peripheral resistance. 4 Systemic arterial compliance and brachial artery diameter significantly increased (P less than 0.001; P less than 0.01) while velocity and blood flow of the brachial artery were unchanged. 5 The pattern of the input impedance of the brachial artery was consistent with a predominant effect of nitroglycerin on the viscoelastic properties of peripheral large arteries. 6 The study provided evidence that, in hypertensive patients, nitroglycerin has a direct effect on peripheral large arteries, causing an increase in arterial diameter and compliance, thus leading to a predominant decrease in systolic pressure.

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
Question: A 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presents with burning upon urination. She states it started 1 day ago and has been worsening despite drinking more water and taking cranberry extract. She otherwise feels well and is followed by a doctor for her pregnancy. Her temperature is 97.7°F (36.5°C), blood pressure is 122/77 mmHg, pulse is 80/min, respirations are 19/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is notable for an absence of costovertebral angle tenderness and a gravid uterus. Which of the following is the best treatment for this patient?
Options:
A. Ampicillin
B. Ceftriaxone
C. Doxycycline
D. Nitrofurantoin
