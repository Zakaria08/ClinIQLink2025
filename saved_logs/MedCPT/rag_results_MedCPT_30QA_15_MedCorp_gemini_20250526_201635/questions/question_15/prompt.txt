Document 1 (Title: Intima-media thickness): Carotid IMT has been used in many epidemiological and clinical studies and these have shown associations with several risk factors, including type 2 diabetes, familial hypercholesterolemia, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), triglycerides, rheumatoid arthritis, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and air pollution. Since the 1990s, some clinical trials of lifestyle and pharmaceutical interventions have also used carotid artery IMT as a surrogate endpoint for evaluating the regression and/or progression of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; however the appropriateness of carotid IMT in this context is uncertain. Although carotid intima-media thickness is strongly associated with atherosclerosis, thickening of the intima-media may not always be due to atherosclerosis. Intima-medial thickening is a complex process, depending on a variety of factors, including blood pressure, local hemodynamics, shear stress and circumferential tensile stress. Variations in IMT between
Document 2 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Missense and nonsense mutations in the apoA-I gene are present in some patients with low plasma levels of HDL-C (usually 15–30 mg/ dL), but are a rare cause of low plasma HDL-C levels. Most individuals with low plasma HDL-C levels due to missense mutations in apoA-I do not appear to have premature CHD. Patients who are heterozygous for an Arg173Cys substitution in apoA-I (so-called apoA-IMilano) have very low plasma levels of HDL-C due to impaired LCAT activation and accelerated clearance of the HDL particles containing the abnormal apoA-I. Despite having very low plasma levels of HDL-C, these individuals do not have an increased risk of premature CHD. A few selected missense mutations in apoA-I and apoA-II promote the formation of amyloid fibrils, which can cause systemic amyloidosis.
Document 3 (Title: IDL, VLDL, chylomicrons and atherosclerosis.): In humans with the lipoprotein lipase deficiency disorder large amounts of chylomicrons and large very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) accumulate in plasma. In spite of this, atherosclerosis does not seem to develop at an accelerated rate, suggesting that these lipoproteins do not promote atherogenesis. In humans with dysbetalipoproteinemia remnant lipoproteins (intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL) plus beta-VLDL) accumulate in plasma and these particles may therefore be the factor causing accelerated atherosclerosis in this disorder. Epidemiological studies in humans suggest that IDL or remnant lipoproteins are predictors of the severity or progression of atherosclerosis. Similar studies in the St. Thomas' Hospital rabbit strain, an animal model with genetically elevated plasma levels of VLDL, IDL and low-density lipoprotein (LDL), showed that IDL or remnant lipoproteins were better predictors of the extent of atherosclerosis than were LDL or VLDL. Studies of lipoprotein/arterial wall interactions have demonstrated that the larger the lipoprotein particle, the lower the influx into intima. Very large VLDL and chylomicrons do not seem to enter intima. Although high-density lipoprotein (HDL) enters intima faster than other lipoproteins, the small HDL particles seem to penetrate the entire arterial wall and leave via lymphatics and vasa vasorum in the outer media and adventitia. In contrast, LDL, and possibly also IDL and smaller VLDL, may only leave the intima via the lumen of the artery. In conclusion, a substantial body of evidence suggests that remnant lipoproteins (IDL and smaller VLDL) share with LDL the potential for promoting atherosclerosis, whereas very large VLDL and chylomicrons do not seem to have this effect.
Document 4 (Title: Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia -- Complications): Patients with CAH are at an increased risk of cardiometabolic diseases, including hypertension, obesity, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, impaired glucose homeostasis, increased carotid intima-media thickness, and cardiovascular events. However, most data available are based on surrogate markers rather than definitive outcomes. [51] [52] Practitioners should remain cautious, promote a healthy lifestyle, and continue analyzing longer-term data to assess hard outcomes.
Document 5 (Title: Hepatic lipase): Secretion of HDL from the liver into the circulatory system regulates the release of HL into the body's bloodstream. This is because factors that increase the release of HDL (such as fasting, leading to low levels of HDL) increases the amount of HL bound to HDL and released into the bloodstream. Another lipoprotein, ApoA-I, which increases release of HDL was shown to have a similar effect by mutating the gene that coded it. Mutated ApoA-I protein caused a decrease in HL release and thus decreased the amount of HL bound to HDL and released into the bloodstream. Clinical significance Hepatic lipase deficiency is a rare, autosomal recessive disorder that results in elevated high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol due to a mutation in the hepatic lipase gene. Clinical features are not well understood and there are no characteristic xanthomas. There is an association with a delay in atherosclerosis in an animal model.
Document 6 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): INHERITED CAUSES OF VERY HIGH LEVELS OF HDL-C CETP Deficiency Loss-of-function mutations in both alleles of the gene encoding CETP cause substantially elevated HDL-C levels (usually >150 mg/dL). As noted above, CETP transfers cholesteryl esters from HDL to apoB-containing lipoproteins (Fig. 421-3). Absence of this transfer activity results in an increase in the cholesteryl ester content of HDL and a reduction in plasma levels of LDL-C. The large, cholesterol-rich HDL particles circulating in these patients are cleared at a reduced rate. CETP deficiency was first diagnosed in Japanese persons and is rare outside of Japan. The relationship of CETP deficiency to ASCVD remains unresolved. Heterozygotes for CETP deficiency have only modestly elevated HDL-C levels. Based on the phenotype of high HDL-C in CETP deficiency, pharmacologic inhibition of CETP is under development as a new therapeutic approach to both raise HDL-C levels and lower LDL-C levels, but whether it will reduce risk of
Document 7 (Title: Low HDL Cholesterol -- Complications): Elevation of HDL cholesterol without a substantial increase in HDL particle can result in cholesterol overloaded HDL particles, which in one community-based cohort study showed an increased progression towards carotid atherosclerosis as measured by carotid intimal medial thickening in asymptomatic patients with no underlying atherosclerotic disease. CETP inhibitors and niacin both raise HDLC levels without having any effect on HDL function or number of particles and therefore tend to increase cholesterol overloaded particles. [43]
Document 8 (Title: Familial Combined Hyperlipidemia -- Evaluation): Several studies have reported an association between FCH and increased carotid intima-media thickness (IMT), a marker of subclinical atherosclerosis. Therefore, a carotid ultrasound may be performed to assess the presence of subclinical atherosclerosis in patients with FCH. [24] [25]
Document 9 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Mutations in genes encoding proteins that play critical roles in HDL synthesis and catabolism can result in reductions in plasma levels of HDL-C. Unlike the genetic forms of hypercholesterolemia, which are invariably associated with premature coronary atherosclerosis, genetic forms of hypoalphalipoproteinemia (low HDL-C) are often not associated with clearly increased risk of ASCVD.
Document 10 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Disorders of Lipoprotein Metabolism 2446 disease. This syndrome is often referred to as isolated low HDL. A family history of low HDL-C facilitates the diagnosis of an inherited condition, which may follow an autosomal dominant pattern. The metabolic etiology of this disease appears to be primarily accelerated catabolism of HDL and its apolipoproteins. Some of these patients may have ABCA1 mutations and therefore technically have heterozygous Tangier disease. Several kindreds with primary hypoalphalipoproteinemia and an increased incidence of premature CHD have been described, although it is not clear if the low HDL-C level is the cause of the accelerated atherosclerosis in these families. Association of hypoalphalipoproteinemia with premature CHD may depend on the specific nature of the gene defect or the underlying metabolic defect that either directly or indirectly causes the low plasma HDL-C level.
Document 11 (Title: Familial Combined Hyperlipidemia -- Complications -- Atherosclerosis): Familial combined hyperlipidemia is linked to a higher likelihood of developing atherosclerosis. While some patients may not experience any symptoms, evaluating the intima-media thickness of the common carotid artery can serve as a means of estimating the risk. [37]
Document 12 (Title: Interactions of serum copper, selenium, and low density lipoprotein cholesterol in atherogenesis.): To investigate the interactions between serum copper, selenium, and low density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations with regard to the progression of carotid atherosclerosis. Longitudinal study of a cohort of middle aged men followed up for 24 months. Epidemiological survey of the population of seven communities in eastern Finland. 126 men aged 42, 48, 54, or 60 at examination randomly selected from a population based sample of 2682 men. Increase in maximal carotid intima media thickness. The mean increase in the maximal common carotid intima media thickness after two years was greater in men with high serum copper concentrations (0.16 mm compared with 0.08 mm in men with concentrations less than 17.6 mumol/l; p = 0.010), those with low serum selenium concentrations (0.15 mm compared with 0.09 mm in men with concentrations greater than or equal to 1.40 mumol/l; p = 0.035), and those with raised serum low density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations (0.15 mm compared with 0.08 mm in men with concentrations less than 4.0 mmol/l; p = 0.032) after adjustment for age and cigarette pack years in a three way analysis of covariance. A raised serum low density lipoprotein concentration was associated with accelerated progression of atherosclerosis only in men with higher than median serum copper concentrations (net difference 0.22 mm; p less than 0.001 for two way interaction), and this synergism was even more pronounced in men with serum selenium concentrations below the median value (net difference 0.41 mm; p = 0.042 for three way interaction). These data provide evidence of a synergistic effect of copper (a pro-oxidant), a low serum concentration of selenium (a cofactor of an enzyme that scavenges free radicals), and low density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration in atherogenesis.
Document 13 (Title: Arterial wall thickness in familial hypercholesterolemia. Ultrasound measurement of intima-media thickness in the common carotid artery.): B-mode ultrasound was used to noninvasively determine wall thickness and lumen diameter in the common carotid artery in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (n = 53) and in a control group (n = 53). The controls were matched for sex, age, height, and weight, and all had a serum cholesterol level below 6.5 mmol/l. The study was performed to evaluate whether the patients had a thicker arterial wall compared with that of the control group. Wall thickness was determined as the combined intima-media thickness of the far wall and is presented as the mean and maximum thickness of a 10-mm-long section of the common carotid artery. The difference between the groups was 0.13 mm in mean wall thickness (p less than 0.001; 95% confidence interval, 0.07-0.18 mm) and 0.20 mm in maximum wall thickness (p less than 0.001; 95% confidence interval, 0.09-0.23 mm). Fifty of the subjects were examined twice to estimate the interobserver variability. The coefficients of variation for mean and maximum wall thickness were 10.2% and 8.9%, respectively. The two study groups were well matched and differed only in lipid levels. Thus, there is reason to believe that the difference in wall thickness can be explained by the background of familial hypercholesterolemia and the increased cholesterol levels.
Document 14 (Title: Determinants of carotid intima-media thickness: a population-based ultrasonography study in eastern Finnish men.): We investigated the determinants of maximal intima-media thickness of common carotid arteries in a population-based sample of 1224 Eastern Finnish men aged 42, 48, 54 or 60 years. A high-resolution B-mode ultrasonographic examination was performed as part of the Kuopio Ischaemic Heart Disease Risk Factor Study (KIHD). The maximal intima-media thickness (IMT) varied between 0.48 mm and 4.09 mm (mean value +/- SD, 0.94 mm +/- 0.38 mm). Age (standardized partial coefficient, beta = 0.238, P less than 0.0001), ambulatory pulse pressure (beta = 0.130, P less than 0.0001), cigarette-years of smoking (beta = 0.125, P less than 0.0001), serum LDL cholesterol concentration (beta = 0.125, P less than 0.0001), history of ischaemic heart disease (beta = 0.125, P less than 0.0001), pre-exercise systolic blood pressure (beta = 0.070, P = 0.0113) and diabetes (beta = 0.068, P = 0.0072) were most strongly associated with IMT. This study confirms the role of systolic blood pressure, smoking and serum LDL cholesterol levels as major risk factors for increased carotid intima-media thickness.
Document 15 (Title: Detection of premature atherosclerosis by high-resolution ultrasonography in symptom-free hypopituitary adults.): Retrospective analysis suggests that there is increased mortality from vascular disease in hypopituitary adults, but vascular status before death is unknown. High resolution B-mode ultrasonic imaging of both carotid and femoral arteries was therefore done in 34 adult hypopituitary patients on routine replacement therapy and was compared with that in 39 matched controls. Changes were related to risk factors for vascular disease. Carotid intima-media thickness was greater in patients than in controls (mean [SD] 0.74 [0.16] vs 0.65 [0.13] mm, p &lt; 0.02). This difference was seen in middle-aged and elderly patients. More patients than controls had one or more atheromatous plaques (65% vs 41%, p &lt; 0.05). The percentage of individual arteries with a plaque was also higher in patients (32% vs 18%, p &lt; 0.005). In multiple regression analysis, patients' age was the dominant factor determining carotid intima-media thickness. Symptom-free adults with hypopituitarism show an increased prevalence of atherosclerosis.
