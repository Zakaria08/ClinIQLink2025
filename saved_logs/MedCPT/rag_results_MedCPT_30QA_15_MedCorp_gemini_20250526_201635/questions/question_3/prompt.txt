Document 1 (Title: Obesity): The most effective treatment for obesity is bariatric surgery. The types of procedures include laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, vertical-sleeve gastrectomy, and biliopancreatic diversion. Surgery for severe obesity is associated with long-term weight loss, improvement in obesity-related conditions, and decreased overall mortality, however, improved metabolic health results from the weight loss, not the surgery. One study found a weight loss of between 14% and 25% (depending on the type of procedure performed) at 10 years, and a 29% reduction in all cause mortality when compared to standard weight loss measures. Complications occur in about 17% of cases and reoperation is needed in 7% of cases. Epidemiology
Document 2 (Title: Duodenal switch: a new form of pancreaticobiliary diversion.): The duodenal switch operation is a new form of pancreaticobiliary diversion with superior physiologic consequences compared with the Roux-en-Y procedure. The new technique has been extensively tested in the laboratory and found to be nonulcerogenic and to be less disruptive of foregut physiology than the Roux-en-Y procedure. The duodenal switch has been used in more than 40 patients with confirmed duodenogastric reflux and has proved to be well tolerated and successful in long-term follow-up.

Document 5 (Title: Bariatric surgery): Bariatric surgery (or weight loss surgery) includes a variety of procedures performed on people who are obese. Long term weight loss through the standard of care procedures (Roux en-Y bypass, sleeve gastrectomy, and biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch) is largely achieved by altering gut hormone levels responsible for hunger and satiety, leading to a new hormonal weight set point. Bariatric surgery is a hormonal surgery in these procedures, for which the alteration in gut hormones develops as a result of the procedure's restriction and malabsorption.
Document 6 (Title: Surgical Options in the Treatment of Severe Obesity -- Issues of Concern -- Bariatric Procedures for Management of Severe Obesity): The weight loss mechanism typically falls into 1 of 2 categories, but some procedures have both components. These mechanisms include malabsorption and restriction. Neurohormonal effects contribute to the regulation of energy balance and hunger control. Key hormones include leptin and ghrelin. Examples of restrictive procedures include vertical banded gastroplasty, laparoscopic adjustable gastric band, and sleeve gastrectomy. Malabsorptive procedures include jejunoileal bypass, biliopancreatic diversion (BPD), or biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch. A combination procedure commonly performed is the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. [6]
Document 7 (Title: Gastrointestinal malabsorptive procedures.): Morbid obesity is a complex disease, the etiology of which is clearly multifactorial. The weight loss produced by intestinal shunting procedures has been profound and the etiology of the weight loss is clearly more complex than rapid intestinal transit and gross malabsorption of foodstuffs. The best known surgically produced malabsorptive procedure for the treatment of morbid obesity is the jejunoileal bypass. This procedure produces substantial weight loss but has been associated with late postoperative complications that make its use problematical. Other procedures (biliary bypass, biliopancreatic diversion, and long limb Roux-en-Y gastric bypass) have not been associated with liver dysfunction. Varying degrees of malnutrition are frequently associated with these procedures. Careful study of the patients with these procedures is warranted.
Document 8 (Title: Gastric surgery for morbid obesity. Complications and long-term weight control.): The efficacy of gastric surgery for morbid obesity has often been questioned because of incomplete long-term patient follow-up. Between 1977 and 1984, 537 consecutive patients received either a gastric bypass with a Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy, an unbanded gastrogastrostomy, or a vertical banded gastroplasty. The follow-up period was 5 years for all patients who underwent Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy and unbanded gastrogastrostomy and 3 years for all patients who underwent vertical banded gastroplasty. Only 5.8% of all patients were unavailable for this late follow-up. The unbanded gastrogastrostomy was not an effective weight-control operation. Both the Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy and vertical banded gastroplasty provided effective long-term weight control. Although the Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy gave slightly better weight control than the vertical banded gastroplasty, the more simple, safe, and physiological vertical banded gastroplasty is the procedure of choice for most patients with morbid obesity.
Document 9 (Title: Anesthetic Considerations In Bariatric Surgery -- Issues of Concern -- Types of Bariatric Surgery): The Roux-en-Y gastric bypass creates a small gastric pouch and anastomosis to a Roux limb of the jejunum that bypasses 75 to 150 cm of the small bowel, thereby restricting food volume at any given time and limiting absorption. Alternatively, a biliopancreatic diversion with a duodenal switch is associated with a more malabsorptive technique. The duodenal switch carries a greater risk for surgical complications but may be recommended for patients with severe obesity and diabetes. The duodenal switch reduces the size of the stomach by approximately 60% to 70% (versus 70% to 80% with a Roux-en-Y.) [16]
Document 10 (Title: Conversion surgery for morbid obesity: complications and long-term weight control.): Some operations for morbid obesity fail--for a variety of reasons. To better understand the risk and efficacy of converting, during a single operation, a failed procedure to a second type of operation for morbid obesity, a review was made of all 120 patients who underwent this type of conversion surgery at one university hospital during a 10-year period. The initial operations of 62 patients were converted to a gastric bypass with a Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy, 11 to an unbanded gastrogastrostomy, and 47 to a vertical banded gastroplasty. Four patients are dead (three of unrelated causes), 11 have undergone a third operation for morbid obesity, and five (4.2%) are lost to follow-up. For 69 of 86 patients, 3- to 5-year follow-up data are available. Serious early complications occurred in 5.8% of the patients. Almost 80% of the patients who received an unbanded gastrogastroplasty did not control their weight, whereas most of those who received a Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy or a vertical banded gastroplasty had satisfactory long-term weight control 3 to 5 years later, maintaining an average weight loss of 30% of their original weight or 55% of their excess weight. Conversion surgery is safe and effective.
Document 11 (Title: Adjustable gastric band): Unlike more open forms of weight loss surgery (e.g. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery (RNY), Biliopancreatic diversion (BPD) and Duodenal Switch (DS)), gastric banding does not require cutting or removing any part of the digestive system. It is removable, requiring only a laparoscopic procedure to remove the band, after which the stomach usually returns to its normal pre-banded size so it is not unusual for a person to gain weight after having a band removed. However, it is not entirely reversible as adhesions and tissue scarring are inevitable. Unlike those who have procedures such as RNY, DS, or BPD, it is unusual for gastric band patients to experience any nutritional deficiencies or malabsorption of micro-nutrients. Calcium supplements and Vitamin B12 injections are not routinely required following gastric banding (as is often the case with RNY, for example). Gastric dumping syndrome issues also do not occur since intestines are not removed or re-routed.
Document 12 (Title: Postoperative Assessment and Management of Obesity Surgery -- Technique or Treatment -- Surgical Obesity Treatment): There are different types of surgical obesity treatment: malabsorptive and restrictive procedures and a combination of both. Malabsorptive surgeries prevent the absorption of food and restrict work by reducing the volume of food intake due to early satiety. [3] The 4 most commonly performed bariatric surgeries include the adjustable gastric band (AGB), sleeve gastrectomy (SG), Roux-en-y gastric bypass (RYGB), and the biliopancreatic diversion (BPD), also known as the duodenal switch (DS).
Document 13 (Title: Surgical Options in the Treatment of Severe Obesity -- Other Issues -- Primarily Revisional Procedures): Band revisions are utilized in patients who fail the band or have health complications requiring removal. Options for a failed band procedure can include conversion to a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy, or biliopancreatic diversion with a duodenal switch. The band can also be replaced. Revisional timing is important due to inflammation or fibrosis of gastric tissue due to the band's presence. A staged approach can be utilized with the band removed, and then, after an 8-to-12-week period, the band can be converted to another bariatric procedure. [13]
Document 14 (Title: Surgical Options in the Treatment of Severe Obesity -- Clinical Significance -- Single-Anastomosis Duodenoileal Bypass with Sleeve Gastrectomy): The procedure of a single anastomosis duodenoileal bypass with sleeve gastrectomy is essentially a variant of the biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch operation. A transected portion of the duodenum is anastomosed to a loop of the distal small intestine, which differs from the Roux-en-Y-like configuration used in the biliopancreatic diversion procedures. Hence, there is only 1 single anastomosis. The reasoning for developing this single anastomosis procedure was to reduce both the complexity and risks of performing a Roux-en-Y with a smaller diameter distal bowel and a necessity for 2 anastomoses. This procedure has been endorsed as an appropriate primary metabolic bariatric surgery by the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery. [10]
