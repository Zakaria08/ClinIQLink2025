Document 1 (Title: Vitamin B6 in clinical neurology.): Many conditions in clinical neurology may be responsive to pyridoxine as a therapeutic agent. The current difficulty is in trying to isolate the conditions that are most likely to respond. Treating seizures is a major part of a neurologic practice. Our current therapeutic agents are only partially successful and limited by multiple side effects. One problem is that patients often have to take these agents for an entire lifetime, further raising the risk of toxicity. If pyridoxine supplementation can improve the efficacy of currently used medications, it will be gladly accepted into our therapeutic arsenal. Headache, chronic pain, and depression all appear to run together in many of our patients. The observations that serotonin deficiency is a common thread between them and that pyridoxine can raise serotonin levels open a wide range of therapeutic options. Small studies have been carried out with mixed success. Comparison with amitriptyline in the treatment of headache appears to show about equal efficacy, although side effects would be expected to be more of a problem with the amitriptyline. Behavioral disorders are relatively common and continue to be a major problem, disrupting the lives of the patients and their families. Current treatments are not acceptable to most people because of the risk of side effects with long-term usage. If, as Dr. Feingold suggests, many of these problems are caused by "toxic" exposures to chemicals that are pyridoxine antagonists, supplementation at early ages may reduce the incidence of hyperactivity and aggressive behavior. This raises the question of safety. Is pyridoxine safe for long-term use in large segments of the population, including children? The studies on children with Down's syndrome and autism, utilizing much higher doses than are used for other therapeutic purposes, seem to indicate relative safety if carefully monitored. Studies involving large population groups with carpal tunnel syndrome, all adults, using 100-150 mg/day have shown minimal or no toxicity in five- to 10-year studies. Women self-medicating for PMS taking 500 to 5000 mg/day have shown peripheral neuropathy within one to three years. It would appear from this retrospective analysis that pyridoxine is safe at doses of 100 mg/day or less in adults. In children there is not enough data to make any sort of suggestion. Because the major neurologic complication is a peripheral neuropathy and the causes of this condition are myriad, pyridoxine may cause neuropathy only in patients with a pre-existing susceptibility to this condition.
Document 2 (Title: First_Aid_Step2): SSRIs Fluoxetine, sertraline, paroxetine, citalopram, f uvoxamine Depression and anxiety. Sexual side effects, GI distress, agitation, insomnia, tremor, diarrhea. Serotonin syndrome (fever, myoclonus, mental status changes, cardiovascular collapse) can occur if SSRIs are used with MAOIs. Paroxetine can cause pulmonary hypertension in the fetus. Atypicals Bupropion, venlafaxine, mirtazapine, trazodone Depression, anxiety, and chronic pain. Bupropion: ↓ seizure threshold; minimal sexual side effects. Contraindicated in patients with eating disorders as well as in seizure patients. Venlafaxine: Diastolic hypertension. Mirtazapine: Weight gain, sedation. Trazodone: Highly sedating; priapism. Nortriptyline, desipramine, amitriptyline, imipramine Depression, anxiety disorder, chronic pain, migraine headaches, enuresis (imipramine).

Document 3 (Title: Imipramine -- Monitoring): Treatment with imipramine and other tricyclics usually requires a duration of around 4 to 5 weeks to elicit a good response. Research has shown that increasing the dose of imipramine to greater than 300ng/mL effectively treated severe depression. However, when the drug level greatly exceeds 300ng/mL, it will be more likely to be associated with significant and serious side effects. Extreme precautions are necessary, especially in a patient with cardiovascular disease, including conduction defects, tachycardia, acute myocardial infarction, and hepatic impairment. When coadministering imipramine with a MOAI, it can lead to fatal hypertensive crisis or seizures. When imipramine is co-ingested with SSRI, it can cause serotonin syndrome. [7] [5]
Document 4 (Title: Serotonin Syndrome -- Prognosis): The prognosis of serotonin syndrome varies on the degree of serotonin toxicity, which is primarily attributable to the dose and type of serotonergic agent. Notably, MAO-I's are associated with the most severe cases of serotonin syndrome, but intentional overdoses of any serotonergic drug can result in severe presentations. Mild cases may only require observation, while severe cases require intensive care. After serotonin syndrome resolves, a comprehensive assessment is needed to assess the risks and benefits of resuming the previous serotonergic regimen. [9]
Document 5 (Title: Amitriptyline): Amitriptiline counteracts the antihypertensive action of guanethidine. When given with amitriptyline, other anticholinergic agents may result in hyperpyrexia or paralytic ileus. Co-administration of amitriptyline and disulfiram is not recommended due to the potential for the development of toxic delirium. Amitriptyline causes an unusual type of interaction with the anticoagulant phenprocoumon during which great fluctuations of the prothrombin time have been observed. Pharmacology Pharmacodynamics Amitriptyline inhibits serotonin transporter (SERT) and norepinephrine transporter (NET). It is metabolized to nortriptyline, a stronger norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, further augmenting amitriptyline's effects on norepinephrine reuptake (see the Table on the right). Amitriptyline additionally acts as a potent inhibitor of the serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, the α1A-adrenergic, the histamine H1 and the M1-M5 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (see the Table on the right).
Document 6 (Title: Diphenhydramine): Acute poisoning can be fatal, leading to cardiovascular collapse and death in 2–18 hours, and in general is treated using a symptomatic and supportive approach. Diagnosis of toxicity is based on history and clinical presentation, and in general specific levels are not useful. Several levels of evidence strongly indicate diphenhydramine (similar to chlorpheniramine) can block the delayed rectifier potassium channel and, as a consequence, prolong the QT interval, leading to cardiac arrhythmias such as torsades de pointes. No specific antidote for diphenhydramine toxicity is known, but the anticholinergic syndrome has been treated with physostigmine for severe delirium or tachycardia. Benzodiazepines may be administered to decrease the likelihood of psychosis, agitation, and seizures in people who are prone to these symptoms. Interactions Alcohol may increase the drowsiness caused by diphenhydramine. Pharmacology Pharmacodynamics
Document 7 (Title: Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor Toxicity -- Treatment / Management): Nelson et al. [24] established guidelines for out-of-hospital management of isolated SSRI overdose and recommended at-home observation of patients who were experiencing minor symptoms and had ingested less than 5 times their own prescribed dose or less than 5 times the initial adult dose in an SSRI-naive patient. This should only be done in close conjunction with a regional poison control center.

Document 9 (Title: Amitriptyline -- Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes): Patients on amitriptyline can have anticholinergic, antihistaminic, and alpha-adrenergic blocking adverse effects. It may not be appropriate for patients with cardiac problems. Amitriptyline has many potential drug interactions, increasing the risk of arrhythmias and serotonin syndrome. Toxicity can be life-threatening, and patients must be stabilized and monitored closely. Healthcare providers must also know the increased risk of suicidality in children, adolescents, and young adults, requiring discussion with families. [40]
Document 10 (Title: Serotonin syndrome): Spectrum concept A postulated "spectrum concept" of serotonin toxicity emphasises the role that progressively increasing serotonin levels play in mediating the clinical picture as side effects merge into toxicity. The dose-effect relationship is the effects of progressive elevation of serotonin, either by raising the dose of one drug, or combining it with another serotonergic drug which may produce large elevations in serotonin levels. Some experts prefer the terms serotonin toxicity or serotonin toxidrome, to more accurately reflect that it is a form of poisoning. Diagnosis
Document 11 (Title: Tramadol): Dependence and withdrawal Long-term use of high doses of tramadol causes physical dependence and withdrawal syndrome. These include both symptoms typical of opioid withdrawal and those associated with serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) withdrawal; symptoms include numbness, tingling, paresthesia, and tinnitus. Psychiatric symptoms may include hallucinations, paranoia, extreme anxiety, panic attacks, and confusion. In most cases, tramadol withdrawal will set in 12–20 hours after the last dose, but this can vary. Tramadol withdrawal typically lasts longer than that of other opioids. Seven days or more of acute withdrawal symptoms can occur as opposed to typically 3 or 4 days for other codeine analogues. Overdose Recognised risk factors for tramadol overdose include respiratory depression, addiction, and seizures. Naloxone only partially reverses the toxic effects of tramadol overdose and may increase the risk of seizures.
Document 12 (Title: Serotonin): Serotonin syndrome Extremely high levels of serotonin can cause a condition known as serotonin syndrome, with toxic and potentially fatal effects. In practice, such toxic levels are essentially impossible to reach through an overdose of a single antidepressant drug, but require a combination of serotonergic agents, such as an SSRI with a MAOI, which may occur in therapeutic doses. The intensity of the symptoms of serotonin syndrome vary over a wide spectrum, and the milder forms are seen even at nontoxic levels. It is estimated that 14% of patients experiencing serotonin syndrome overdose on SSRIs; meanwhile the fatality rate is between 2% to 12%. Antiemetics Some 5-HT3 antagonists, such as ondansetron, granisetron, and tropisetron, are important antiemetic agents. They are particularly important in treating the nausea and vomiting that occur during anticancer chemotherapy using cytotoxic drugs. Another application is in the treatment of postoperative nausea and vomiting. Other
Document 13 (Title: Effects of a secondary and a tertiary amine tricyclic antidepressant on cerebral biogenic amines as a function of mouse strain: a comparative neurotoxicological evaluation.): The effect of equal-dose regimens of amitriptyline and nortriptyline on the concentrations of serotonin, dopamine and major acidic metabolites was compared in 5 distinct brain regions as a function of inbred mouse strain. Amitriptyline increased to a greater extent the regional brain serotonin levels in the albino BALB/c mouse than did nortriptyline. Both drugs increased serotonin levels but decreased cerebral 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid levels in some distinct brain regions of the black C57BL/6 mouse strain. The results suggest a strain-dependent differential increase in brain serotonin turnover in specific mouse strain brain regions which may account for the greater incidence of amitriptyline-induced sedation and seizures. The BALB/c mouse was also found to be more sensitive than the C57BL/6 strain to the action of both drugs on dopamine and major acidic metabolites with amitriptyline showing more regional brain potency than nortriptyline. The data suggest an increase in dopamine turnover particularly in brain areas associated with motor function and posture which may account for tricyclic-antidepressant-induced extrapyramidal disorders. The results also indicate that the C57BL/6 mouse strain may be of experimental value for studying the mechanism underlying tricyclic-induced adverse reactions relevant to sedation and movement disorders as a function of genetic predisposition.
Document 14 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): PART 18 Poisoning, Drug Overdose, and Envenomation 473e-6 in theophylline overdose. For poisons with central dopaminergic effects (methamphetamine, phencyclidine) manifested by psychotic behavior, a dopamine receptor antagonist, such as haloperidol, may be useful. In anticholinergic and cyanide poisoning, specific antidotal therapy may be necessary. The treatment of seizures secondary to cerebral ischemia or edema or to metabolic abnormalities should include correction of the underlying cause. Neuromuscular paralysis is indicated in refractory cases. Electroencephalographic monitoring and continuing treatment of seizures are necessary to prevent permanent neurologic damage. Serotonergic receptor overstimulation in serotonin syndrome may be treated with cyproheptadine. Other Measures Temperature extremes, metabolic abnormalities, hepatic and renal dysfunction, and secondary complications should be treated by standard therapies.
Document 15 (Title: Amitriptyline -- Toxicity): Amitriptyline toxicity is measurable by a dose of over 5 mg/kg. The clinical symptoms of amitriptyline toxicity include neurological, cardiac, and anticholinergic adverse reactions. Neurological symptoms include sedation, seizure, and coma. Cardiac symptoms include tachycardia, hypotension, conduction abnormalities, and QTc prolongation. Anticholinergic symptoms include dilated pupils, dry mouth, decreased (or absent) bowel sounds, and urinary retention.
