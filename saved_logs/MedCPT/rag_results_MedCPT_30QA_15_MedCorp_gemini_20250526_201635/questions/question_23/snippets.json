After 4 weeks, the dosage of nicorandil was increased from 10 mg b.i.d. to 20 mg b.i.d., but the recommended dosage of nifedipine, 20 mg b.i.d., was kept constant during the study period. Double-blind treatment was preceded by a 2-week prephase during which patients were treated with isosorbide dinitrate. During the study period, patients were asked to report the rate of anginal attacks and consumption of sublingual nitroglycerin. Measurements of blood pressure and heart rate at rest and during exercise always were performed 2 h after drug intake. Fifty-eight patients were randomized--29 to nicorandil and 29 to nifedipine. There were large individual variations in anginal attack rates, which makes group comparisons difficult, but in the nicorandil group, the anginal attack rate decreased significantly compared with baseline frequency. Systolic blood pressure at rest was reduced significantly only with the highest dose of nicorandil, but nifedipine had a significant effect on both systolic and diastolic blood pressures as well as on the heart rate. Both treatments significantly increased exercise duration, time to onset of angina pectoris, and time to 1-mm ST depression. In the nicorandil group, an improvement was noted with the 20-mg dose compared with the 10-mg dose, but no significant differences were noted between the nicorandil and nifedipine groups after either 4 or 8 weeks of treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "content": "Nitrates are used extensively for the treatment of angina pectoris. However, continuous therapy with either oral nitrates or nitroglycerin patches leads to rapid development of tolerance, with loss or diminution of antianginal and anti-ischemic effects. The only practical way to avoid the development of tolerance is to use intermittent daily therapy with nitrates. Nitroglycerin patches applied for 10-12 hours during the day increase exercise duration for 8-12 hours, but a rebound increase in anginal attacks during the nitrate-free interval may occur. Oral isosorbide-5-mononitrate, 20 mg twice a day, with the first dose administered in the morning and the second dose 7 hours later, increases exercise duration for at least 12 hours without the development of tolerance to either the morning or afternoon dose. This dosing regimen has been shown not to produce a rebound phenomenon during the periods of low nitrate levels at night and early hours of the morning. Isosorbide dinitrate (30 mg) prescribed at 7 AM and 1 PM does not produce tolerance to the 7 AM dose, but effects of the afternoon dose have not been evaluated. Recent data suggest that isosorbide dinitrate given 3 or 4 times daily produces tolerance and this dosing schedule is inadequate for antianginal prophylaxis. It should be recognized that intermittent oral or patch therapy with nitrates during the day leaves the patient unprotected at night and early hours of the morning.

        "contents": "Nitroglycerin -- Indications. Nitroglycerin is a vasodilatory drug used primarily\u00a0to provide relief\u00a0from anginal chest pain.\u00a0Nitroglycerin has been FDA approved since 2000 and was first sold as a brand-name agent. It is currently FDA approved for the acute relief of an attack or acute prophylaxis of angina pectoris secondary to coronary artery\u00a0disease. Off-label, non-FDA-approved\u00a0uses include\u00a0treatment for\u00a0hypertensive urgency/emergency, coronary artery spasm, angina secondary to cocaine use, congestive heart failure (CHF), and chronic anal fissures. Along with hydralazine as a combination therapy, it is also indicated in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection in whom ACE inhibitors are contraindicated. Nitroglycerin is occasionally given to reduce radial spasms during coronary angiography through the radial approach.\u00a0 Nitroglycerin was first used in 1879 as a treatment for angina and since it has been part of management to relieve anginal chest pain.
