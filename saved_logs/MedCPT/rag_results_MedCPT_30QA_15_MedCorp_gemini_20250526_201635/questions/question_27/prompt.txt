Document 1 (Title: Neurology_Adams): The internal carotid artery also supplies the optic nerve and retina. For this reason, transient monocular blindness occurs prior to the onset of stroke in 10 to 25 percent of cases of symptomatic carotid occlusion. Yet central retinal artery ischemia is a relatively rare manifestation of carotid artery occlusion, presumably because of efficient collateral supply in the globe.
Document 2 (Title: [Optic nerve hemangioblastoma. Case report].): A solitary hemangioblastoma of the optic nerve was found in a 36-year-old male with a distinct family history of intracranial hemangioblastoma. The patient was admitted with complaints of visual loss and exophthalmos of the right eye. X-rays showed enlargement of the right optic canal. Right carotid angiography revealed a hypervascular tumor in the orbital apex, supplied by the ophthalmic artery. Computed tomography disclosed a pear-shaped, isodense mass with moderate contrast enhancement in the orbital apex. The right optic nerve was enlarged along its entire course and was involved with the apical mass. Surgery via the right frontal extradural approach disclosed a solid, vascular tumor involving the optic nerve at the apex of the orbit. Histological examination showed the tumor to be a characteristic hemangioblastoma. Over 90% of intracranial hemangioblastomas are located in the posterior fossa. Supratentorial hemangioblastomas, especially those arising in the optic nerve, are extremely rare. In addition, optic nerve hemangioblastomas are frequently familial and are associated with infratentorial hemangioblastomas, angiomatosis retinae, and cysts of the abdominal viscera.
Document 3 (Title: Hyperbaric Treatment of Central Retinal Artery Occlusion -- Etiology): Arterial supply to the eye is via the ophthalmic artery, a branch of the cavernous portion of the internal carotid artery. The central retinal artery enters the globe along with the optic nerve and serves the inner layers of the retina through its many branches. Fifteen percent to 30% of the population have a cilioretinal artery, part of the choroidal arterial supply. This supplies the area of the retina around the macula, which is the central vision area. Patients with a cilioretinal artery may still have preserved central vision because this portion of the retina is still being perfused.
Document 4 (Title: Fraternal Order of Eagles): As of 2019, membership is open to any person of good moral character, and believes in the existence of a supreme being, and is not a member of the Communist Party nor any organization which advocates the overthrow of the United States government. Currently, either gender can become a member of an Aerie, however, only women can become a member of an Auxiliary. In recent history, numerous Aerie chapters have absorbed their Auxiliaries to form one unified chapter that allows all genders, to which the Grand Aerie and Grand Auxiliary responded with enacting a law that any Auxiliary members who wish to leave the women's only chapter and join the Aerie, must be a non-member of the entire organization for one full year, which has discouraged countless members from doing so.
Document 5 (Title: Anatomy_Gray): In the orbit the ophthalmic artery gives off numerous branches as follows: the lacrimal artery, which arises from the ophthalmic artery on the lateral side of the optic nerve, and passes anteriorly on the lateral side of the orbit, supplying the lacrimal gland, muscles, the anterior ciliary branch to the eyeball, and the lateral sides of the eyelid; the central retinal artery, which enters the optic nerve, proceeds down the center of the nerve to the retina, and is clearly seen when viewing the retina with an ophthalmoscope—occlusion of this vessel or of the parent artery leads to blindness; the long and short posterior ciliary arteries, which are branches that enter the eyeball posteriorly, piercing the sclera, and supplying structures inside the eyeball; the muscular arteries, which are branches supplying the intrinsic muscles of the eyeball; the supra-orbital artery, which usually arises from the ophthalmic artery immediately after it has crossed the optic nerve, proceeds
Document 6 (Title: Neuroanatomy, Retina -- Blood Supply and Lymphatics): The retina demonstrates the highest rate of oxygen consumption of any tissue in the human body and, therefore, requires a steady and large volume of oxygenated hemoglobin to nourish it. The retina possesses a dual blood supply to accommodate this high demand; it receives supply by the choroid and the branches of the ophthalmic artery. Blood leaves the heart from the aorta and enters the common carotid artery, which divides into the internal and external carotid vessels. From this junction, the internal carotid enters the skull and just distal to the cavernous sinus, the first tributary off of the internal carotid is the ophthalmic artery. The ophthalmic artery gives rise to both the central retinal artery and the posterior ciliary arteries which supply the retina from different angles. The central retinal artery is the first branch of the ophthalmic artery and runs inside the dura just beneath the optic nerve, and travels with the optic nerve through the optic disc and supplies the cells in the macula. The posterior ciliary artery divides into the short and long posterior ciliary arteries that penetrate through the sclera and provide blood flow to the posterior uveal tract. Blood flow to the retina remains constant regardless of intraocular pressure, systemic blood pressure, and is independent of sympathetic autoregulation. Instead, retinal blood flowregulation is by local factors such as nitric oxide, prostaglandins, endothelin, but most importantly, arterial carbon dioxide tension. Much akin to the brain, retinal blood flow will increase in response to increased carbon dioxide and decrease in response to lower levels of carbon dioxide. The two branches are the posterior ciliary arteries which supply the outer and middle retina and the central retinal arteries which supply the inner retina. The choroid is the posterior part of the uveal tract that nourishes the outer layers of the retina. The choroid itself gets blood from the long and short posterior ciliary arteries. Capillaries are found within all parts of the retina from the innermost nerve fiber layer to the outermost outer plexiform layer and occasionally in the outer nuclear layer. Nutrients from the vasculature of the choriocapillaris behind the pigment epithelium layer supply the delicate photoreceptor layer. The photoreceptors and the larger portion of the outer plexiform layer obtain nourishment from the choriocapillaris indirectly, as opposed to the inner retinal layers which receive supply from the superficial and deep capillary plexuses formed by branches of the central artery of the retina. Inner layers of the retina are known to show the highest sensitivity to hypoxic challenges, whereas the outer retina exhibits greater resistance to hypoxic stress. [2]
Document 7 (Title: Central retinal and posterior ciliary artery occlusion after particle embolization of the external carotid artery system.): A 15-year-old boy underwent neuroradiologic embolization of the left internal maxillary artery with polyvinyl alcohol to stop traumatic epistaxis after failure of surgical clipping and nasal packing. Selective catheterization of the external carotid artery before embolization showed a faint choroidal blush. Although the procedure provided hemostasis, embolization to the central retinal artery and ciliary arteries resulted in loss of vision. The route of the emboli to the eye was via the anastomotic network of the lacrimal artery supplied by the external carotid artery system. Neuroradiologic embolization of the external carotid artery is an effective mode of therapy for dural-cavernous fistulas when fed by the external carotid artery system. Because the blood flow to the brain and eye is predominantly supplied by the internal carotid artery, embolization of the external carotid artery is considered relatively safe. The authors document the importance of recognition of the choroidal blush during selective external carotid artery angiography as a sign of collateral blood flow to the eye. Physicians and patients need to be aware of the risk of blindness as a complication of external carotid artery embolization when this sign is present.
Document 8 (Title: Anatomy, Head and Neck, Eye -- Nerves): The optic nerve is the sensory nerve that transmits impulses from the retina to the brain. The oculomotor , trochlear, and abducens nerve innervate the extraocular muscles. The oculomotor nerve has The ophthalmic nerve branches into the lacrimal, frontal, and nasociliary nerves. The lacrimal nerve runs to the lacrimal glands and branches off to other areas. The frontal nerve supplies sensation to the superior eyelid and forehead. The nasociliary nerve is the sensory nerve to the eyeball. [7] [8]
Document 9 (Title: Carotid embolization presenting as total monocular blindness.): Blindness suddenly developed in the right eye of a 55-year-old man. There had been no antecedent illness suggestive of cardiovascular disease. Funduscopic examination eight hours later showed findings consistent with central retinal artery thrombosis. After an arteriogram showed an ulcerated plaque at the bifurcation of the right common carotid artery, the patient underwent thromboendarterectomy. The specimen contained an ulcer, presumably the nidus of an embolus to the central retinal artery. The patient's vision did not recover. This case demonstrates that, although it is rare, total monocular blindness may be caused by a large embolus from a carotid artery plaque.

Document 11 (Title: Neurology_Adams): The vascular supply of the eye is through the ophthalmic branch of the internal carotid artery that supplies the retina, posterior (uveal) coats of the eye, and optic nerve head. This artery gives origin to the posterior ciliary arteries; the latter form a rich circumferential plexus of vessels (arterial circle of Zinn-Haller) located deep to the lamina cribrosa. The lamina cribrosa is a sieve-like scleral (dural) structure through which the axons of the central and nasal part of the disc run. This arterial circle supplies the optic disc and adjacent part of the distal optic nerve, the choroid, and the ciliary body; it anastomoses with the pial arterial plexus that surrounds the optic nerve. The other major branch of the ophthalmic artery is the central retinal artery. It issues from the optic disc, where it divides into four branches that supply the inner retinal layers; it is these vessels and their branches that are visible by ophthalmoscopy. A short distance from the disc, these
Document 12 (Title: Fraternal Order of Eagles): Structure and Organization Local units are called "Aeries". There were 1,400 Aeries scattered across the US and Canada in 2001. The national convention is known as the "Grand Aerie" and meets annually. "Grand Aerie" is also the name of the headquarters of the organization, currently at Grove City, Ohio. Aeries are known by their instituting number and the name of the city in which they are located. The Aerie instituting number is appointed based on the order in which an Aerie is instituted; at current date the Grand Aerie is instituting Aeries in the 4500 range. Aerie #1, located in Seattle, Washington, is sometimes referred to as "The Mother Aerie". The Grand Aerie Fraternal Order of Eagles International Convention is held each year in a different city in either the United States or Canada. During the International Convention, delegates from all Aeries and Auxiliaries vote on the new Grand Aerie and Grand Auxiliary representatives, new by-laws and other relevant issues. Officers
Document 13 (Title: VG Cats): Aeris Aeris was blue-eyed female cat with pink fur. She had a hot temper and lashed out at Leo frequently. Aeris was introduced on September 4, 2001 in Strip 2, "Pika?". Leo Leonardo, The Third Leo Leonardo, The Third was a green-eyed male cat with grey fur. Leo was named after one of Ramsoomair's real cats; Ramsoomair describes the association as "in name only." Ramsoomair euthanized the real-life cat Leo on July 19, 2010. Leo was introduced on September 4, 2001 in Strip 1, "Feelin' Gassy". Pantsman The alter ego of Scott Ramsoomair, Pantsman is an incompetent superhero who concealed his identity by wearing trousers and sometimes underpants on his head. His greatest weakness is vodka cooler, which causes him to drop his trousers and transform into "Peter Pantsless". He also wore a pair of jeans around his neck, to provide a two tailed cape. He was introduced in Strip 37, "I Like Bunnies", to help explain the inconsistent updating of the comic. Animated series
Document 14 (Title: The Fallen (series)): Aaron must prove to the citizens of Aerie that he is indeed the chosen one, a hard enough task when he is unsure himself. An ancient, wise, and gentle Fallen Angel named Belphegor helps Aaron to fully unite his human and angelic natures. While in the process of becoming whole, Aaron hears Vilma's pleas for help and instinctively goes to her rescue, not realizing that it could be a trap. Despite overwhelming odds, he battles Verchiel and the Powers to save Vilma. Aaron meets Malak and realizes that it is his little brother Stevie who has been changed somehow; however, he cannot bring himself to kill his own brother. Aaron rescues Vilma and takes her back to Aerie, but the battle follows him and he loses many friends and loved ones.
Document 15 (Title: Blindness following paranasal sinus surgery: a report of two cases.): Two cases of blindness following paranasal sinus surgery are presented. The first patient, a 38-year old man, developed a delayed massive haemorrhage, after bilateral sphenoethmoidectomy. This hemorrhage could be stopped by electric cauterisation under endoscopical control. During this reintervention the patient developed total blindness of his right eye, and a restriction of the inferotemporal left visual field. The second patient, a 10-year old girl, developed, after bilateral spheno-ethmoidectomy for isolated sphenoiditis, total blindness of the left eye and paralysis of the ipsilateral extraocular muscles. According to the literature, blindness secondary to paranasal surgery is mainly due to retrobulbar hemorrhage. In the first case blindness was due to a direct cauterisation of the optic nerve, after perforation of the lamina papyracea. In the second case, blindness was probably due to a hemorrhage in the orbital apex.

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
Question: Following endaerectomy on the right common carotid, a patient is found to be blind in the right eye. It is appears that a small thrombus embolized during surgery and lodged in the aery supplying the optic nerve. Which aery would be blocked?
Options:
A. Central aery of the retina
B. Infraorbital aery
C. Lacrimal aery
D. Nasociliary aretry
