While a subdiaphragmatic abscess can be drained percutaneously, a pelvic abscess is accessed transrectally or transvaginally. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided drainage provides a safe and effective minimally invasive treatment option. [69] [70] Transesophageal and transgastric approaches have been used for a subphrenic abscess. [71] Splenic abscesses have been traditionally treated with splenectomy, but percutaneous drainage has been correlated with lower mortality and complication rates. [72] Results from a study showed that abscess size, age, inflammatory markers, leukocytosis, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were predictive of the need for surgical intervention due to failure of pharmacologic treatment.

Systemic inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-6 have been shown to be similar in transgastric and transcolonic NOTES when compared to laparoscopy in por-cine models.83 Concerns about the safety of transluminal access and limitations in equipment remain the greatest barriers to expansion. To date, the most headline-grabbing procedures have been the transvaginal and transgastric removal of the gallbladder84-86 (Fig. 14-25). To ensure safety, all human cases",
