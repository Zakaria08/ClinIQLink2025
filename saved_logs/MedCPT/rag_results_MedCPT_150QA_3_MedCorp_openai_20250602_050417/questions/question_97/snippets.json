        "title": "Urgent therapy for stroke. Part II. Pilot study of tissue plasminogen activator administered 91-180 minutes from onset.",
        "content": "Renewed interest in thrombolytic therapy as potential treatment for patients with acute ischemic stroke prompted a dose-escalation safety study of tissue plasminogen activator in patients with very early (less than or equal to 90 minutes; see Part I) neurological symptoms. To test whether this stringent entry window might be safely lengthened, a second study was organized to test tissue plasminogen activator in patients with symptoms of 91-180 minutes' duration before treatment. An open-label, dose-escalation design was chosen. Eligible patients had pretreatment head computerized tomographic scanning and treatment begun 91-180 minutes from stroke onset. End points examined included the incidence of symptomatic and asymptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, other bleeding, and clinical outcome at 2 hours, 24 hours, and 3 months after treatment. Twenty patients were treated at three hospitals in 13 months. Three doses were tested: 0.6 mg/kg (n = 8), 0.85 mg/kg (n = 6), and 0.95 mg/kg (n = 6). Two patients, one each at the two highest doses, sustained fatal intracerebral hemorrhages. Three patients (15%) improved by greater than or equal to 4 points on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale by 24 hours. These observations suggest that tissue plasminogen activator treatment of acute ischemic stroke 91-180 minutes from onset in doses of greater than or equal to 0.85 mg/kg is attended by a risk of intracerebral hemorrhage approximating 17% (range 3-44%, 95% confidence interval). The rate of early neurological improvement observed in this study was small but does not exclude an improvement over the natural history. Future study with placebo control subjects and stratification by time to treatment is indicated.",

        "content": "No studies have examined the effect of statins on cognition in patients with prior stroke. However, two large studies (HPS and PROSPER) that included people with vascular diseases reported that simvastatin and pravastatin did not impact cognition. Statins have been studied for improving operative outcomes in cardiac and vascular surgery. Mortality and adverse cardiovascular events were reduced in statin groups. Older adults who receive statin therapy at time of discharge from the hospital after an inpatient stay have been studied. People with cardiac ischemia not previously on statins at the time of admission have a lower risk of major cardiac adverse events and hospital readmission two years post-hospitalization. Comparative effectiveness While no direct comparison exists, all statins appear effective regardless of potency or degree of cholesterol reduction. Simvastatin and pravastatin appear to have a reduced incidence of side-effects.",

        "content": "In a trial of statins, the institution of high doses of drug reduced the incidence of subsequent stroke after a TIA or first stroke by 2 percent over 5 years (see Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Investigators [SPARCL trial]). Other large studies with lower doses of statin drugs have not shown this effect. These findings with high doses have, at the moment, been adopted into routine practice. Recent guidelines encourage LDL concentrations of less than 70 mg/dL for secondary stroke prevention. Early anticoagulation after an acute stroke carries an uncertain risk of hemorrhagic transformation of an ischemic infarct. In particular, patients with very large cerebral infarcts that have a component of deep (basal ganglionic) tissue damage, especially in those patients who are also hypertensive, there may be a risk of anticoagulant-related hemorrhage into the acute infarct—“hemorrhagic conversion” (Shields et al).",
