Document 1 (Title: Pinworm (parasite)): The pinworm (species Enterobius vermicularis), also known as threadworm (in the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand) or seatworm, is a parasitic worm. It is a nematode (roundworm) and a common intestinal parasite or helminth, especially in humans. The medical condition associated with pinworm infestation is known as pinworm infection (enterobiasis) (a type of helminthiasis) or less precisely as oxyuriasis in reference to the family Oxyuridae.
Document 2 (Title: Enterobius Vermicularis -- Etiology): Infection most commonly occurs in children, but any individual is susceptible to E. vermicularis infection. People from tropical climates and school-aged children are the most vulnerable. Infection is caused by the ingestion of the pinworm eggs. Transmission is most commonly through the fecal-oral route. [3] Risk factors for pinworms include poor hygiene, eating after touching contaminated items and living with an individual who is identified as egg positive.
Document 3 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Diagnosis and Treatment The characteristic 50by 20-μm lemon-shaped Trichuris eggs are readily detected on stool examination. Adult worms, which are 3–5 cm long, are occasionally seen on proctoscopy. Mebendazole (500 mg once) or albendazole (400 mg daily for 3 doses) is safe and moderately effective for treatment, with cure rates of 70–90%. Ivermectin (200 μg/kg daily for 3 doses) is also safe but is not quite as efficacious as the benzimidazoles. E. vermicularis is more common in temperate countries than in the tropics. In the United States, ~40 million persons are infected with pinworms, with a disproportionate number of cases among children.

2. The laying of eggs by female pinworms occurs 3 months after human infection
3. There may be moderate hypereosinophilia during oxyuriasis
4. The adult pinworm can be evacuated through the mouth
5. Flubendazole (FLUVERMAL®) is a medication used in oxyuriasis
