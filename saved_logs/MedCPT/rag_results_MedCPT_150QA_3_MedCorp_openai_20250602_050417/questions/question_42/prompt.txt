Document 1 (Title: Obstentrics_Williams): The rubella virus is one of the most complete teratogens, and efects of fetal infection are worst during organogenesis (Adams Waldorf, 2013). Pregnant women with rubella and a rash during the first 12 weeks of gestation have an afected fetus with congenital infection in up to 90 percent of cases (Miller, 1982). At 13 to 14 weeks' gestation, this incidence is 50 percent, and by the end of the second trimester, it is 25 percent. Defects are rare after 20 weeks' gestation. Features of congenital rubella syndrome amenable to prenatal diagnosis are cardiac septal defects, pulmonary stenosis, microcephaly, cataracts, microphthalmia, and hepatosplenomegaly (Yazigi, 2017). Other abnormalities include sensorineural deafness, intellectual disability, neonatal purpura, and radiolucent bone disease. Neonates born with congenital rubela may shed the virus or many months and thus be a threat to other inants and to susceptible adults who contact them. Reports of delayed morbidities associated with
Document 2 (Title: Trilogy of Fallot): The Trilogy of Fallot also called Fallot's trilogy is a rare congenital heart disease consisting of the following defects: pulmonary valve stenosis, right ventricular hypertrophy and atrial septal defect. It occurs in 1.2% of all congenital heart defects. A 1960 case report of 22 patients who underwent surgery showed an excess of females with a ratio of 3:2, with the youngest person being 7 months old and the oldest being 50 years old. Symptoms and signs Mechanism Trilogy of Fallot is a combination of three congenital heart defects: pulmonary stenosis, right ventricular hypertrophy, and an atrial septal defect. The first two of these are also found in the more common tetralogy of Fallot. However, the tetralogy has a ventricular septal defect instead of an atrial one, and it also involves an overriding aorta The Three Malformations Diagnosis Diagnosis is done via echocardiography or angiography.
Document 3 (Title: [The incidence of heart defects in children].): By examining all of 91,823 children born in 1980 in Bohemia, congenital heart disease was proved in 589 (6.415/1000 liveborns) and cardiomyopathy in 24 (0.261/1000 liveborns). Further 166 (1.808/1000 liveborns) were follow-up with a diagnosis of congenital heart disease by pediatric cardiologists in the field, but at the age of 4 years we didn't prove the defect any more. Prevalence of heart defects: ventricular septal defect (31.4%), atrial septal defect (11.4%), aortic stenosis (7.6%), pulmonary stenosis (7.1%), coarctation of the aorta (5.8%), transposition of the great arteries (5.4%), patent ductus arteriosus (4.8%), atrioventricular canal and hypoplastic left heart (4.1%), tetralogy of Fallot (3.6%). Other defects occurred less frequently than in 2.5% of all congenital heart disease.

Question: A male neonate is being examined by a pediatrician. His mother informs the doctor that she had a mild fever with rash, muscle pain, and swollen and tender lymph nodes during the second month of gestation. The boy was born at 39 weeks gestation via spontaneous vaginal delivery with no prenatal care. On physical examination, the neonate has normal vital signs. Retinal examination reveals the findings shown in the image. Which of the following congenital heart defects is most likely to be present in this neonate?
Options:
A. Atrial septal defect
B. Ventricular septal defect
C. Tetralogy of Fallot
D. Patent ductus arteriosus
