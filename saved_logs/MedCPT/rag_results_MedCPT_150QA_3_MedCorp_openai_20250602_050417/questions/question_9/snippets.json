        "content": "Rate control is the preferred strategy for all asymptomatic AF patients. Guidelines on target heart rate in patients selected for rate control are lacking. A previously conducted randomized trial (RACE II) to assess heart rate goal in patients with AF showed no outcome difference between lenient and strict heart rate control; however, sufficient evidence to assess the impact on all-cause mortality was lacking. Physicians usually attempt to control heart rate control with agents such as beta-blockers (metoprolol, esmolol, propranolol), nondihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers (verapamil, diltiazem), or digoxin. All 3 classes of drugs are given intravenously (IV) for acute rate control and can be switched to oral therapy for chronic management. In patients with chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, carvedilol therapy has shown significant improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction. Due to the negative inotropic properties of calcium channel blockers, physicians do not use these not preferred in such patients. Digoxin is usually reserved for patients who do not achieve rate control with beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers alone. Amiodarone can be used as second-line therapy when treatment with other agents has failed. [23] In patients refractory to medical therapy, AV node ablation with a permanent pacemaker placement can effectively control and regularize ventricular heart rate. Low doses of magnesium have shown synergistic effects on rate control.

        "content": "A 69-year-old retired teacher presents with a 1-month history of palpitations, intermittent shortness of breath, and fatigue. She has a history of hypertension. An electrocardiogram (ECG) shows atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response of 122 beats/min (bpm) and signs of left ventricular hypertrophy. She is anticoagulated with warfarin and started on sustained-release metoprolol, 50 mg/d. After 7 days, her rhythm reverts to normal sinus rhythm spontaneously. However, over the ensuing month, she continues to have intermittent palpita-tions and fatigue. Continuous ECG recording over a 48-hour period documents paroxysms of atrial fibrillation with heart rates of 88–114 bpm. An echocardiogram shows a left ven-tricular ejection fraction of 38% (normal ≥ 60%) with no localized wall motion abnormality. At this stage, would you initiate treatment with an antiarrhythmic drug to maintain normal sinus rhythm, and if so, what drug would you choose?",

On physical examination, the patient’s blood pressure is 145/90 mm Hg, and her heart rate is 80 bpm. She is in no acute distress, and there are no other significant physical findings; an electrocardiogram is normal except for slight left ventricular hypertrophy.
