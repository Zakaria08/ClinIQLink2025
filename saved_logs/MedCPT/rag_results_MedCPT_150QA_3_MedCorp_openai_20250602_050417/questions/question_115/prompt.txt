Document 1 (Title: Paracetamol): Treatment is aimed at removing the paracetamol from the body and replenishing glutathione. Activated charcoal can be used to decrease absorption of paracetamol if the person comes to the hospital soon after the overdose. While the antidote, acetylcysteine (also called N-acetylcysteine or NAC), acts as a precursor for glutathione, helping the body regenerate enough to prevent or at least decrease the possible damage to the liver; a liver transplant is often required if damage to the liver becomes severe. NAC was usually given following a treatment nomogram (one for people with risk factors, and one for those without), but the use of the nomogram is no longer recommended as evidence to support the use of risk factors was poor and inconsistent, and many of the risk factors are imprecise and difficult to determine with sufficient certainty in clinical practice. Toxicity of paracetamol is due to its quinone metabolite NAPQI and NAC also helps in neutralizing it. Kidney failure is also a
Document 2 (Title: Valproate Toxicity -- Treatment / Management): Other interventions to consider early for patients with valproate toxicity are gastrointestinal decontamination and lavage. If the patient presents within 2 hours of a valproate overdose, activated charcoal may be used for gastrointestinal decontamination. Valproate is available in enteric-coated and extended-release formulations, which have slow absorption. Administration of activated charcoal may be considered beyond 2 hours from ingestion for patients who have taken enteric-coated and extended-release valproate formulations. [25] The dose of activated charcoal is 1 g/kg of body weight. If the patient cannot swallow reliably, the administration of activated charcoal should be withheld. Gastric lavage may also be considered to eliminate valproate from the digestive tract. Food and Drug Administration guidelines indicate that gastric lavage treatment may be effective up to 10 or 12 hours after drug intake. [26]
Document 3 (Title: Recent developments in the management of paracetamol (acetaminophen) poisoning.): Paracetamol (acetaminophen) poisoning accounts for almost a third of admissions to our district poisons unit, and is the commonest cause of death in such patients. Antidotal treatment may be effective up to 10h after overdose with oral methionine or up to 24h with acetylcysteine (not 15h as previously suggested for the latter). Patients taking paracetamol overdose while also receiving drugs which induce hepatic enzymes are more susceptible to liver damage, and antidotal treatment may be necessary at lower plasma paracetamol concentrations (50% of the normal treatment line). As survival following liver transplantation is now increasing, it is important to identify early prognostic indicators in fulminant hepatic failure, so that those patients with a high chance of fatal outcome can be considered for transplantation. Useful indicators are the presence of acidosis, marked prolongation of prothrombin time or a continued rise in prothrombin time on day 4 after the overdose. There is no evidence that paracetamol o...

Question: Select the correct statement(s) regarding paracetamol poisoning:
Options:
1. Early administration of activated charcoal decreases the bioavailability of paracetamol
2. N-acetylcysteine used orally, in combination with activated charcoal, loses its detoxifying activity
3. Acute tubular nephropathy constitutes an early sign of intoxication
4. Early gastric lavage constitutes an essential therapeutic measure
5. The toxifying metabolic pathway uses cytochrome P450
