Document 1 (Title: Case Study: 33-Year-Old Female Presents with Chronic SOB and Cough (Archived) -- Case Presentation): History of Present Illness: A 33-year-old white female presents after admission to the general medical/surgical hospital ward with a chief complaint of shortness of breath on exertion. She reports that she was seen for similar symptoms previously at her primary care physician’s office six months ago. At that time, she was diagnosed with acute bronchitis and treated with bronchodilators, empiric antibiotics, and a short course oral steroid taper.

Document 3 (Title: [A case of idiopathic hypoparathyroidism complicated with chronic thyroiditis].): It has been suggested that autoimmunity and genetic factors may play a specific role in the development of idiopathic hypoparathyroidism. We reported a case of idiopathic hypoparathyroidism complicated with chronic thyroiditis. The patient, a woman 40 years old, visited our clinic because of tetany of both hands and dizziness. She was of short stature with a round face. She also had a goiter, hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia and decreased parathyroidal function, but renal function was normal. Her TSH level was slightly high with a positive microsome test (x 1600), and the levels of thyroid hormones tended to be low. Based on Ellsworth-Howard test findings, a diagnosis of idiopathic hypoparathyroidism was made, with the complication of chronic thyroiditis confirmed by the thyroidal biopsy. Administration of l alpha-OH-D3 normalized the level of serum calcium. No special treatment was given for the chronic thyroiditis in order to observe its natural course. Her TSH returned to normal, and the level of thyroid ho...
