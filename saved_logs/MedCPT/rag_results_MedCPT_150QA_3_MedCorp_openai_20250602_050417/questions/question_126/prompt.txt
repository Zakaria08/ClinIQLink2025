With your own knowledge and the help of the following document:

Document 1 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): Cefotetan, cefoxitin: Intravenous, second-generation drugs, activity versus Bacteroides fragilis allows for use in abdominal/pelvic infections Ceftriaxone: Intravenous, third-generation drug, mixed clearance with long half-life (6 hours), good CNS penetration, many uses including pneumonia, meningitis, pyelonephritis, and gonorrhea Cefotaxime: Intravenous, third-generation, similar to ceftriaxone; however, clearance is renal and half-life is 1 hour Ceftazidime: Intravenous, third-generation drug, poor Gram-positive activity, good activity versus Pseudomonas aeruginosa Cefepime: Intravenous, fourth-generation drug, broad activity with improved stability to chromosomal β-lactamases Ceftaroline: Intravenous, active against methicillin-resistant staphylococci, broad Gram-negative activity not including Pseudomonas aeruginosa
Document 2 (Title: Clinical pharmacokinetics of ceftriaxone.): Ceftriaxone is a third-generation cephalosporin that exhibits saturable plasma protein binding, which influences its pharmacokinetic parameters depending on the dose. Systemic clearance and volume of distribution of total drug show dependence on both concentration and time, whereas for unbound drug these parameters remain constant. The decrease in renal or non-renal clearance with age or in the presence of disease states is often compensated by the concurrent increase in free fraction, resulting in no apparent changes in half-life and no need for dose adjustment. Because of its unusually long plasma half-life, the availability of intramuscular administration and its high intrinsic activity against many organisms, ceftriaxone has become a popular agent in once-daily therapy of infections in paediatric patients, gonococcal infections and outpatient management of pneumonia and osteomyelitis.
Document 3 (Title: Cephalosporins -- Administration -- Available Dosage Forms, Strengths, and Adult Dosages): First-generation: Cefazolin, cephalothin, and cephapirin are administered parenterally. The administration route for cefadroxil and cephalexin is oral. Cephradine administration can be parenteral or oral. Second-generation: Cefuroxime can be administered parenterally or orally. Cefprozil is administered orally. Cefmetazole, cefotetan, and cefoxitin are administered parenterally. Third-generation: Cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone administration via the parenteral route. Cefdinir, cefixime, and cefpodoxime are administered orally. A single intramuscular shot of 125 or 250 mg of ceftriaxone effectively treats uncomplicated gonococcal infection or its complications, such as pelvic inflammatory disease or epididymo-orchitis. [23] [24] [25] Fourth-generation: Cefepime is administered parenterally. Fifth-generation: Ceftaroline is administered parenterally. Cefiderocol: Cefiderocol is administered parenterally. [13]
