With your own knowledge and the help of the following document:

Document 1 (Title: Fascioliasis -- Differential Diagnosis): Acute hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis, and shock liver will all have very significantly elevated transaminases, typically in the thousands. This is much high than the levels seen in fascioliasis which are usually in the hundreds. Toxocariasis, acute schistosomiasis, ascariasis, and strongyloidiasis, are all nearly indistinguishable from fascioliasis in the acute phase, especially in the presence of peripheral eosinophilia and pulmonary symptoms. Serologic testing is required to rule these out.
Document 2 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Parasitic Amebiasis, babesiosis, echinococcosis, fascioliasis, malaria, schistosomiasis, strongyloidiasis, toxocariasis, toxoplasmosis, trichinellosis, trypanosomiasis, visceral leishmaniasis Viral Colorado tick fever, coxsackievirus infection, cytomegalovirus infection, dengue, Epstein-Barr virus infection, hantavirus infection, hepatitis (A, B, C, D, E), herpes simplex, HIV infection, human herpesvirus 6 infection, parvovirus infection, West Nile virus infection Systemic rheumatic and autoimmune Ankylosing spondylitis, antiphospholipid syndrome, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, autoimmune hepatitis, Behçet’s diseases disease, cryoglobulinemia, dermatomyositis, Felty syndrome, gout, mixed connective-tissue disease, polymyositis, pseudogout, reactive arthritis, relapsing polychondritis, rheumatic fever, rheumatoid arthritis, Sjögren’s syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome
Document 3 (Title: [Opportunistic parasitic diseases in Africa. Clinical aspects and diagnosis].): Opportunistic parasitic infections are diagnosed more and more often in African patients with AIDS. Cryptosporidiosis is the most frequent with a prevalence between 7 and 31%. The prevalence of Isospora belli is between 5 and 19% and that of strongyloidiasis between 2 and 5%, depending on the authors. These parasitic infections are probably one of the frequent causes of chronic diarrhea in Africa. The prevalence of toxoplasmosis and pneumocystosis are not well known. (Between 5 and 17% for toxoplasmosis and 29% for pneumocystosis). The diagnostic technics used are those currently known. Toxoplasmosis and pneumocystosis seen in these patients have the same presentations as those in developed countries.
