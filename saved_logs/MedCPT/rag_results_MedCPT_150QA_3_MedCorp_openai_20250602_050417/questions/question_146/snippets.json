The dermatophytes are identified in 90% of the toenail and 50% of fingernail onychomycosis. [5] Candida albicans cases account for 2% of onychomycosis, especially in fingernails. Nondermatophytic mold onychomycosis is cultured primarily from toenails. Examples of these saprophytic molds include Fusarium, Aspergillus, Acremonium, Scytalidium, and Scopulariopsis brevicaulis, [6] accounting for about 8% of nail infections. [7]",
