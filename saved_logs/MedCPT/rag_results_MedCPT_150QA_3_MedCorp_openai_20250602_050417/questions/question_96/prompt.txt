Document 2 (Title: Symptomatic Carotid Artery Stenosis -- Introduction -- Carotid Artery Stenosis and Coronary Artery Disease): Given that carotid stenosis is an atherosclerotic process, it is not surprising that a significant portion of patients with severe carotid stenosis have concurrent coronary artery disease (CAD). In patients who need coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) and who are known to have severe (>70%) but asymptomatic carotid stenosis, the question arises regarding performing CEA before or at the same time as the CABG. A randomized control trial of 185 patients showed significant benefit for CEA either prior to or at the same time as CABG compared to patients who underwent CEA 1 to 3 months after CABG. The delayed CEA group had a significantly increased risk of perioperative or delayed stroke. [10]
Document 3 (Title: Single staged carotid and coronary arteries surgery. Indications and results.): The frequency of associated carotid and coronary stenosis is estimated to be 40% of cases including asymptomatic patients. The risk of death by myocardial infarction during carotid surgery is in the neighborhood of 1%. With Doppler and ultrasonic imaging, it is now possible to recognize carotid stenosis in 11% of these cases. Depending on the extent of the clinical manifestations caused by one or the other of these lesions, there are several therapeutic options: surgery of the carotid with special protection of the myocardium during and after surgery or simultaneous carotid and coronary surgery in high risk cases. Between 1979 and 1986, simultaneous surgery was performed in 18 cases in our department. During the same period, 1194 carotid endarterectomies and 505 coronary bypasses were performed. These 18 cases included 13 males and 5 females with a mean age of 62 years (range: 43 to 78 years). The procedure performed in these cases were 17 carotid endarterectomies, one bypass of the innominate artery and an a...
