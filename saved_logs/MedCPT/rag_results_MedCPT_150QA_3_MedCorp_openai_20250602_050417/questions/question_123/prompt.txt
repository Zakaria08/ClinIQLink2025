Document 1 (Title: Ascites): Monitoring diuresis: Diuresis can be monitored by weighing the person daily. The goal is weight loss of no more than 1.0 kg/day for people with both ascites and peripheral edema and no more than 0.5 kg/day for people with ascites alone. If daily weights cannot be obtained, diuretics can also be guided by the urinary sodium concentration. Dosage is increased until a negative sodium balance occurs. A random urine sodium-to-potassium ratio of > 1 is 90% sensitivity in predicting negative balance (> 78-mmol/day sodium excretion). Diuretic resistance: Diuretic resistance can be predicted by giving 80 mg intravenous furosemide after 3 days without diuretics and on an 80 mEq sodium/day diet. The urinary sodium excretion over 8 hours < 50 mEq/8 hours predicts resistance.
Document 2 (Title: Diabetic ketoacidosis.): The classic presentation of DKA, consisting of hyperglycemia, anion gap acidosis, and ketonuria, is readily recognized. The diagnosis may be missed, however, in the patient who is euglycemic, has a negative nitroprusside test for ketones, or has a nonanion gap metabolic acidosis. Treatment includes replacement of fluid and electrolytes lost through osmotic diuresis. Failure to recognize the magnitude of total-body potassium depletion and to begin replacement despite an initially normal serum potassium level may lead to fatal cardiac arrhythmia. Serum glucose must be monitored closely to avoid hypoglycemia; dextrose should be added to the infusion once the serum glucose falls to 250 mg per dl. Insulin is required to reverse ketoacid production by the liver; low-dose therapy is recommended. Ketogenesis may be reversed inadequately unless insulin treatment is continued until the anion gap has normalized. Failure to recognize precipitating causes may result in increased morbidity and mortality from underlying inf...
Document 3 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): a natriuresis occurs in response to an osmotic diuresis associated with hyperglycemia. Moreover, in patients with DKA, thirst is very common and water ingestion often continues. The plasma potassium concentration is usually mildly elevated, but in the face of acidosis, and as a result of the ongoing osmotic diuresis, a significant total-body deficit of potassium is almost always present. Recognition of the total-body deficit of potassium is critically important. The inclusion of potassium replacement in the therapeutic regimen at the appropriate time and with the appropriate indications (see below) is essential. Volume depletion is a very common finding in DKA and is a pivotal component in the pathogenesis of the disorder.
