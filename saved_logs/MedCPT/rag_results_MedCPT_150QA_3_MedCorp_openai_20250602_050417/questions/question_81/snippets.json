        "content": "of women undergoing IVF, the women who received acupuncture had increased cortisol levels and increased prolactin levels when compared to the controls, trending toward more normal cycle dynamics (63). More studies are needed both in the efficacy of acupuncture and infertility and in the mechanisms of action. Clinically speaking, there is provocative evidence that acupuncture appears safe in early pregnancy and is reasonable to support if patients are interested.",

        "content": "Fourteen patients with unilateral paralysis of the recurrent laryngeal nerve underwent a combined therapy which included acupuncture, phonopedics, respiratory muscle gymnastics, prozerin administration by means of sinusoidal modulated currents, and intramuscular injection of B1 and B6 vitamins. Before and after treatment the vocal function was assessed using indirect laryngoscopy, laryngostroboscopy, larynx tomography and thermography, larynx endophotography, voice tape recording, and maximum phonation time measurement. The combined treatment yielded good results in all patients in terms of the recovery of their vocal function. In 11 patients the recovery was reached within 2-3 weeks and in 3 remaining patients within 2-3 months. It is maintained that the recovery was expedited due to the beneficial effect of acupuncture and phonopedics.",

Writing in Science-Based Medicine, Gorski said that its findings highlight the conclusion that acupuncture is \"a theatrical placebo whose real history has been retconned beyond recognition.\" He also said this review \"reveals the many weaknesses in the design of acupuncture clinical trials\".",
