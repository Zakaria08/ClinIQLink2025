        "title": "[Prophylactic use of DDAVP in a patient with von Willebrand disease during labor: a case report and a review].",
        "content": "A Case of delivery in a 23-year-old woman after a prophylactic infusion of DDAVP is described. She had a life-long history of easy bruising and frequent epistaxis, with the diagnosis of vWD being made when she was 14 years old. A hemostatic examination showed a prolonged bleeding time, a moderate reduction in the factor VIII level (VIII: C) and von Willebrand Factor Antigen (vWF: Ag), decreased platelet aggregation by ristocetin, and depletion of platelet retention. In April, 1988, in the 34th week of pregnancy, she was admitted to our clinic in order to avoid abnormal bleeding during labor. On admission, the level of factor VIII, ristocetin aggregation, and platelet retention were normal, but the bleeding time remained prolonged. The diagnosis of vWD type I was made on the normal multimeric structure. The DDAVP infusion test revealed a shortening of the bleeding time and an increase in the vWF: Ag. In the 41st week of pregnancy, labor was induced, accompanied by infusion of DDAVP, she gave birth to an infant without any abnormal bleeding. Since conventional treatments with human plasma derivatives may cause complicating viral infections, we propose the infusion of DDAVP is one of the treatments to prevent the abnormal bleeding of the patient with vWD during labor.",

        "content": "Many patients are asymptomatic or may have mild symptoms and not have clearly impaired clotting, which might suggest a bleeding disorder. Often, the discovery of VWD occurs incidentally to other medical procedures requiring a blood work-up. Most cases of type 1 VWD are never diagnosed due to the asymptomatic or mild presentation of type I and most people usually end up leading a normal life free of complications, with many being unaware that they have the disorder. Trouble may, however, arise in some patients in the form of bleeding following surgery (including dental procedures), noticeable easy bruising, or menorrhagia (heavy menstrual periods). The minority of cases of type 1 may present with severe hemorrhagic symptoms. Type 2 Type 2 VWD (15-50% of cases) is a qualitative defect and the bleeding tendency can vary between individuals. Four subtypes exist: 2A, 2B, 2M, and 2N. These subtypes depend on the presence and behavior of the underlying multimers.",
