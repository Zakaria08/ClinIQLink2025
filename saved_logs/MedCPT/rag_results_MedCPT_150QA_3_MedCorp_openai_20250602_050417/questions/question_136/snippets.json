        "content": "The sensitivity of fluorophores has been an essential aspect of qPCR development. Two main types of fluorophores are used in qPCR: those that bind specifically to a given target sequence and those that lack specificity in binding. One of the most effective and widely used non-specific markers, SYBR Green, after binding to the minor groove of dsDNA, exhibits a 1000-fold increase in fluorescence compared to being free in solution. However, if even more specificity is desired, a sequence-specific oligonucleotide, or hybridization probe, can be added, which binds to the target gene at some point, following the primer (after the 3' end). These hybridization probes contain a reporter molecule at the 5' end and a quencher molecule at the 3' end. The quencher molecule effectively inhibits the reporter from fluorescing while the probe is intact. However, upon contact with DNA polymerase I, the hybridization probe is cleaved, allowing the dye's fluorescence.",

        "content": "Techniques are now available for detecting, measuring, and following almost any desired molecule in a living cell. Fluorescent indicator dyes can be introduced to measure the concentrations of specific ions in individual cells or in different parts of a cell. Virtually any protein of interest can be genetically engineered as a fluorescent fusion protein, and then imaged in living cells by fluorescence microscopy. The dynamic behavior and interactions of many molecules can be followed in living cells by variations on the use of fluorescent protein tags, in some cases at the level of single molecules. Various superresolution techniques can circumvent the diffraction limit and resolve molecules separated by distances as small as 20 nm. Looking at CeLLs anD MoLeCULes in the eLeCtron MiCrosCope",

        "content": "Fluorescence spectroscopy (also known as fluorimetry or spectrofluorometry) is a type of electromagnetic spectroscopy that analyzes fluorescence from a sample. It involves using a beam of light, usually ultraviolet light, that excites the electrons in molecules of certain compounds and causes them to emit light; typically, but not necessarily, visible light. A complementary technique is absorption spectroscopy. In the special case of single molecule fluorescence spectroscopy, intensity fluctuations from the emitted light are measured from either single fluorophores, or pairs of fluorophores. Devices that measure fluorescence are called fluorometers. Theory",
