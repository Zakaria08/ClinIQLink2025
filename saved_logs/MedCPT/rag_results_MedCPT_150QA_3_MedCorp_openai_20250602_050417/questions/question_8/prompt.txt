Document 1 (Title: Pyloric stenosis): Cause Rarely, infantile pyloric stenosis can occur as an autosomal dominant condition. It is uncertain whether it is a congenital anatomic narrowing or a functional hypertrophy of the pyloric sphincter muscle. Pathophysiology The gastric outlet obstruction due to the hypertrophic pylorus impairs emptying of gastric contents into the duodenum. As a consequence, all ingested food and gastric secretions can only exit via vomiting, which can be of a projectile nature. While the exact cause of the hypertrophy remains unknown, one study suggested that neonatal hyperacidity may be involved in the pathogenesis. This physiological explanation for the development of clinical pyloric stenosis at around 4 weeks and its spontaneous long term cure without surgery if treated conservatively, has recently been further reviewed.
Document 2 (Title: Gastroschisis -- Treatment / Management -- Delivery): Infants with gastroschisis have no contraindication to vaginal delivery based on gastroschisis alone. The timing of delivery is based on gestation age (lung maturity), ultrasound findings (fetal growth profile, bowel appearance), and fetal testing results. Care for the infant is usually managed by a group of specialists, including a maternal-fetal medicine specialist, neonatologist, and pediatric surgery, to discuss patient-specific factors before delivery. The mean gestational age for spontaneous delivery in women carrying infants with gastroschisis is the 36th week of gestation. [17] [18] A survey of practice patterns demonstrated forty percent of maternal-fetal medicine specialists deliver infants at 37 weeks, 30 percent deliver at 39 weeks if gastroschisis is stable. The remainder delivers infants before 37 weeks. [13] Overall, many maternal-medicine specialists allow a trial of vaginal delivery. When there is marked liver herniation, a cesarean section should be considered. One factor that some specialis...
Document 3 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): infants born with omphalocele, associated anoma-lies are not usually seen with gastroschisis except for a 10% rate of intestinal atresia. This defect can readily be diagnosed on prenatal US (Fig. 39-32). There is no advantage to perform-ing a cesarean section instead of a vaginal delivery. In a decade long retrospective review, early deliver did not affect the thick-ness of bowel peel, yet patients delivered before 36 weeks had significantly longer length of stay in the hospital and time to enteral feeds. Based upon these findings, it is thought that fetal well-being should be the primary determinant of delivery for gastroschisis.Treatment. All infants born with gastroschisis require urgent surgical treatment. Of equal importance, these infants require vigorous fluid resuscitation in the range of 160 to 190 cc/kg per day to replace significant evaporative fluid losses. In many instances, the intestine can be returned to the abdominal cavity, and a primary surgical closure of the

Question: A 3900-g (8.6-lb) male infant is delivered at 39 weeks' gestation via spontaneous vaginal delivery. Pregnancy and delivery were uncomplicated but a prenatal ultrasound at 20 weeks showed a defect in the pleuroperitoneal membrane. Further evaluation of this patient is most likely to show which of the following findings?
Options:
A. Gastric fundus in the thorax
B. Pancreatic ring around the duodenum
C. Hypertrophy of the gastric pylorus
D. Large bowel in the inguinal canal
