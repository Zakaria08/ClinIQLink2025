Document 1 (Title: IDL, VLDL, chylomicrons and atherosclerosis.): In humans with the lipoprotein lipase deficiency disorder large amounts of chylomicrons and large very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) accumulate in plasma. In spite of this, atherosclerosis does not seem to develop at an accelerated rate, suggesting that these lipoproteins do not promote atherogenesis. In humans with dysbetalipoproteinemia remnant lipoproteins (intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL) plus beta-VLDL) accumulate in plasma and these particles may therefore be the factor causing accelerated atherosclerosis in this disorder. Epidemiological studies in humans suggest that IDL or remnant lipoproteins are predictors of the severity or progression of atherosclerosis. Similar studies in the St. Thomas' Hospital rabbit strain, an animal model with genetically elevated plasma levels of VLDL, IDL and low-density lipoprotein (LDL), showed that IDL or remnant lipoproteins were better predictors of the extent of atherosclerosis than were LDL or VLDL. Studies of lipoprotein/arterial wall interactions have demo...
Document 2 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Missense and nonsense mutations in the apoA-I gene are present in some patients with low plasma levels of HDL-C (usually 15–30 mg/ dL), but are a rare cause of low plasma HDL-C levels. Most individuals with low plasma HDL-C levels due to missense mutations in apoA-I do not appear to have premature CHD. Patients who are heterozygous for an Arg173Cys substitution in apoA-I (so-called apoA-IMilano) have very low plasma levels of HDL-C due to impaired LCAT activation and accelerated clearance of the HDL particles containing the abnormal apoA-I. Despite having very low plasma levels of HDL-C, these individuals do not have an increased risk of premature CHD. A few selected missense mutations in apoA-I and apoA-II promote the formation of amyloid fibrils, which can cause systemic amyloidosis.
Document 3 (Title: Intima-media thickness): Carotid IMT has been used in many epidemiological and clinical studies and these have shown associations with several risk factors, including type 2 diabetes, familial hypercholesterolemia, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), triglycerides, rheumatoid arthritis, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and air pollution. Since the 1990s, some clinical trials of lifestyle and pharmaceutical interventions have also used carotid artery IMT as a surrogate endpoint for evaluating the regression and/or progression of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; however the appropriateness of carotid IMT in this context is uncertain. Although carotid intima-media thickness is strongly associated with atherosclerosis, thickening of the intima-media may not always be due to atherosclerosis. Intima-medial thickening is a complex process, depending on a variety of factors, including blood pressure, local hemodynamics, shear stress and circumferential tensile stress. Variations in IMT between
