Document 1 (Title: Quantification of adipose tissue by MRI: relationship with anthropometric variables.): This study had two objectives: 1) to establish magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a tool for measuring total and regional adipose tissue (AT) distribution in humans and 2) to assess the relationship between selected anthropometric variables and MRI-measured AT. Twenty-seven healthy men varying in age [40.8 +/- 14.5 (SD) yr], body mass index (28.5 +/- 4.8), and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR, 0.96 +/- 0.07) participated in the study. Total AT volume was determined using a linear interpolation of AT areas obtained on consecutive slices (n = 41) taken from head to toe (10-mm thickness, 50-mm centers). The mean change for repeated measures of total AT volume was 2.9% (range 0.9-4.3%). Large interindividual differences were observed for total AT volume (6.9-59.3 liters), subcutaneous AT (6.3-49.8 liters), and visceral AT (0.5-8.5 liters). Visceral AT represented 18.3% of the total AT. The single best predictor of total adiposity was waist circumference (R2 = 0.92). For visceral AT volume, WHR was the strongest anthropom...
Document 2 (Title: Pathophysiology of Obesity -- Issues of Concern -- Obesity and Inflammatory Markers): Obesity is also referred to as chronic-low-grade inflammation or “metabolic inflammation,” which is often the focus in the pathogenesis of several diseases such as coronary artery disease, atherosclerosis, and insulin resistance. [21] [22] Adipose tissue is classified as a complex secretory organ that plays many roles in metabolism. This can modulate energy expenditure, appetite, insulin sensitivity, bone metabolism, reproductive and endocrine functions, inflammation, and immunity and act as a triacylglycerol reservoir. Visceral adiposity correlates well with an increased risk of CVD and diabetes compared to a high body mass index (BMI). [23] [24] However, the biochemical and physiologic reasons for having a better correlation of visceral adiposity are still unclear. One possible explanation is that visceral fat has direct access to the portal circulation compared to subcutaneous white adipose tissue, leading to the substances produced by visceral fat directly affecting the liver.
Document 3 (Title: Adipose tissue): Visceral fat can be caused by excess cortisol levels. At least 10 MET-hours per week of aerobic exercise leads to visceral fat reduction in those without metabolic-related disorders. Resistance training and caloric restriction also reduce visceral fat, although their effect may not be cumulative. Both exercise and hypocaloric diet cause loss of visceral fat, but exercise has a larger effect on visceral fat versus total fat. High-intensity exercise is one way to effectively reduce total abdominal fat. An energy restricted diet combined with exercise will reduce total body fat and the ratio of visceral adipose tissue to subcutaneous adipose tissue, suggesting a preferential mobilization for visceral fat over subcutaneous fat.
