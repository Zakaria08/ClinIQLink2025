However, evidence has shown that the use of epidural analgesia during labor does not have any statistically significant effect on the necessity to perform a cesarean delivery. A 2018 Cochrane review found no increase in the rate of Caesarean delivery when epidural analgesia was employed. However, epidural analgesia does lengthen the second stage of labor by 15 to 30 minutes, which may increase the risk a delivery must be assisted by instruments.",

        "title": "Anesthesia for Labor, Delivery, and Cesarean Section in High-Risk Heart Disease -- Issues of Concern -- Neuraxial Anesthesia",
        "content": "The 2 main methods of neuraxial anesthesia during labor and delivery are epidural anesthesia and combined spinal-epidural anesthesia. Epidural anesthesia generally has a slower onset to peak effectiveness at 15 to 20 minutes and provides greater sacral dermatomal coverage with more uniformity in the sensory blockade. Combined spinal-epidural is preferred for initiating analgesia in cases of advanced labor due to its expedited onset in 2 to 5 minutes. Some practices are performing dural puncture epidural anesthesia in place of combined spinal-epidural. [8] [9] Modern labor analgesia regimens for epidurals typically consist of a combination of a dilute local anesthetic with a low-dose opioid (ie, bupivacaine and fentanyl). The combination of 2 low-dose analgesics reduces the risk of local anesthetic systemic toxicity and a high or total spinal anesthetic (encountered with unintentional intrathecal injection). Hemodynamic effects and placental transfer are minimized via this technique. Dilute local anesthetics help mitigate the risk of motor block, which would necessitate instrumental delivery due to compromised ability to push. Initiation of epidural anesthesia involves a bolus of an amide local anesthetic (ie, bupivacaine or ropivacaine) with a lipid-soluble opioid (ie, fentanyl or hydromorphone). After an initial bolus, maintenance of epidural anesthesia can be obtained through various combinations of techniques, including continuous infusion, intermittent bolus, or patient-controlled bolus. An opioid-only intrathecal dose, such as 25 micrograms of fentanyl, provides excellent analgesia for the first and second stages of labor while maintaining hemodynamic stability. Still, it is associated with a high incidence of pruritis. [10] [8]",

        "content": "We studied primigravid women in spontaneous labor at term and given epidural analgesia. Two hundred such women giving birth in 1983 were compared with similar groups who gave birth in 1985 and 1987 after the introduction of 'delayed pushing' into our labor ward protocol. Four hundred controls were obtained in 1983 and 1985 by selecting from the labor ward register the next normal primigravid woman in spontaneous labor without epidural analgesia. The assisted delivery rate was significantly higher in all three epidural groups than in the controls (p less than 0.001). Among epidural labors, there was no significant difference between 1983 and 1987 in the incidence of rotational or non-rotational forceps, or of cesarean section. In each epidural group, women who waited more than 60 min were less likely to experience a normal spontaneous delivery than were those who did not (p less than 0.001 in 1983; p = 0.006 in 1985 p = 0.035 in 1987). We conclude that to delay pushing beyond 60 min confers no benefit regarding mode of delivery.",
