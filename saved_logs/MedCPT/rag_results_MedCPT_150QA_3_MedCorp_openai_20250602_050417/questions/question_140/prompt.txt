Document 1 (Title: A case of prenatal diagnosis of hemophilia A.): Classic hemophilia, (hemophilia A), is an X-linked hereditary bleeding disorder affecting half of the male offspring of female carriers. Prenatal diagnosis offers an option, namely to restrict abortions to hemophilic fetuses only, and thus retain the chance of bearing normal sons. Recently, the authors have made a prenatal diagnosis of hemophilia A in an obligate carrier with a male fetus at 24 weeks of gestation by pure fetal sampling and accurate factor VIII coagulant assay, which was repeatedly less than 1% at 28 weeks of gestation.
Document 2 (Title: Pediatrics_Nelson): Etiology. Hemophilia A (factor 8 deficiency) occurs in 1 in 5000 males. Hemophilia B (factor 9 deficiency) occurs in approximately 1 in 25,000. Clinically the two disorders are indistinguishable other than by their therapy (Table 151-3).The lack of factor 8 or factor 9 delays the generation of thrombin, which is crucial to forming a normal, functional fibrin clot and solidifying the platelet plug that has formed in areas of vascular injury. The severity of the disorder is determined by the degree of clotting factor deficiency.

Document 3 (Title: Thrombophilia): In thrombophilia, the balance between "procoagulant" and "anticoagulant" activity is disturbed. The severity of the imbalance determines the likelihood that someone develops thrombosis. Even small perturbances of proteins, such as the reduction of antithrombin to only 70–80% of the normal level, can increase the thrombosis risk; this is in contrast with hemophilia, which only arises if levels of coagulation factors are markedly decreased. In addition to its effects on thrombosis, hypercoagulable states may accelerate the development of atherosclerosis, the arterial disease that underlies myocardial infarction and other forms of cardiovascular disease.
