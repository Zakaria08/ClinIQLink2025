Document 1 (Title: Immediate breast reconstruction at the time of mastectomy for breast cancer.): Immediate breast reconstruction avoids or lessens the psychosocial trauma associated with a disfiguring mastectomy. The complications seen in this small patient sample are not in excess of those seen in patients undergoing delayed reconstruction. Fifteen immediate breast reconstructions were performed at the time of mastectomy for cancer. Flap or implant reconstruction alone was determined on an individual basis. No delays in the initiation of adjuvant chemotherapy or hormone therapy were caused by the reconstructions. There were no instances of total flap loss or wound infection. One implant was lost due to exposure. Other complications were similar to those associated with modified radical mastectomy alone. These preliminary results suggest that immediate breast reconstruction at the time of mastectomy may be offered with safety to newly diagnosed breast cancer patients.
Document 2 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): need to adjuvant radiation therapy, decision-making regarding immediate reconstruction is a challenge. Breast reconstructions by all techniques are adversely affected by radiation therapy, and many surgeons feel reconstruction should be delayed until at least 6 months after treatment.Once the patient chooses to have immediate reconstruction, she must select a reconstructive technique. In patients selected for breast conservation, oncoplastic tissue rearrangement can be performed to minimize adverse effects of lumpectomy on breast appearance. For patients electing total mastectomy there are essentially three options: (a) tissue expansion followed by breast implant placement, (b) combined tissue flaps with breast implants, and (c) autologous tissue flaps only. After examining the patient, the surgeon then should describe those methods for which the patient is a satisfactory candidate. The patient should then be encouraged to choose based on her goals and an under-standing of the
Document 3 (Title: Breast Reconstruction -- Indications): Immediate repair refers to a reconstruction performed during the same surgical session as the cancer resection. While this prolongs the time under anesthesia, the advantage of using a more natural skin envelope for reconstructive options is considerable. The skin envelope created during skin/nipple-sparing mastectomy can leave the patient with a more natural-appearing breast postoperatively. Oncologic considerations such as stage and BRCA mutation status are key in determining if this approach is reasonable. Immediate reconstruction is affected by the need for adjuvant therapy, specifically radiation therapy. The risk of wound breakdown and other complications is significantly increased when a foreign body, such as a breast implant, is within the radiated field. [7] Patients requiring adjuvant radiation are often best served with autologous tissue reconstruction, whether pedicled or free flap in nature. [8]
