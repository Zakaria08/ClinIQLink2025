        "content": "The stationary phase is a crucial component of chromatography that interacts with analytes as they pass through, leading to separation. Solid, liquid, or gas can be held over a supporting medium. The stationary phase interacts with various mixture components based on the polarity, affinity, size, and charge. Thus, different analytes have varying degrees of interaction with the stationary phase, leading to differential retention times and elution profiles. [1] Different types of chromatography use combinations of stationary and mobile phases to achieve separation. Refer to image 1 for the classification of chromatography.",

        "content": "Stationary phases In the 1970s, most liquid chromatography was performed using a solid support stationary phase (also called a column) containing unmodified silica or alumina resins. This type of technique is now referred to as normal-phase chromatography. Since the stationary phase is hydrophilic in this technique, molecules with hydrophilic properties contained within the mobile phase will have a high affinity for the stationary phase, and therefore will adsorb to the column packing. Hydrophobic molecules experience less of an affinity for the column packing, and will pass through to be eluted and detected first. Elution of the hydrophilic molecules adsorbed to the column packing requires the use of more hydrophilic or more polar solvents in the mobile phase to shift the distribution of the particles in the stationary phase towards that of the mobile phase.",

        "content": "Fig. 16.1 illustrates action potentials found in different cardiac cells. Two main types of action potentials occur in the heart and are depicted. One type, the fast response, occurs in normal atrial and ventricular myocytes and in the specialized conducting fibers (Purkinje fibers of the heart) and is divided into five phases. The rapid upstroke of the action potential is designated phase 0. The upstroke is followed by a brief period of partial, early repolarization (phase 1) and then by a plateau (phase 2) that persists for approximately 0.1 to 0.2 second. The membrane then repolarizes (phase 3) until the resting state of polarization (phase 4) is again attained. Final repolarization (phase 3) develops more slowly than depolarization (phase 0). The other type of action potential, the slow response, occurs in the sinoatrial (SA) node, which is the natural pacemaker region of the heart, and in the atrioventricular (AV) node, which is the specialized tissue that conducts the cardiac",
