        "title": "Why are converting enzyme inhibitors vasodilators?",
        "content": "1. The primary action of the converting enzyme inhibitors to prevent the formation of angiotensin II can explain a decrease in peripheral vascular resistance in patients with elevated, but not in those with normal or reduced plasma renin levels. 2. The inhibition of the breakdown of bradykinin will potentiate the vasodilator properties of the endogenously produced peptide. These include direct relaxation of certain vascular smooth muscle, production of vasodilator prostanoids and release of endothelium-derived relaxing factor(s). The greater release of the latter in the kidney could exert a negative feedback on the release of renin. 3. In addition, converting enzyme inhibitors may directly (by a prejunctional effect) and indirectly (by curtailing the production of angiotensin II) reduce the release of noradrenaline in the blood vessel wall. 4. Converting enzyme inhibitors may also directly reduce the responsiveness of vascular smooth muscle to vasoconstrictor stimuli (e.g. alpha-adrenoceptor activation). 5. The different effects of these therapeutic agents may concur to induce peripheral vasodilatation.",

        "content": "of other peptides, including and thereby inactivating the vasodilator bradykinin. Acting primarily through angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptors on cell membranes, angiotensin II is a potent pressor substance, the primary tropic factor for the secretion of aldosterone by the adrenal zona glomerulosa, and a potent mitogen that stimulates vascular smooth muscle cell and myocyte growth. Independent of its hemodynamic effects, angiotensin II may play a role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis through a direct cellular action on the vessel wall. The angiotensin II type 2 (AT2) receptor has the opposite functional effects of the AT1 receptor. The AT2 receptor induces vasodilation, sodium excretion, and inhibition of cell growth and matrix formation. Experimental evidence suggests that the AT2 receptor improves vascular remodeling by stimulating smooth muscle cell apoptosis and contributes to the regulation of glomerular filtration rate. AT1 receptor blockade induces an increase in AT2",

It is an important effector controlling blood pressure and volume in the cardiovascular system. Angiotensin II receptor antagonists are drugs indicated for hypertension, diabetic nephropathy and congestive heart failure. Function The AT1 receptor mediates the major cardiovascular effects of angiotensin II. Effects include vasoconstriction, aldosterone synthesis and secretion, increased vasopressin secretion, cardiac hypertrophy, augmentation of peripheral noradrenergic activity, vascular smooth muscle cells proliferation, decreased renal blood flow, renal renin inhibition, renal tubular sodium reuptake, modulation of central sympathetic nervous system activity, cardiac contractility, central osmocontrol and extracellular matrix formation.
