Age, race, and geography affect the incidence of NS. Certain HLA types (HLA-DR7, HLA-B8, and HLA-B12) are associated with an increased incidence of NS. Increased glomerular permeability is due to alterations in the normal glomerular cellular and basement membrane barrier that restrict filtration of serum proteins.

        "content": "Decreased albumin levels may be an incidental finding on protein electrophoresis; however, protein electrophoresis provides a semi-quantitative albumin value. The main value of protein electrophoresis in a patient with low serum albumin is with the differential diagnosis of hypoalbuminemia. In the presence of acute inflammation, hypoalbuminemia will be present with an increase in alpha-1 and 2 globulins and normal gamma globulins. In chronic inflammation, the protein electrophoresis pattern will show hypoalbuminemia with a polyclonal increase in gamma globulins.",
