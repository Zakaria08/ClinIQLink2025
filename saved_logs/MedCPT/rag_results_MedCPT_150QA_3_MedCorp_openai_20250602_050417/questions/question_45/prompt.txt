Document 1 (Title: Thyroid carcinoma. A report of 206 cases from an area with endemic goitre.): A retrospective analysis of 206 cases of thyroid carcinoma treated at a single surgical service in a region with endemic goitre is presented. In contrast to the marked female preponderance in surgically treated benign thyroid disorders, the frequency of thyroid carcinoma was almost equal in the two sexes (males/females = 100/106). The duration of symptoms was, as a rule, short and there was a predominance of advanced lesions (T3N3M1) even among the well-differentiated tumours. Papillary carcinoma was the most common histologic type (45%) but its proportion was considerably lower than usually reported from non-endemic regions. The average TSH level was significantly elevated in the carcinoma group and associated adenomatous changes were found in 40/100 cases which might suggest an etiologic role of increased TSH stimulation. Since most thyroid carcinomas had a very malignant clinical behaviour, surgical treatment aimed at near-total thyroidectomy which was performed in 62% of the cases. During a follow-up of u...
Document 2 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): without immediate surgery) can be a viable and safe first line of treatment for these very-low-risk tumors without extra-thyroidal extension or lymph node metastases.41 Tumors that progress during monitoring are treated by surgery. If surgery is chosen as initial treatment for these patients, a thyroid lobec-tomy is considered sufficient.When PTC is diagnosed by FNAB, the definitive operation can be done without confirming the diagnosis by frozen section during the operation. Patients with a nodule that is suspicious for papillary cancer should be treated by thyroid lobectomy, isthmu-sectomy, and removal of any pyramidal lobe or adjacent lymph nodes. If intraoperative frozen-section examination of a lymph node or primary tumor confirms carcinoma, completion total or near-total thyroidectomy is performed. If a definitive diagnosis cannot be made or the surgeon is concerned about the viability of the parathyroid glands or the status of the RLN, the opera-tion is terminated. When final
Document 3 (Title: First_Aid_Step1): Thyroid cancer Typically diagnosed with fine needle aspiration; treated with thyroidectomy. Complications of surgery include hypocalcemia (due to removal of parathyroid glands), transection of recurrent laryngeal nerve during ligation of inferior thyroid artery (leads to dysphagia and dysphonia [hoarseness]), and injury to the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve during ligation of superior thyroid vascular pedicle (may lead to loss of tenor usually noticeable in professional voice users). Papillary carcinoma Most common, excellent prognosis. Empty-appearing nuclei with central clearing (“Orphan Annie” eyes) A , psamMoma bodies, nuclear grooves (Papi and Moma adopted OrphanAnnie).  risk with RET/PTC rearrangements and BRAF mutations, childhood irradiation. Papillary carcinoma: most Prevalent, Palpable lymph nodes. Good prognosis.

Question: A 38-year-old woman undergoes hemithyroidectomy for treatment of localized, well-differentiated papillary thyroid carcinoma. The lesion is removed with clear margins. However, during the surgery, a structure lying directly adjacent to the superior thyroid artery at the upper pole of the thyroid lobe is damaged. This patient is most likely to experience which of the following symptoms?
Options:
A. Voice pitch limitation
B. Ineffective cough
C. Weakness of shoulder shrug
D. Shortness of breath
