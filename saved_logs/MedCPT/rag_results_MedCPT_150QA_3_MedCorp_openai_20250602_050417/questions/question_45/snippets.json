        "title": "Thyroid carcinoma. A report of 206 cases from an area with endemic goitre.",
        "content": "A retrospective analysis of 206 cases of thyroid carcinoma treated at a single surgical service in a region with endemic goitre is presented. In contrast to the marked female preponderance in surgically treated benign thyroid disorders, the frequency of thyroid carcinoma was almost equal in the two sexes (males/females = 100/106). The duration of symptoms was, as a rule, short and there was a predominance of advanced lesions (T3N3M1) even among the well-differentiated tumours. Papillary carcinoma was the most common histologic type (45%) but its proportion was considerably lower than usually reported from non-endemic regions. The average TSH level was significantly elevated in the carcinoma group and associated adenomatous changes were found in 40/100 cases which might suggest an etiologic role of increased TSH stimulation. Since most thyroid carcinomas had a very malignant clinical behaviour, surgical treatment aimed at near-total thyroidectomy which was performed in 62% of the cases. During a follow-up of up to eleven years recurrence in the remaining contralateral lobe occurred in 23% of patients with hemithyroidectomy and loco-regional recurrence was seen in 29% of patients with near-total thyroidectomy. Mortality was high in all histologic types, further underlining the aggressive biologic behaviour of thyroid cancers in an endemic area.",
