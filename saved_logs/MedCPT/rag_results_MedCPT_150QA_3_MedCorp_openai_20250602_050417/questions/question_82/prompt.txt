Document 1 (Title: Clinical features and outcome in 68 cases of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage without aneurysm repair--a community hospital study.): The authors studied the clinical features and outcome at 6 months in 191 patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) from ruptured aneurysms. Aneurysm repair (AR) was undertaken in 123 cases (64.4%). In the non-AR group (n = 68), 48.5% of the patients were 70 years of age or older, compared with 12.2% in the AR group. The duration from onset to admission was less than 3 hours in 48 non-AR cases (70.6%) and in 42 AR cases (34.1%). Among non-AR patients, 63.2% were Hunt and Hess grade IV or V, whereas the figure for AR patients was only 14.7%. By 6 months after SAH, 94.1% of non-AR patients had died, and the remainder were vegetative or severely disabled. In contrast, only 15.4% in the AR group died, and over 50% showed good recovery. The large majority of non-AR patients were treated conservatively because they were judged to be poor surgical risks and, among these patients, nearly one half were elderly. In the 10 elderly patients considered good surgical candidates, vasospasm was the most common reason (70%) ...
Document 2 (Title: Subarachnoid Hemorrhage -- Epidemiology): Most aSAH occur between 40 and 60 years of age, and young children and older adults can be affected. [22] The mean age of aneurysmal rupture ranges from 50-55 years. [23] It is more prevalent in the Blacks and Hispanic populations than the white Americans. [22] There is a slightly higher incidence of aneurysmal SAH in females, which may be related to their hormonal status. [23] Patients with a history of smoking and previously ruptured intracerebral aneurysm are highly associated with new subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Document 3 (Title: Neurology_Adams): 42 of 44 patients were women and most were older than 50 years of age. All of the patients reported by So and coworkers were women, ranging in age from 41 to 70 years. Cerebral ischemia may be associated with the process but the rate of this complication has not been established; our impression is that it is low. In the study by Corrin and colleagues, among 79 untreated asymptomatic patients followed for an average of 5 years, 3 had a cerebral infarct 4 to 18 years after the initial diagnosis. Also, between 7 and 20 percent of affected individuals are found to have intracranial saccular aneurysms (rarely a giant aneurysm), which may be sources of subarachnoid hemorrhage, and up to 12 percent develop arterial dissections, as described below.
