Document 1 (Title: Leukemoid reaction): Diagnosis Conventionally, a leukocytosis exceeding 50,000 WBC/mm3 with a significant increase in early neutrophil precursors is referred to as a leukemoid reaction. The peripheral blood smear may show myelocytes, metamyelocytes, promyelocytes, and rarely myeloblasts; however, there is a mixture of early mature neutrophil precursors, in contrast to the immature forms typically seen in acute leukemia. Serum leukocyte alkaline phosphatase is normal or elevated in leukemoid reaction, but is depressed in chronic myelogenous leukemia. The bone marrow in a leukemoid reaction, if examined, may be hypercellular but is otherwise typically unremarkable.
Document 2 (Title: Myeloproliferative Neoplasms -- Pathophysiology): MPL proto-oncogene mutation :  The MPL gene codes the thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor which regulates megakaryopoiesis through a JAK-STAT pathway. The most common somatic MPL mutations are MPL W515L and MPL W515K which cause spontaneous activation of the JAK-STAT pathway, resulting in abnormal hematopoietic cell proliferation. [8] These mutations are found in up to 6% of ET and up to 10% of PMF as per literature. [4] [9] Furthermore, this mutation will help categorize patients diagnosed with negative JAK2 V617F mutation and Philadelphia chromosome MPN. MPL mutations increase the risk of thrombotic complications as compared to JAK2 V617F mutation patients and are associated with low hemoglobin, low bone marrow (BM) cellularity, high platelets, and high serum erythropoietin levels.

Document 3 (Title: Prognostic factors in chronic granulocytic leukemia. A study of 798 cases.): Between 1959 and 1973 were analyzed the records of 798 patients with chronic myelocytic leukemia. Mean survival (MS) for the entire group is 42 months. 342 patients have been followed closely during and after development of blastic transformation. Presence of following symptoms at the time of diagnosis: asthenia, weight loss, bone pain, fever, sweats and digestive disorders is of poor prognosis significance (MS: 36 months, no sign: MS 75 months) (P less than 0.001). Spleen size is also a prognostic factor. MS are respectively 70, 52 and 35 months if initial splenomegaly is moderate (less than 3 cm), marked (less than 6 cm) or tumoral (greater than or equal to 6 cm). Thrombocytopenia (less than 15,000/mm3 or thrombocythemia (greater than 1 million/mm3) have a poor prognosis with median survival 22 months and 28 months. If peripheral blast cells (hemocytoblasts + myeloblasts) exceed 5%, the prognosis is worse; beyond 10% MS is 26 months. In contrast certain factors have better prognosis: hemoglobin greater than...

Question: A 52-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of generalized fatigue, low-grade fever, and a 10-kg (22-lb) weight loss. Physical examination shows generalized pallor and splenomegaly. Her hemoglobin concentration is 7.5 g/dL and leukocyte count is 41,800/mm3. Leukocyte alkaline phosphatase activity is low. Peripheral blood smear shows basophilia with myelocytes and metamyelocytes. Bone marrow biopsy shows cellular hyperplasia with proliferation of immature granulocytic cells. Which of the following mechanisms is most likely responsible for this patient's condition?
Options:
A. Cytokine-independent activation of the JAK-STAT pathway
B. Loss of function of the APC gene
C. Altered expression of the retinoic acid receptor gene
D. Unregulated expression of the ABL1 gene
