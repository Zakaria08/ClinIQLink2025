        "title": "Relationship between osmolality and osmolarity.",
        "content": "Since the compendia require the osmolarity of certain parenterals to be labeled and since experimentally only the osmolality can be measured, it is necessary to obtain the relationship between these two quantities. This relationship was determined by considering fundamental physical-chemical definitions. The osmolality of a solution was found to be simply related to the osmotic coefficient. The conversion to osmolarity requires the use of the partial molal volume(s) of the solute(s). A single conversion factor is required for a particular solute system; i.e., the conversion factor is independent of the solution concentration.",

        "content": "Equation 1.8 Osmolarity = concentration × number of dissociable particles mOsm/L = mmol/L × number of particles The terms osmolarity and osmolality are frequently confused and incorrectly interchanged. Osmolarity refers to the osmotic pressure generated by the dissolved solute molecules in 1 L of solvent, whereas osmolality is the number of molecules dissolved in 1 kg of solvent. For a dilute solution, the difference between osmolarity and osmolality is cNaCl does not completely dissociate in water. The value for n is 1.88 rather than 2. However, for simplicity, the value of 2 is most often used.",

        "content": "Osmolality is a colligative property of solutions that depends on the number of dissolved particles in the solution. [1] The term osmolality expresses concentrations relative to the mass of the solvent, whereas the term osmolarity expresses concentrations per volume of solution. Osmolality is thermodynamically accurate because solution concentrations expressed on a weight basis are temperature-independent, whereas those based on volume vary with temperature. [2] Although the term osmolarity is used in the medical literature, osmolality is usually measured.",
