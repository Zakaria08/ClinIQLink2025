Document 1 (Title: Past Present and Future of Simulation in Internal Medicine -- Clinical Clerkships): As internal medicine residents rotate through their clinical clerkships, simulation can be used to prepare them for the experience, assess if objectives of the rotation are met, and remediate if they are not. As an example, at the Mayo Clinic Internal Medicine Program in Florida, residents start their critical care rotation with a day of “boot camp” in the simulation center. During this time, they receive instruction in sterile technique for gowning and gloving, placement of central lines under ultrasound guidance, and practice ventilation and intubation. Further simulated practice occurs during the emergency medicine rotation, which includes learning the management of medical emergencies such as hyperkalemia, pneumothorax, and gastrointestinal bleed and procedural skills such as ultrasound (e.g., FAST exam), abscess drainage and placing chest tubes. Dedicated practice like this enhances patient safety. [5] The simulation center is also used to assess competency periodically during the three years of residenc...
Document 2 (Title: Medical school in the United States): The third and fourth years consist of clinical rotations, sometimes called clerkships, where students see patients in hospitals and clinics. These rotations are usually at teaching hospitals but are occasionally at community hospitals or with private physicians. Mandatory rotations in third year are often obstetrics and gynecology, pediatrics, psychiatry, family medicine, internal medicine, and surgery. During the third year, medical students take Step 2/Level 2 of the medical licensing boards. Fourth year rotations typically allow students to choose several electives and finish required rotations. It is also used as a period of auditioning for residency programs.
Document 3 (Title: Influence of clerkship structure and timing on individual student performance.): Student oral and written surgical clerkship performances may be related to the clerkship structure and the time of year the students rotate through the clerkship. The influence of calendar block, hospital site (university hospital, affiliated private tertiary-care hospital, and rural preceptor experience), and the mix of general surgical versus subspeciality rotations on oral and written student surgery clerkship scores was analyzed. Multivariate analysis of variance revealed significant differences in score for calendar block (p = 0.02) only; this difference resided in the written examination. The various combinations of rotations were not different from one another in terms of measured outcome.
