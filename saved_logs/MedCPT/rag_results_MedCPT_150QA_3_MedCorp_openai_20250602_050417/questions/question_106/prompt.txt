With your own knowledge and the help of the following document:

Document 1 (Title: Jet fuel): from acute, subchronic, or chronic exposure of humans or animals to kerosene-based hydrocarbon fuels, or the constituent chemicals of these fuels, or to fuel combustion products. The effects studied include: cancer, skin conditions, respiratory disorders, immune and hematological disorders, neurological effects, visual and hearing disorders, renal and hepatic diseases, cardiovascular conditions, gastrointestinal disorders, genotoxic and metabolic effects.
Document 2 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): Three stages of ethylene glycol overdose occur. Within the first few hours after ingestion, there is transient excitation followed by CNS depression. After a delay of 4–12 hours, severe metabolic acidosis develops from accumulation of acid metabolites and lactate. Finally, deposition of oxalate crystals in renal tubules occurs, followed by delayed renal insufficiency. The key to the diagnosis of ethylene glycol poisoning is recognition of anion gap acidosis, osmolar gap, and oxalate crystals in the urine in a patient without visual symptoms.
Document 3 (Title: Ethylene Glycol Toxicity -- Epidemiology): Individuals at risk include toddlers and young children exploring their environment, patients with alcohol use disorder, and individuals wanting to end their lives. [1] According to the Annual Report of the American Association of Poison Control Centers' National Poison Data System, the number of case mentions of ethylene glycol in 2016 was 6,374. Most of these cases were intentional in adults older than 20. [4] Children younger than 12 comprised 686 of the 6374 cases, with 13 unknown child-age cases. [4]

Question: Among the following symptoms, which one(s) is (are) commonly observed in acute ethylene glycol poisoning?
Options:
1. Renal failure
2. Neurological disorders
3. Acid-base disorders
4. Cardiovascular disorders
5. Hearing disorders
