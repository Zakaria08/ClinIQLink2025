Document 1 (Title: Ethylenediaminetetraacetic Acid (EDTA) -- Mechanism of Action): Chelation agents function by forming bonds with various metal ions, including calcium, zinc, lead, etc. After these bonds are formed, a soluble chelate-metal complex is created that can be excreted from the body. In a similar method, EDTA has a complex structure that allows it to bind various metals. The molecular composition of EDTA consists of multiple oxygen molecules, which function to donate electrons and form coordination complexes with metal ions. When calcium disodium edetate binds to metals, the calcium is displaced from the structure. The bonds formed with the metals are extremely strong and prevent further toxic effects from occurring before excretion out of the body. [7]
Document 2 (Title: Citric acid): Acid salts of citric acid can be prepared by careful adjustment of the pH before crystallizing the compound. See, for example, sodium citrate. The citrate ion forms complexes with metallic cations. The stability constants for the formation of these complexes are quite large because of the chelate effect. Consequently, it forms complexes even with alkali metal cations. However, when a chelate complex is formed using all three carboxylate groups, the chelate rings have 7 and 8 members, which are generally less stable thermodynamically than smaller chelate rings. In consequence, the hydroxyl group can be deprotonated, forming part of a more stable 5-membered ring, as in ammonium ferric citrate, ·2. Citric acid can be esterified at one or more of its three carboxylic acid groups to form any of a variety of mono-, di-, tri-, and mixed esters. Biochemistry Citric acid cycle
Document 3 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Chelating agents can bind many radioactive materials, after which the complexes are excreted from the body. In this regard, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA)—as either Ca-DTPA or Zn-DTPA—is superior to ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA); DTPA has been approved by the FDA to treat internal contamination with plutonium, americium, and curium, but it also chelates berkelium, californium, and any other material with an atomic number >92. Ca-DTPA is more effective than Zn-DTPA during the first 24 h after internal contamination, and the two drugs are equally effective after the initial 24 h. If both drugs are available, Ca-DTPA should be given as the first dose. If additional treatment is needed, treatment should be switched to Zn-DTPA. The dose is 1 g of Ca-DTPA or Zn-DTPA, dissolved in 250 mL of normal saline or 5% glucose and given intravenously over 1 h daily. The duration of chelation treatment depends on the amount of internal contamination and the individual response to
