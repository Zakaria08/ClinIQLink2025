Document 1 (Title: Passive smoking): Risk to children Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). In his 2006 report, the US Surgeon General concludes: "The evidence is sufficient to infer a causal relationship between exposure to secondhand smoke and sudden infant death syndrome." Secondhand smoking has been estimated to be associated with 430 SIDS deaths in the United States annually. Asthma. Secondhand smoke exposure is also associated with an almost doubled risk of hospitalization for asthma exacerbation among children with asthma. Lung infections, also including more severe illness with bronchiolitis and bronchitis, and worse outcome, as well as increased risk of developing tuberculosis if exposed to a carrier. In the United States, it is estimated that secondhand smoke has been associated with between 150,000 and 300,000 lower respiratory tract infections in infants and children under 18 months of age, resulting in between 7,500 and 15,000 hospitalizations each year.
Document 2 (Title: Nicotine Addiction and Smoking: Health Effects and Interventions (Nursing) -- Risk Factors): Secondhand smoke from cigarettes and cigars also causes heart disease and lung cancer in adults and a number of health problems in infants and children, including: Asthma Respiratory infections and reactive airway Ear infections Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)
Document 3 (Title: Epidemiology Morbidity And Mortality -- Clinical Significance): These subcategories provide great insight into the health of the population and highlight any group that may be disproportionately affected. For example, a review of infant mortality in the United States from 1950 to 2010 showed that while infant mortality has substantially decreased in the past four decades, the disparity between African Americans and Whites has progressively increased, further worsened by education and income inequities. [16] Other disparities uncovered include the indirect relationship between socioeconomic status and cancer mortalities, the prevalence of asthma morbidities in inner-city areas, and the unethical targeting of smoking advertisements in low-income schools. [17] [18] [19] It is by using these types of information that stakeholders of a community or population can make better decisions on the type, target, order, and scope of an intervention to pursue, ultimately allowing for communities to properly allocate their time, money, and other resources toward the most impactful and c...
