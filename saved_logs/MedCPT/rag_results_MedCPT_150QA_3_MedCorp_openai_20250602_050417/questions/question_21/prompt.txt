Document 1 (Title: Cauda equina syndrome): Other risk factors include obesity and being female. Diagnosis Diagnosis is first suspected clinically based on history and physical exam and usually confirmed by an MRI scan or CT scan, depending on availability. Bladder scanning and loss of catheter sensation can also be used to evaluate bladder dysfunction in suspected cases of cauda equina syndrome and can aid diagnosis before MRI scanning. Early surgery in acute onset of severe cases has been reported to be important. Prevention Early diagnosis of cauda equina syndrome can allow for preventive treatment. Signs that allow early diagnosis include changes in bowel and bladder function and loss of feeling in groin. Changes in sensation can start as pins and needles leading to numbness. Changes in bladder function may be changes to stream or inability to fully empty the bladder. If a person progresses to full retention intervention is less likely to be successful.
Document 2 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): SAcrAl corD/conuS meDullAriS The conus medullaris is the tapered caudal termination of the spinal cord, comprising the sacral and single coccygeal segments. The distinctive conus syndrome consists of bilateral saddle anesthesia (S3-S5), prominent bladder and bowel dysfunction (urinary retention and incontinence with lax anal tone), and impotence. The bulbocavernosus (S2-S4) and anal (S4-S5) reflexes are absent (Chap. 437). Muscle strength is largely preserved. By contrast, lesions of the cauda equina, the nerve roots derived from the lower cord, are characterized by low back and radicular pain, asymmetric leg weakness and sensory loss, variable areflexia in the lower extremities, and relative sparing of bowel and bladder function. Mass lesions in the lower spinal Diseases of the Spinal Cord canal often produce a mixed clinical picture with elements of both cauda equina and conus medullaris syndromes. Cauda equina syndromes are also discussed in Chap. 22.
Document 3 (Title: Male Urinary Retention: Acute and Chronic -- Treatment / Management -- Cauda equina syndrome): The syndrome is caused by damage or compression of the spinal nerve roots from L1 to L5, especially L3 to L5. The most common cause (45%) is a herniated intervertebral disc. Other etiologies include spinal hematomas, diskitis, primary or metastatic spinal neoplasms, epidural abscess, trauma, aortic obstruction, and spinal stenosis. [65] The incidence is very low at an estimated 1:30,000 to 1:100,000 population. [66] Typical symptoms include back pain, sciatica, neuropathy or weakness of the lower extremities, saddle anesthesia, urinary retention, and bowel dysfunction. The syndrome should be suspected whenever urinary retention is associated with unexplained bowel dysfunction. The risk increases with decreased rectal tone, saddle anesthesia, or back pain. MRI makes the diagnosis. Immediate surgical correction can help minimize long-term complications, but this requires early clinical suspicion and proper imaging. Unfortunately, almost half of these patients (47.7%) develop long-term urinary retention, usually...

Question: A 69-year-old male presents to the emergency room with back pain. He has a history of personality disorder and metastatic prostate cancer and was not a candidate for surgical resection. He began chemotherapy but discontinued due to unremitting nausea. He denies any bowel or bladder incontinence. He has never had pain like this before and is demanding morphine. The nurse administers IV morphine and he feels more comfortable. Vital signs are stable. On physical examination you note tenderness to palpation along the lower spine, weakness in the bilateral lower extremities, left greater than right. Neurological examination is also notable for hyporeflexia in the knee and ankle jerks bilaterally. You conduct a rectal examination, which reveals saddle anesthesia. Regarding this patient, what is the most likely diagnosis and the appropriate next step in management?
Options:
A. The most likely diagnosis is cauda equina syndrome and steroids should be started prior to MRI
B. The most likely diagnosis is cauda equina syndrome and steroids should be started after to MRI
C. The most likely diagnosis is cauda equina syndrome and the patient should be rushed to radiation
D. The most likely diagnosis is conus medullaris syndrome and steroids should be started prior to MRI
