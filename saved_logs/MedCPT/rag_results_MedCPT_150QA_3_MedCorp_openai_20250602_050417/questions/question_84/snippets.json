        "title": "[Pathomorphologic study on early hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)--a study of cell density in well-differentiated HCC of the early stage].",
        "content": "In order to clarify the histologic characteristics of well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a comparative morphometric study on cell density was performed in 15 HCCs smaller than 2 cm in diameter, 6 HCCs with marked fatty and/or clear cell change, 7 hyperplastic nodules, 5 hyperplastic nodules containing foci of HCC, and non-cancerous areas of the livers bearing small HCC. In well-differentiated HCC, marked increase of cell density accompanying by decrease of cell size and increase of nuclear cytoplasm ratio were prominent, and the cell density was approximately two times larger than that of the non-cancerous area in most cases. In HCCs with marked fatty and/or clear cell change, as an increase of cell density was not evident because of swelling of the cytoplasm due to fat and/or glycogen accumulation, it should be careful to differentiate them from non-cancerous nodular lesions including hyperplastic nodule with marked fatty change. Hyperplastic nodules could be divided into two groups; those with marked increase of cell density, and those without increase of cell density. In the former group, 5 of the 7 nodules contained cancerous foci.",

        "content": "secondary to reduced metabolic activity within the tumor.Although the role of PET/CT in the clinical management of liver metastases has been well-established, its utility in the diagnostic workup of primary liver tumors is still debated. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), FDG uptake correlates with the degree of differentiation—high-grade HCC lesions have increased FDG uptake compared to low-grade HCCs. As a result, the overall sensitivity of FDG-PET/CT in the detection of HCCs is reported to be only 50% to 65%, rendering this modality insufficient when used alone in the diagnosis of primary HCCs. For this reason, dual-tracer PET has been introduced to improve sensitivity in detecting all HCC. This modality combines the use of FDG, which accumulates in poorly differentiated tumors, with 11C-acetate, a tracer preferentially accumulated by well-differentiated HCC lesions. Although the clinical benefits of dual-tracer PET/CT have yet to be fully established, this com-bined modality has",

If the cancer cannot be completely removed, the disease is usually deadly within 3 to 6 months. This is partially due to late presentation with tumors, but also the lack of medical expertise and facilities in the regions with high HCC prevalence. However, survival can vary, and occasionally people survive much longer than 6 months.
