        "content": "A child with dihydropteridine reductase (DHPR) deficiency developed signs of dopamine insufficiency after being given trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX). She recovered function after the antibiotic was stopped, which suggests that it adversely influenced dopamine metabolism in the CNS. The authors speculate that TMP, a dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor, was the major cause of the patient's deterioration, and suggest that it and other dihydrofolate inhibitors, notably methotrexate, are contra-indicated for patients with DHPR deficiency.",

        "content": "Mechanism of Action Trimethoprim, a trimethoxybenzylpyrimidine, selectively inhibits bacterial dihydrofolic acid reductase, which converts dihydrofolic acid to tetrahydrofolic acid, a step leading to the synthesis of purines and ultimately to DNA (Figure 46–2). Trimethoprim is a much less efficient inhibitor of mammalian dihydrofolic acid reductase. The combination of trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole is often bactericidal, compared with the bacteriostatic activity of a sulfonamide alone.",
