Onset of action: 30\u201360 seconds Peak effect: 1 minute Duration: 3\u20135 minutes; terminated by redistribution Distribution: Vd: 2\u20134.5 L/kg Protein binding: 76% Metabolism: Hepatic and plasma esterases Half-life distribution: 2.7 minutes Half-life redistribution: 29 minutes Half-life elimination: 2.9 to 5.3 hours Metabolism Etomidate is highly protein-bound in blood plasma and is metabolised by hepatic and plasma esterases to inactive products. It exhibits a biexponential decline.",

        "content": "The heterogeneity of the buffalo k-casein, treated with 2-mercaptoethanol, has been estimated by disk gel-polyacrylamide electrophoresis on 428 caseins isolated from individual milks. The investigation showed six electrophoretic fractions: A, B, C, D, E, F, that, in ten buffalo farms considered formed ten different groups: ABCDEF; ABCDE; ABCEF; ABCE; BCDE; CDEF; BCE; CDE; CEF; and CE. The group ABCDE is the only that is present in all ten farms considered and presents on the whole, the greater number of observations (161). The fraction C is the most abundant. The investigation showed the heterogeneity of the gamma fraction, showing five electrophoretic fractions: A, B, C, D, E, that constitute the nine following groups; ABCDE; ABCD; BCDE; ABD; BCD; ABC; BD; BC and AB. At present a possible correlation to genetic factors seems hazardous.",
