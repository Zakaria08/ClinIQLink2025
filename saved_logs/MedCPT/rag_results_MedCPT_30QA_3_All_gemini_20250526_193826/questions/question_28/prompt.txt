Document 1 (Title: Cervical Cancer -- Evaluation): Colposcopy is the diagnostic procedure of choice for evaluating abnormal cytology and/or persistent high-risk HPV infection. The American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology (ASCCP) has issued guidance on procedural indications, and their recommended algorithms are considered standard of care. Multiple colposcopic-guided biopsies and endocervical sampling are often indicated, except during pregnancy. [21] Abnormal colposcopic findings may include acetowhite color change with the application of acetic acid, rich vascularity, atypical vessels, mosaicism, and punctation (see Image. Invasive Cervical Cancer).
Document 2 (Title: Gynecology_Novak): CHAPTER 19 Intraepithelial Disease of the Cervix, Vagina, and Vulva Figure 19.11 A: Mosaic pattern and punctation. This pattern develops as islands of dysplastic epithelium proliferate and push the ends of the superficial blood vessels away, creating a pattern that looks like mosaic tiles.

Document 3 (Title: Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia): Colposcopy can be painful and so researchers have tried to find which pain relief is best for women with CIN to use. Research suggests that compared to a placebo, the injection of a local anaesthetic and vasoconstrictor (medicine that causes blood vessels to narrow) into the cervix may lower blood loss and pain during colposcopy. HPV testing can identify most of the high-risk HPV types responsible for CIN. HPV screening happens either as a co-test with the Pap smear or can be done after a Pap smear showing abnormal cells, called reflex testing.Frequency of screening changes based on guidelines from the Society of Lower Genital Tract Disorders (ASCCP). The World Health Organization also has screening and treatment guidelines for precancerous cervical lesions and prevention of cervical cancer. Primary prevention HPV vaccination is the approach to primary prevention of both CIN and cervical cancer.
