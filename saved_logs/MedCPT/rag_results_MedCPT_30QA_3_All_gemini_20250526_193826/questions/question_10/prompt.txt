Document 1 (Title: Myocardial Protection -- Anatomy and Physiology -- Mitochondrial Protection): Mitochondrial protection is crucial because mitochondria, while providing ATP to cardiomyocytes, also play a central role in activating cell death pathways. The mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) is a nonselective channel in the inner mitochondrial membrane that remains closed during ischemia-induced acidosis, offering some protection. However, if the mPTP opens, it leads to depolarization, uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation, intracellular ATP depletion, and cell death. Protecting the heart during ischemia focuses on preventing mPTP opening and promoting the activation of the mitochondrial ATP-dependent potassium channel. This invokes 2 primary protective pathways: the reperfusion injury salvage kinase pathway, activated via G-protein-coupled receptors, and the survivor-activating factor enhancement pathway, which operates through tumor necrosis factor-alpha receptors.
Document 2 (Title: Programmed cell death): Basic morphological and biochemical features of PCD have been conserved in both plant and animal kingdoms. Specific types of plant cells carry out unique cell-death programs. These have common features with animal apoptosis—for instance, nuclear DNA degradation—but they also have their own peculiarities, such as nuclear degradation triggered by the collapse of the vacuole in tracheary elements of the xylem. Janneke Balk and Christopher J. Leaver, of the Department of Plant Sciences, University of Oxford, carried out research on mutations in the mitochondrial genome of sun-flower cells. Results of this research suggest that mitochondria play the same key role in vascular plant PCD as in other eukaryotic cells.
Document 3 (Title: Insect muscle as a model for programmed cell death.): Programmed cell death (PCD) is a fundamental component of development in virtually all animals. Despite the ubiquity of this phenomenon, little is known about what tells a cell to die, and less still about the physiological and molecular mechanisms that bring about death. One system that has proven to be very amenable for the study of PCD is the intersegmental muscle (ISM) of the tobacco hawkmoth Manduca sexta. These giant muscle cells are used during the eclosion (emergence) behavior of the adult moth, and then die during the subsequent 30 h. This review uses the ISMs as a model system to address questions that are basic to any cell death system, including the following: (1) how do cells know when to die; (2) what physiological changes accompany death; (3) what are the molecular mechanisms that mediate death; and (4) do all cells die by the same process? For the ISMs, the trigger for PCD is a decline in the circulating titer of the insect molting hormone, 20-hydroxyecdysone (20-HE). During cell death there are rapid decreases in both the myofibrillar sensitivity to intracellular calcium and the resulting force of fiber contraction. The ability of the ISMs to undergo PCD requires the repression and activation of specific genes. Two of the repressed genes encode actin and myosin. One of the upregulated presumptive cell-death genes encodes polyubiquitin, which appears to play a critical role in the rapid proteolysis that accompanies ISM death.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
