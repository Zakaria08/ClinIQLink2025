With your own knowledge and the help of the following document:

Document 1 (Title: Embolism): An embolus lodging in the brain from either the heart or a carotid artery will most likely be the cause of a stroke due to ischemia. An arterial embolus might originate in the heart (from a thrombus in the left atrium, following atrial fibrillation or be a septic embolus resulting from endocarditis). Emboli of cardiac origin are frequently encountered in clinical practice. Thrombus formation within the atrium occurs mainly in patients with mitral valve disease, and especially in those with mitral valve stenosis (narrowing), with atrial fibrillation (AF). In the absence of AF, pure mitral regurgitation has a low incidence of thromboembolism.
Document 2 (Title: [Optic nerve hemangioblastoma. Case report].): A solitary hemangioblastoma of the optic nerve was found in a 36-year-old male with a distinct family history of intracranial hemangioblastoma. The patient was admitted with complaints of visual loss and exophthalmos of the right eye. X-rays showed enlargement of the right optic canal. Right carotid angiography revealed a hypervascular tumor in the orbital apex, supplied by the ophthalmic artery. Computed tomography disclosed a pear-shaped, isodense mass with moderate contrast enhancement in the orbital apex. The right optic nerve was enlarged along its entire course and was involved with the apical mass. Surgery via the right frontal extradural approach disclosed a solid, vascular tumor involving the optic nerve at the apex of the orbit. Histological examination showed the tumor to be a characteristic hemangioblastoma. Over 90% of intracranial hemangioblastomas are located in the posterior fossa. Supratentorial hemangioblastomas, especially those arising in the optic nerve, are extremely rare. In addition, optic nerve hemangioblastomas are frequently familial and are associated with infratentorial hemangioblastomas, angiomatosis retinae, and cysts of the abdominal viscera.
Document 3 (Title: Stroke): In thrombotic stroke, a thrombus (blood clot) usually forms around atherosclerotic plaques. Since blockage of the artery is gradual, onset of symptomatic thrombotic strokes is slower than that of a hemorrhagic stroke. A thrombus itself (even if it does not completely block the blood vessel) can lead to an embolic stroke (see below) if the thrombus breaks off and travels in the bloodstream, at which point it is called an embolus. Two types of thrombosis can cause stroke: Large vessel disease involves the common and internal carotid arteries, the vertebral artery, and the Circle of Willis. Diseases that may form thrombi in the large vessels include (in descending incidence): atherosclerosis, vasoconstriction (tightening of the artery), aortic, carotid or vertebral artery dissection, various inflammatory diseases of the blood vessel wall (Takayasu arteritis, giant cell arteritis, vasculitis), noninflammatory vasculopathy, Moyamoya disease and fibromuscular dysplasia.
Document 4 (Title: Outline of cardiology): Carotid artery – Diseases of the carotid arteries: Carotid artery stenosis / carotid artery disease – Narrowing of the carotid artery, typically due to atherosclerosis. Carotid artery dissection – Dissection along the length of the carotid artery between the layers of the carotid wall and filled with blood. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) – Formation of a thrombus in a deep vein, commonly in the legs that may break loose, travel to the lungs, and occlude blood flow (pulmonary embolism) sufficient to interrupt oxygenation to the body. Traveller's thrombosis / economy class syndrome: A DVT due to being sedentary during air travel. Microangiopathy – Disease of capillaries in which the walls become thick and weak, and result in bleeding and decreased blood flow. One very common cause is diabetes mellitus in which microangiopathy results in diabetic nephropathy, diabetic retinopathy, and diabetic neuropathy.
Document 5 (Title: Aeris (airline)): Aeris was an airline company based in Toulouse, France. It was founded in 1969 and was defunct in 2003 after being unable to raise additional capital. Aeris offered charter flights until 2003, after acquiring 7,612 slots at Orly Airport due to the bankruptcy of Air Liberté. Aeris took on passengers as a low-cost carrier, competing with EasyJet and Air France for flights between Paris and south of France. Aeris aimed for business travelers, but was only able to fill about 60% of their seat capacity. In 2003 the company missed a government deadline to raise extra capital which was extended in August 2003, with the airline hoping to raise 15m euros in the following weeks from a mixture of foreign and domestic investors. At Paris, Aeris' 12,092 annual slots were redistributed after the bankruptcy. After rebranded as Aeris, the company began operation with a small fleet of Boeing 737-300 aircraft and 767-300 aircraft. These were generally operated in an all-economy configuration.
Document 6 (Title: Paradoxical embolism): Paradoxical embolisms represent two per cent of arterial emboli. Pathophysiology Passage of a clot (thrombus) from a systemic vein to a systemic artery. When clots in systemic veins break off (embolize), they travel first to the right side of the heart and, normally, then to the lungs where they lodge, causing pulmonary embolism. On the other hand, when there is a hole at the septum, either upper chambers of the heart (an atrial septal defect) or lower chambers of the heart (ventricular septal defects), a clot can cross from the right to the left side of the heart, then pass into the systemic arteries as a paradoxical embolism. Once in the arterial circulation, a clot can travel to the brain, block a vessel there, and cause a stroke (cerebrovascular accident). Diagnosis CT angiography; bubble echocardiography may also be used to detect a patent foramen ovale. Treatment
Document 7 (Title: Uterine artery embolization): Uterine artery embolization is a procedure in which an interventional radiologist uses a catheter to deliver small particles that block the blood supply to the uterine body. The procedure is done for the treatment of uterine fibroids and adenomyosis. This minimally invasive procedure is commonly used in the treatment of uterine fibroids and is also called uterine fibroid embolization. Medical uses Uterine artery embolization is used to treat bothersome bulk-related symptoms or abnormal or heavy uterine bleeding due to uterine fibroids or for the treatment of adenomyosis. Fibroid size, number, and location are three potential predictors of a successful outcome. Long-term patient satisfaction outcomes are similar to that of surgery. There is tentative evidence that traditional surgery may result in better fertility. Uterine artery embolization also appears to require more repeat procedures than if surgery was done initially.
Document 8 (Title: American Eagle Outfitters): In February 2006, American Eagle launched the aerie lingerie sub-brand, targeting the American 15- to 22-year-old female demographic segment. In addition to lingerie such as a wide variety of bras and other undergarments, the aerie line sells dorm wear, active apparel, loungewear, accessories and sleepwear. What started as a sub-brand quickly became a standalone concept in its own right, featuring a complete fitness line, called aerie f.i.t. The aerie brand is sold in American Eagle Outfitters stores, on-line through the American Eagle Web site, and in stand-alone aerie retail stores. The first stand-alone aerie store opened in August 2006 in Greenville, South Carolina, and was followed by two more test stores later that year. As of December 2010, there were 147 stand-alone aerie stores in the United States and in Canada.
Document 9 (Title: Hyaluronic acid): Hyaluronic acid has been used in various formulations to create artificial tears to treat dry eye. Hyaluronic acid is a common ingredient in skin care products. Hyaluronic acid is used as a dermal filler in cosmetic surgery. It is typically injected using either a classic sharp hypodermic needle or a micro-cannula. Some studies have suggested that the use of micro-cannulas can significantly reduce vessel embolisms during injections. Currently, hyaluronic acid is used frequently as a soft tissue filler due to its bio-compatibility and reversibility. Complications include the severing of nerves and microvessels, pain, and bruising. Some side effects can also appear by way of erythema, itching, and vascular occlusion; vascular occlusion is the most worrisome side effect due to the possibility of skin necrosis, or even blindness in a patient. In some cases, hyaluronic acid fillers can result in a granulomatous foreign body reaction.
Document 10 (Title: Thrombus): Pathophysiology A thrombus occurs when the hemostatic process, which normally occurs in response to injury, becomes activated in an uninjured or slightly injured vessel. A thrombus in a large blood vessel will decrease blood flow through that vessel (termed a mural thrombus). In a small blood vessel, blood flow may be completely cut off (termed an occlusive thrombus), resulting in death of tissue supplied by that vessel. If a thrombus dislodges and becomes free-floating, it is considered an embolus. If an embolus becomes trapped within a blood vessel, it blocks blood flow and is termed as an embolism. Embolisms, depending on their specific location, can cause more significant effects like strokes, heart attacks, or even death.
Document 11 (Title: [A case showing the infraoptic course of the anterior cerebral artery associated with anterior cerebral artery aneurysm].): A ruptured anterior cerebral artery aneurysm with anomalous right infraoptic course of the anterior cerebral artery (ACA) was reported. A 40-year old male was admitted because of SAH episode, and computerized tomography (CT) on the day of admission revealed hemorrhage in both Sylvian and interhemispheric fissures. Four-vessel angiography was performed on the same day. A saccular aneurysm was demonstrated in the region of the anterior communicating artery (ACoA), and anomalous artery, which originated from the intradural right carotid artery at the level of the right ophthalmic artery was found to be running medially and superiorly. It supplied the bilateral callosomarginal arteries and the unpaired pericallosal artery. The fenestration of the vertebral artery, duplication of bilateral superior cerebellar arteries, and an occipital artery arising from the right internal carotid artery at the C3 level were found. Surgery was performed on the first day of admission, and the anterior interhemispheric approach was selected. The anomalous branch of the right ICA ran beneath the right optic nerve, ascended between the optic nerves, and supplied the ACoA system. The left hypoplastic A1 segment entered the ACoA. However, the right A1 segment could not be found. The aneurysmal neck, situated between the bilateral callosomarginal arteries and the unpaired pericallosal artery, was clipped with Sugitas curved clip. The postoperative course was uneventful and a follow-up angiograph revealed successful obliteration of the aneurysm.
Document 12 (Title: Aerie): Aerie (a variant of eyrie) is the bird nest of an eagle, falcon, hawk, or other bird of prey. Aerie may also refer to: Arts, entertainment, and media Fictional entities Aerie (Baldur's Gate), a character in Baldur's Gate II Aerie Class, a class of Starfleet vessel in the Star Trek franchise Dragon Aerie, an area in Dark Souls II video game Literature Aerie (magazine), a literary magazine Aerie, a novel in The Dragon Jousters series by Mercedes Lackey Aerie, a 2003 novel by Thomas E. Sniegoski in The Fallen series Music Aerie (album), a 1971 album by John Denver "Aerie" (Gang of Eagles), a song by Jefferson Airplane on the album Long John Silver Other uses Aerie (American Eagle Outfitters), an intimate apparel brand of American Eagle Outfitters Aeries, the lodges of the Fraternal Order of Eagles See also Eagle's Nest (disambiguation) Eyrie (disambiguation)
Document 13 (Title: Graves' ophthalmopathy): In more severe and active disease, mass effects and cicatricial changes occur within the orbit. This is manifested by a progressive exophthalmos, a restrictive myopathy that restricts eye movements and an optic neuropathy. With enlargement of the extraocular muscle at the orbital apex, the optic nerve is at risk of compression. The orbital fat or the stretching of the nerve due to increased orbital volume may also lead to optic nerve damage. The patient experiences a loss of visual acuity, visual field defect, afferent pupillary defect, and loss of color vision. This is an emergency and requires immediate surgery to prevent permanent blindness. Pathophysiology TAO is an orbital autoimmune disease. The thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (TSH-R) is an antigen found in orbital fat and connective tissue, and is a target for autoimmune assault.
Document 14 (Title: Eye movement): Excyclotorsion is a term applied to the outward, torsional (rotational) movement of the eye, mediated by the inferior oblique muscle of the eye. The inferior oblique muscle is innervated by cranial nerve III (oculomotor nerve). Excyclotorsion may also be used to describe the condition or state of the eye when a patient has a cranial nerve IV (trochlear nerve) palsy. The trochlear nerve supplies the superior oblique muscle, and when this muscle is non-functional (as in trochlear palsy) the eye excyclotorts; i.e. twists/rotates outward. This excyclotorsion may be corrected through surgery using the Harada-Ito procedure. A version is an eye movement involving both eyes moving synchronously and symmetrically in the same direction. Examples include: Dextroversion / right gaze Laevoversion / left gaze Sursumversion / elevation / up gaze Deorsumversion / depression / down gaze Dextroelevation / gaze up and right Dextrodepression / gaze down and right Laevoelevation / gaze up and left
Document 15 (Title: Aneurysm mimicking intracranial growth of optic nerve sheath meningioma.): A patient with a 30-year history of blindness in the right eye developed progressive temporal visual loss in the left eye. Examination showed right optic atrophy with optociliary shunts and left band atrophy. These clinical findings suggested that the visual deficit was caused by a right optic nerve sheath meningioma that had grown intracranially to involve the chiasm. Magnetic resonance imaging and surgical exploration revealed a perioptic meningioma extending from the orbit through the optic canal and over the tuberculum sellae. The tumor did not impinge on the optic chiasm or the left optic nerve. The chiasm was compressed by a thrombosed giant right internal carotid artery aneurysm.
