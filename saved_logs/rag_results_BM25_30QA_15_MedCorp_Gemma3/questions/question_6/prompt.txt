Document 1 (Title: Diethylene glycol): At first, scientists thought that DEG metabolized into ethylene glycol, which is poisonous due to the metabolic production of glycolic acid, glyoxylic acid, and ultimately oxalic acid. The major cause of ethylene glycol toxicity is the accumulation of glycolic acid in the body, but the accumulation of calcium oxalate crystals in the kidneys can also lead to acute kidney failure. In the case of DEG, observations demonstrated there were no calcium oxalate crystal deposits in the kidneys, implying ethylene glycol is not on the DEG metabolic pathway. Rat models suggest DEG is metabolized in the liver by enzyme NAD-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) into a hydrogen ion, NADH and 2-hydroxyethoxyacetaldehyde (C4H8O3). Shortly after, 2-hydroxyethoxyacetaldehyde (C4H8O3) is metabolized by the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) into the weak acid 2-hydroxyethoxyacetic acid (HEAA) with chemical formula C4H8O4. Later on, HEAA leaves the liver through the bloodstream, being partially filtered
Document 2 (Title: Ethylene oxide): Ethylene oxide causes acute poisoning, accompanied by a variety of symptoms. Central nervous system effects are frequently associated with human exposure to ethylene oxide in occupational settings. Headache, nausea, and vomiting have been reported. Peripheral neuropathy, impaired hand-eye coordination and memory loss have been reported in more recent case studies of chronically-exposed workers at estimated average exposure levels as low as 3 ppm (with possible short-term peaks as high as 700ppm). The metabolism of ethylene oxide is not completely known. Data from animal studies indicate two possible pathways for the metabolism of ethylene oxide: hydrolysis to ethylene glycol and glutathione conjugation to form mercapturic acid and meththio-metabolites. Ethylene oxide easily penetrates through ordinary clothing and footwear, causing skin irritation and dermatitis with the formation of blisters, fever and leukocytosis.
Document 3 (Title: Diethylene glycol): Diethylene glycol has moderate acute toxicity in animal experiments. The LD50 for small mammals has been tested at between 2 and 25 g/kg, less toxic than its relative ethylene glycol, but still capable of causing toxicity in humans. It appears diethylene glycol is more hazardous to humans than implied by oral toxicity data in laboratory animals. Toxicokinetics Although there is limited information about toxicokinetics in humans, observations in mass poisonings and experimental studies suggest the following information: Absorption and distribution The principal method of absorption is through oral ingestion. Dermal absorption is very low, unless it is administered on broken or damaged skin. After ingestion, DEG is absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract and distributed by the bloodstream throughout the body, reaching peak blood concentrations within 30 to 120 minutes. Once DEG reaches the liver, it is metabolized by enzymes.
Document 4 (Title: Blacklight): Fungal and bacterial infections It is also helpful in diagnosing: Fungal infections. Some forms of tinea, such as Trichophyton tonsurans, do not fluoresce. Bacterial infections Corynebacterium minutissimum is coral red Pseudomonas is yellow-green Cutibacterium acnes, a bacterium involved in acne causation, exhibits an orange glow under a Wood's lamp. Ethylene glycol poisoning A Wood's lamp may be used to rapidly assess whether an individual is suffering from ethylene glycol poisoning as a consequence of antifreeze ingestion. Manufacturers of ethylene glycol-containing antifreezes commonly add fluorescein, which causes the patient's urine to fluoresce under Wood's lamp.
Document 5 (Title: Alcohol dehydrogenase): Drug dependence Drug dependence is another problem associated with ADH, which researchers think might be linked to alcoholism. One particular study suggests that drug dependence has seven ADH genes associated with it, however, more research is necessary. Alcohol dependence and other drug dependence may share some risk factors, but because alcohol dependence is often comorbid with other drug dependences, the association of ADH with the other drug dependencies may not be causal. Poisoning Fomepizole, a drug that competitively inhibits alcohol dehydrogenase, can be used in the setting of acute methanol or ethylene glycol toxicity. This prevents the conversion of the methanol or ethylene glycol to its toxic metabolites (such as formic acid, formaldehyde, or glycolate). The same effect is also sometimes achieved with ethanol, again by competitive inhibition of ADH.
Document 6 (Title: Drug overdose): Causes The drugs or toxins that are most frequently involved in overdose and death (grouped by ICD-10): Acute alcohol intoxication (F10) Ethyl alcohol Methanol poisoning Ethylene glycol poisoning Opioid overdose (F11) Among sedative-hypnotics (F13) Barbiturate overdose (T42.3) Benzodiazepine overdose (T42.4) Uncategorized sedative-hypnotics (T42.6) Ethchlorvynol (Placidyl) GHB Glutethimide (Doriden) Methaqualone Ketamine (T41.2) Among stimulants (F14-F15) Cocaine overdose (T40.5) Amphetamine overdose (T43.6) Methamphetamine overdose (T43.6) Among tobacco (F17) Nicotine poisoning (T65.2) Among poly drug use (F19) Drug "cocktails" (speedballs) Medications Aspirin poisoning (T39.0) Paracetamol poisoning (Alone or mixed with oxycodone) Paracetamol toxicity (T39.1) Tricyclic antidepressant overdose (T43.0) Vitamin poisoning Pesticide poisoning (T60) Organophosphate poisoning DDT Inhalants Lithium toxicity
Document 7 (Title: List of dog diseases): Urinary and reproductive systems Kidney diseases Fanconi syndrome is a type of renal tubule disease found in Basenjis. Findings include the inability to concentrate urine, and the presence of glucose, protein, and amino acids in the urine. Kidney failure * is common in dogs and may be found in acute or chronic forms. It is defined by a loss of function of about 75 percent of the filtration system of the kidney and characterized by azotemia and low specific gravity of the urine. Acute kidney injury can be caused by loss of blood supply, hypercalcemia, or toxins such as ethylene glycol (antifreeze) or aminoglycoside antibiotics (see: ethylene glycol poisoning). Chronic kidney failure can be congenital and/or inherited or caused by cancer, infection, hypertension, glomerulonephritis, amyloidosis, progressive interstitial fibrosis, or any of the causes of acute kidney injury.
Document 8 (Title: Fomepizole): Medical use Fomepizole is used to treat ethylene glycol and methanol poisoning. It acts to inhibit the breakdown of these toxins into their active toxic metabolites. Fomepizole is a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase, found in the liver. This enzyme plays a key role in the metabolism of ethylene glycol, and of methanol. Ethylene glycol is first metabolized to glycolaldehyde by alcohol dehydrogenase. Glycolaldehyde then undergoes further oxidation to glycolate, glyoxylate, and oxalate. Glycolate and oxalate are the primary toxins responsible for the metabolic acidosis, and for the renal damage, seen in ethylene glycol poisoning. Methanol is first metabolized to formaldehyde by alcohol dehydrogenase. Formaldehyde then undergoes further oxidation, via formaldehyde dehydrogenase, to become formic acid. Formic acid is the primary toxin responsible for the metabolic acidosis, and for the visual disturbances, associated with methanol poisoning.
Document 9 (Title: Nitrofurazone): Adverse effects Adverse effects for topical use are generally mild and include, erythema, pruritus, dermatitis, rash, edema or inflammation. Contraindications People with chronic kidney disease and large total body surface area (TBSA) burns should not use nitrofurazone, as topical preparations commonly contain polyethylene glycol, which is readily absorbed through the skin. Rapid absorption of the medication induces increased serum osmolalities and anion gap, leading to death. Symptoms are similar to ethylene glycol poisoning, in that increased serum calcium levels occur concurrently with decreased ionized calcium. Nitrofurans have been found in honey, meat and seafood. In people who have glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G-6-PD deficiency), ingestion of fish, poultry, or other foodstuff that has been treated with nitrofurans, will likely suffer from hemolysis of red blood cells as a result of eating the contaminated food.
Document 10 (Title: Diethylene glycol): 2020 - India In the first week of 2020, around 17 children from Ramnagar, in the union territory of Jammu and Kashmir, were hospitalised, more than half of whom died of kidney failure. The regional drug controller authorities after investigation found out that a faulty batch of the Coldbest PC cough syrup contained 34.97% of diethylene glycol, which resulted in poisoning and subsequent renal failures. The product was recalled and after an investigation, the Drug Controller General of India, VG Somani, said at India Pharma 2020, that the GMP was not followed, and negligence was found during the production process itself. The Himachal Pradesh government is filing a criminal case against the company and its executives.

Document 11 (Title: Antifreeze): When ethylene glycol is used in a system, it may become oxidized to five organic acids (formic, oxalic, glycolic, glyoxalic and acetic acid). Inhibited ethylene glycol antifreeze mixes are available, with additives that buffer the pH and reserve alkalinity of the solution to prevent oxidation of ethylene glycol and formation of these acids. Nitrites, silicates, borates and azoles may also be used to prevent corrosive attack on metal. Ethylene glycol has a bitter, sweet taste and causes inebriation. The toxic effects of ingesting ethylene glycol occur because it is converted by the liver into 4 other chemicals that are much more toxic. The lethal dose of pure ethylene glycol is 1.4 ml/kg ( is lethal to a person) but is much less lethal if treated within an hour. (see Ethylene glycol poisoning). Propylene glycol
Document 12 (Title: Dialysis): Acute indications Indications for dialysis in a patient with acute kidney injury are summarized with the vowel mnemonic of "AEIOU": Acidemia from metabolic acidosis in situations in which correction with sodium bicarbonate is impractical or may result in fluid overload. Electrolyte abnormality, such as severe hyperkalemia, especially when combined with AKI. Intoxication, that is, acute poisoning with a dialyzable substance. These substances can be represented by the mnemonic SLIME: salicylic acid, lithium, isopropanol, magnesium-containing laxatives and ethylene glycol. Overload of fluid not expected to respond to treatment with diuretics Uremia complications, such as pericarditis, encephalopathy, or gastrointestinal bleeding.

Document 14 (Title: [Acute ethylene glycol poisoning with the course resembling the development of intracranial hematoma].): Acute poisoning with ethylene glycol manifests itself often with symptoms of central nervous system involvement. The predominating manifestations include consciousness disturbances, seizures, while focal brain damage signs are less frequent. The reported case was hospitalized after trauma to the head and spine, and had signs suggesting expanding intracranial haematoma. CT excluded haematoma and toxicological investigations demonstrated acute poisoning with ethylene glycol.
Document 15 (Title: Ethylene oxide): Applications Ethylene oxide is one of the most important raw materials used in large-scale chemical production. Most ethylene oxide is used for synthesis of ethylene glycols, including diethylene glycol and triethylene glycol, that accounts for up to 75% of global consumption. Other important products include ethylene glycol ethers, ethanolamines and ethoxylates. Among glycols, ethylene glycol is used as antifreeze, in the production of polyester and polyethylene terephthalate (PET – raw material for plastic bottles), liquid coolants and solvents.
