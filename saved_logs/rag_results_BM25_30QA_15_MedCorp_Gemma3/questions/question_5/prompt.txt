Document 1 (Title: Osteoblast): Osteoblasts separate bone from the extracellular fluid by tight junctions by regulated transport. Unlike in cartilage, phosphate and calcium cannot move in or out by passive diffusion, because the tight osteoblast junctions isolate the bone formation space. Calcium is transported across osteoblasts by facilitated transport (that is, by passive transporters, which do not pump calcium against a gradient). In contrast, phosphate is actively produced by a combination of secretion of phosphate-containing compounds, including ATP, and by phosphatases that cleave phosphate to create a high phosphate concentration at the mineralization front. Alkaline phosphatase is a membrane-anchored protein that is a characteristic marker expressed in large amounts at the apical (secretory) face of active osteoblasts.
Document 2 (Title: Osteocalcin): Use as a biochemical marker for bone formation As osteocalcin is produced by osteoblasts, it is often used as a marker for the bone formation process. It has been observed that higher serum osteocalcin levels are relatively well correlated with increases in bone mineral density during treatment with anabolic bone formation drugs for osteoporosis, such as teriparatide. In many studies, osteocalcin is used as a preliminary biomarker on the effectiveness of a given drug on bone formation. For instance, one study which aimed to study the effectiveness of a glycoprotein called lactoferrin on bone formation used osteocalcin as a measure of osteoblast activity.

Document 3 (Title: Bone scintigraphy): Principle The most common radiopharmaceutical for bone scintigraphy is 99mTc with methylene diphosphonate (MDP). Other bone radiopharmaceuticals include 99mTc with HDP, HMDP and DPD. MDP adsorbs onto the crystalline hydroxyapatite mineral of bone. Mineralisation occurs at osteoblasts, representing sites of bone growth, where MDP (and other diphosphates) "bind to the hydroxyapatite crystals in proportion to local blood flow and osteoblastic activity and are therefore markers of bone turnover and bone perfusion". The more active the bone turnover, the more radioactive material will be seen. Some tumors, fractures and infections show up as areas of increased uptake.
Document 4 (Title: RUNX2): The cellular dynamics of Runx2 protein are also important for proper osteoblast differentiation. Runx2 protein is detected in preosteoblasts and the expression is upregulated in immature osteoblasts and downregulated in mature osteoblasts. It is the first transcription factor required for determination of osteoblast commitment, followed by Sp7 and Wnt-signaling. Runx2 is responsible for inducing the differentiation of multipotent mesenchymal cells into immature osteoblasts, as well as activating expression of several key downstream proteins that maintain osteoblast differentiation and bone matrix genes. Knock-out of the DNA-binding activity results in inhibition of osteoblastic differentiation. Because of this, Runx2 is often referred to as the master regulator of bone. Cell cycle regulation
Document 5 (Title: Betacellulin): Osteoblasts, which are responsible for forming and mineralizing osteoid, express EGFRs and alter rates of proliferation and differentiation in response to EGF receptor activation. Transgenic mice over-expressing the EGF-like ligand betacellulin (BTC) exhibit increased cortical bone deposition; however , because the transgene is ubiquitously expressed in these mice, the identity of cells affected by BTC and responsible for increased cortical bone thickness remains unknown. BTC decreases the expression of osteogenic markers in both MSCs (mesenchymal stem cell) and pre-osteoblasts increases in proliferation require hypoxia-inducible factor-alpha (HIF-alpha), as an HIF antagonist prevents BTC-driven proliferation. Both MSCs and pre-osteoblasts express EGF receptors ErbB1, ErbB2, and ErbB3, with no change in expression under osteogenic differentiation. These are the first data that demonstrate an influence of BTC upon MSCs and the first to implicate HIF-alpha in BTC-mediated proliferation.
Document 6 (Title: Osteostimulation): Osteostimulation is a technique attempted for improving healing of bone injuries or defects. It has not however been found to be significantly effective in increasing bone healing. It is believed to work through the active stimulation of osteoblast proliferation and differentiation as evidenced by increased levels of DNA synthesis and of the osteoblast markers osteocalcin and alkaline phosphatase. Through an ionic exchange, Bioglass first acts as a scaffolding around and through which new bone forms. In vivo studies have demonstrated that the osteostimulative properties result in stimulation and acceleration of new bone formation in an osseous defect.

Document 7 (Title: Jeju language): can only be followed by a small number of suffixes in Yang C., Yang S., and O'Grady 2019's analysis. Some analyses treat the initial vowel of the following suffix as part of an allomorph or nuanced variant of , so that "[I] will go" may be segmented as or . The realis or indicative mood marker indicates "a fact or habitual action in the nonpast" which the speaker perceives to be true in general, permanently, or over a longer duration of time, as demonstrated in the contrast below. The putative non-past-tense marker may also be analyzed as an allomorph of . In this context, the morpheme has also been interpreted as a perfect marker (not to be confused with the perfective marker).
Document 8 (Title: Interleukin 6): Interleukin 6 (IL-6) is an interleukin that acts as both a pro-inflammatory cytokine and an anti-inflammatory myokine. In humans, it is encoded by the IL6 gene. In addition, osteoblasts secrete IL-6 to stimulate osteoclast formation. Smooth muscle cells in the tunica media of many blood vessels also produce IL-6 as a pro-inflammatory cytokine. IL-6's role as an anti-inflammatory myokine is mediated through its inhibitory effects on TNF-alpha and IL-1 and its activation of IL-1ra and IL-10. There is some early evidence that IL-6 can be used as an inflammatory marker for severe COVID-19 infection with poor prognosis, in the context of the wider coronavirus pandemic.

Document 9 (Title: LNCaP): When cultured in a “promineralization medium” that contains ascorbic acid (known to promote skeletal-like ECM formation in osteoblasts) and a source of phosphate (for hydroxyapatite formation), C4-2B cells produce and retain approximately 8x more mineralized calcium than parental LNCaP cells. C4-2B cells also express higher levels of osteoprotegerin (OPG), alkaline phosphatase, bone sialoprotein (BSP), Osteocalcin (OCN), RANKL, and Osteonectin (OSN) mRNA, all of which are highly expressed by osteoblasts. Osteoblast promoter activity is also higher in C4-2B cells when compared to LNCaP, as indicated by Cbfa1 transcription factor expression. Concomitantly, BMP7, a known inducer of Cbfa1, is also more highly expressed in C4-2B cells, further suggesting many osteoblast-like properties. Androgen Independent Variants
Document 10 (Title: Choctaw language): Verb prefixes The verbal prefixes convey information about the arguments of the verb: how many there are and their person and number features. The prefixes can be divided into three sorts: agreement markers, applicative markers, and anaphors (reflexives and reciprocals). The prefixes occur in the following order: agreement-anaphor-applicative-verb stem. Agreement affixes The agreement affixes are shown in the following chart. The only suffix among the personal agreement markers is the first-person singular class I agreement marker /-li/. Third-person is completely unmarked for class I and class II agreement arguments and never indicates number. Some authors (Ulrich 1986, Davies, 1986) refer to class I as actor or nominative, class II as patient or accusative and class III as dative. Broadwell prefers the neutral numbered labels because the actual use of the affixes is more complex. This type of morphology is generally referred to as active–stative and polypersonal agreement.
Document 11 (Title: Factors that promote progressive development of the osteoblast phenotype in cultured fetal rat calvaria cells.): Rat calvaria osteoblasts derived from 21-day-old fetal rat pups undergo a temporal expression of markers of the osteoblast phenotype during a 5 week culture period. Alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin are sequentially expressed in relation to collagen accumulation and mineralization. This pattern of expression of these osteoblast parameters in cultured rat osteoblasts (ROB) is analogous to that seen in vivo in developing fetal rat calvaria tissue (Yoon et. al: Biochem. Biophis. Res. Commun. 148:1129, 1987) and is similar to that observed in cultures of subcultivated 16-day-old embryonic chick calvaria-derived osteoblasts (COB) (Gerstenfeld, et.al: Dev. Biol. 122:46, 1987). While the cellular organization of subcultivated COB and primary ROB cultures are somewhat different, the temporal expression of the parameters remains. Both the rat and chick culture systems support formation of matrix mineralization even in the absence of beta-glycerol-phosphate. A systematic examination of factors which constitute conditions supporting complete expression of the osteoblast phenotype in ROB cultures indicate requirements for specific serum lots, ascorbic acid and the ordered deposition of mineral in the extracellular matrix. The present studies suggest that formation of a collagenous matrix, dependent on ascorbic acid, is requisite for expression of the osteoblast phenotype. In ROB cultures, expression of osteocalcin synthesis occurs subsequent to initiation of alkaline phosphatase activity and accompanies the formation of mineralized nodules. Thus, extracellular matrix mineralization (deposition of hydroxyapatite) is required for complete development of the osteoblast phenotype, as reflected by a 200-fold increase in osteocalcin synthesis. These data show the temporal expression of the various osteoblast parameters during the formation and mineralization of an extracellular matrix can provide markers reflective of various stages of osteoblast differentiation/maturation in vitro.
Document 12 (Title: RUNX2): It has also been suggested that Runx2 plays a cell proliferation regulatory role in cell cycle entry and exit in osteoblasts, as well as endothelial cells. Runx2 suppresses pre-osteoblast proliferation by affecting cell cycle progression in the G1 phase. In osteoblasts, the levels of Runx2 is highest in G1 phase and is lowest in S, G2, and M. The comprehensive cell cycle regulatory mechanisms that Runx2 may play are still unknown, although it is generally accepted that the varying activity and levels of Runx2 throughout the cell cycle contribute to cell cycle entry and exit, as well as cell cycle progression. These functions are especially important when discussing bone cancer, particularly osteosarcoma development, that can be attributed to aberrant cell proliferation control.

Document 13 (Title: Tc-99m HMDP bone scintigraphic findings in association with concurrent serum osteocalcin measurements.): Osteocalcin is a noncollagenous bone protein produced by osteoblasts. Increase in serum osteocalcin level reflects osteoblast activity with acceleration of bone formation. To evaluate the correlation of Tc-HDP bone scintigraphic findings and concurrent serum osteocalcin, serum osteocalcin values of 40 consecutive patients were measured by radioimmunoassay at the time of initial referral for bone studies. These patients, all males aged 23-93, were studied for various disease entities, including prostate carcinoma. The results of the assay were categorized into three groups (gp) as follows: 17 at normal (1.8 to 6.6 ng/ml) level (gp 1), 21 low (gp 2), and two high (gp 3). Only one bronchogenic carcinoma patient with a high level had a right iliac lesion suggesting metastasis. The bone scans of nine patients with normal or low levels showed positive metastases. Two patients with stress fractures as shown on bone scans had normal levels. The images of patients with disparity between serum osteocalcin and positive bone lesions may be interpreted as follows: Instead of osteoblastic activity resulting in the synthesis and/or release of osteocalcin, area(s) of increased uptake in the bone scan may be predominantly reflecting increased regional blood flow and decreased sympathetic tone, resulting in an increase in bone-agent deposition.
Document 14 (Title: Osteocyte): During bone formation, an osteoblast is left behind and buried in the bone matrix as an "osteoid osteocyte", which maintains contact with other osteoblasts through extended cellular processes. The process of osteocytogenesis is largely unknown, but the following molecules have been shown to play a crucial role in the production of healthy osteocytes, either in correct numbers or specific distributions: matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP-1), osteoblast/osteocyte factor 45 (OF45), Klotho, TGF-beta inducible factor (TIEG), lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), E11 antigen, and oxygen. 10–20% of osteoblasts differentiate into osteocytes. Those osteoblasts on the bone surface that are destined for burial as osteocytes slow down matrix production, and are buried by neighboring osteoblasts that continue to produce matrix actively.
Document 15 (Title: Evidence for heterogeneity of the osteoblastic phenotype determined with clonal rat bone cells established from transforming growth factor-beta-induced cell colonies grown anchorage independently in semisolid medium.): Numerous reports have appeared in the literature indicating phenotypic heterogeneity among cells of the osteoblastic lineage. This diversity may be due to either certain stages of differentiation or a subspecialization of already terminally differentiated osteoblasts. To obtain answers to this question, we report on studies undertaken to clone bone cell populations from 1 day postnatal rat calvaria which express well defined differences in phenotype. To achieve this goal, we have used the soft agarose cloning technique which previously has almost exclusively been applied to clone cells of neoplastic origin. The reason for being able to employ this method is based on the fact that bone cells can be induced by transforming growth factor-beta to reversibly acquire the transformed phenotype, an event expressed by anchorage-dependent bone cells to form progressively growing colonies in soft agarose. Individual colonies, harvested from agarose, were expanded to clonal bone cell populations. Characterizing 48 cell clones by detection of osteoblastic cell markers such as alkaline phosphatase activity, PTH- and prostaglandin-E2-induced adenylate cyclase activity, osteocalcin mRNA synthesis, as well as collagen synthesis, 7 subsets of osteoblastic cell types were identified. Each subset was found to express a distinct phenotype, indicated by the absence or presence of osteoblastic cell markers. Some clones, previously found not to exhibit any osteoblastic traits, developed PTH responsiveness when treated with insulin-like growth factor-I/transforming growth factor-beta, suggesting that these clones may originate from the osteoprogenitor cell pool. While most clonal cell populations were characterized as fully functional osteoblastic cells, some clones expressed merely 1, 2, or 3 osteoblastic markers, which suggests that they may represent stages of differentiation along the osteogenic pathway. In addition, other subclones displayed the capacity to synthesize osteocalcin and showed PTH and prostaglandin-E2 responsiveness, but were found to be devoid of alkaline phosphatase activity. Others expressed all osteoblastic cell markers except PTH responsiveness. The phenotypic constellation of the latter suggests that these cell clones may represent mature osteoblast-like cells, which, perhaps due to environmental circumstances present at the time of isolation, have become altered in accordance with the physiological requirements of the tissue.
