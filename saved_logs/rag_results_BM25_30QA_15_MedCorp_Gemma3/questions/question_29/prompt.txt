Document 1 (Title: Etomidate): Pharmacokinetics At the typical dose, anesthesia is induced for the duration of about 5–10 minutes, though the half-life of drug metabolism is about 75 minutes, because etomidate is redistributed from the plasma to other tissues. Onset of action: 30–60 seconds Peak effect: 1 minute Duration: 3–5 minutes; terminated by redistribution Distribution: Vd: 2–4.5 L/kg Protein binding: 76% Metabolism: Hepatic and plasma esterases Half-life distribution: 2.7 minutes Half-life redistribution: 29 minutes Half-life elimination: 2.9 to 5.3 hours Metabolism Etomidate is highly protein-bound in blood plasma and is metabolised by hepatic and plasma esterases to inactive products. It exhibits a biexponential decline.
Document 2 (Title: Fentanyl): Obstetrics Fentanyl is sometimes given intrathecally as part of spinal anesthesia or epidurally for epidural anaesthesia and analgesia. Because of fentanyl's high lipid solubility, its effects are more localized than morphine, and some clinicians prefer to use morphine to get a wider spread of analgesia. However, it is widely used in obstetrical anesthesia because of its short time to action peak (about 5 min), the rapid termination of its effect after a single dose, and the occurrence of relative cardiovascular stability. In obstetrics, the dose must be closely regulated in order to prevent large amounts of transfer from mother to fetus. At high doses, the drug may act on the fetus to cause postnatal respiratory distress. For this reason, shorter acting agents such as alfentanyl or remifentanil may be more suitable in the context of inducing general anaesthesia. Pain management
Document 3 (Title: Mexiletine): Adverse effects Common side effects of mexiletine include abdominal pain, chest discomfort, drowsiness, headache, nausea and skin reactions. Uncommon or rare side effects include seizures and liver dysfunction. Pharmacology Mexiletine is an oral analogue of lidocaine. It is a class IB antiarrhythmic which shorten the refractory period and action potential duration (APD). Decrease in APD more than that of ERP so there is increase ERP/APD ratio. The drug has a bioavailability of 90%, and peak plasma concentrations are seen after 2–4 hours. The mean drug half-life is approximately 11 hours. Mexiletine is predominantly metabolised by the liver. The pharmacokinetics of mexiletine are preserved with even moderate to severe renal impairment, but dose adjustment may be required when creatinine clearance falls below 10 mL/minute. Synthesis
Document 4 (Title: Alpha-1 blocker): Elimination: Elimination half-life for alfuzosin is around 8 hours, alfuzosin is metabolised mainly via liver. 75–91% is excreted in feces and 35% in unchanged form. Distribution volume and excretion increases with renal impairment due to less protein binding, but the half-life elimination rate is unchanged. therefore no dose adjustment is needed for low to moderate renal impairment. Delay in elimination half-life, peak concentration in plasma is double and bioavailability is changed in hepatic impairment patients. Alfuzosin should not be used for patients with renal impairment. Tamsulosin is excreted via urine and 9% of that is unchanged on its active form, elimination half-life for tamsulosin is between 9–13 hours for healthy volunteers. The elimination half-life for target patients is around 14–15 hours. No dose adjustment is needed for patients with renal impairment and moderate hepatic impairment. 10–20% of terazosin is excreted unchanged in urine and feces during oral
Document 5 (Title: Moclobemide): In humans moclobemide is rapidly and almost completely absorbed and totally metabolised via the liver. Peak plasma levels occur 0.3 to 2 hours after oral administration. The bioavailability increases during the first week of therapy from 60% to 80% and more. The elimination half-life is around 2 hours. It is moderately bound to plasma proteins, especially albumin. However, the short disposition half life somewhat increases after repeated dosing; moclobemide has an intermediate elimination half life for systemic clearance and an intermediate volume of distribution. Despite its short half-life the pharmacodynamic action of a single dose persists for approximately 16 hours. The drug is almost completely metabolized in the liver; it is a substrate of CYP2C19 and an inhibitor of CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP1A2. Less than 1 percent of the drug is excreted unchanged; 92 percent of the metabolised drug is excreted within the first 12 hours. The main metabolites are the N-oxide Ro 12-5637 formed
Document 6 (Title: Clotiazepam): Clotiazepam has a short elimination half-life and is less prone to accumulation after repeated dosing compared to longer-acting benzodiazepine agents. It is metabolised via oxidation. Clotiazepam is metabolised to hydroxy-clotiazepam and desmethyl-clotiazepam. After oral ingestion of a single 5 mg dose of clotiazepam by three healthy volunteers the drug was rapidly absorbed. The elimination half-life of the drug and its metabolites range from 6.5 hours to 18 hours. Clotiazepam is 99 percent bound to plasma protein. In elderly men the elimination half-life is longer and in elderly women the volume of distribution is increased. Individuals with liver impairment have a reduced volume of distribution as well as a reduced total clearance of clotiazepam; renal impairment does not affect the kinetics of clotiazepam. The dose equivalent to 10mg diazepam is thought to be between 5 and 10mg clotiazepam.
Document 7 (Title: Hydromorphone): Pharmacokinetics The chemical modification of the morphine molecule to hydromorphone results in higher lipid solubility and greater ability to cross the blood–brain barrier to produce more rapid and complete central nervous system penetration. On a per milligram basis, hydromorphone is considered to be five times as potent as morphine; although the conversion ratio may vary from 4–8 times, five times is in typical clinical usage. The development of tolerance also may vary among individuals. Patients with renal abnormalities must exercise caution when dosing hydromorphone. In those with renal impairment, the half-life of hydromorphone may increase to as much as 40 hours. The typical half-life of intravenous hydromorphone is 2.3 hours. Peak plasma levels usually occur between 30 and 60 minutes after oral dosing. The onset of action for hydromorphone administered intravenously is less than 5 minutes and within 30 minutes of oral administration (immediate release). Metabolism
Document 8 (Title: Esmolol): Esmolol is considered a soft drug, one that is rapidly metabolized to an inactive form. Esmolol is rapidly metabolized by hydrolysis of the ester linkage, chiefly by the esterases in the cytosol of red blood cells and not by plasma cholinesterases or red cell membrane acetylcholinesterase. Total body clearance in man was found to be about 20 L/kg/hr, which is greater than cardiac output; thus the metabolism of esmolol is not limited by the rate of blood flow to metabolizing tissues such as the liver or affected by hepatic or renal blood flow. Esmolol's short duration of action is based on the ester-methyl side chain which allows for quick hydrolysis. Esmolol's structure is reflected in its name, es-molol as in ester-methyl. Plasma cholinesterases and red cell membrane acetylcholinesterase do not have any action. This metabolism results in the formation of a free acid and methanol. The amount of methanol produced is similar to endogenous methanol production. Esmolol has a rapid
Document 9 (Title: Bupivacaine): Pharmacokinetics The rate of systemic absorption of bupivacaine and other local anesthetics is dependent upon the dose and concentration of drug administered, the route of administration, the vascularity of the administration site, and the presence or absence of epinephrine in the preparation. Onset of action (route and dose-dependent): 1-17 min Duration of action (route and dose-dependent): 2-9 hr Half life: neonates, 8.1 hr, adults: 2.7 hr Time to peak plasma concentration (for peripheral, epidural, or caudal block): 30-45 min Protein binding: about 95% Metabolism: hepatic Excretion: renal (6% unchanged)
Document 10 (Title: Alpha-1 blocker): is around 14–15 hours. No dose adjustment is needed for patients with renal impairment and moderate hepatic impairment. 10–20% of terazosin is excreted unchanged in urine and feces during oral administration. 40% is eliminated in urine and 60% in feces. Eliminations half-life for terazosin is between 8–13 hours. No dose adjustment is needed for patients with renal impairment. Terazosin is metabolised by the liver and is excreted by the biliary tract, so patients with moderate hepatic impairment should receive titrated doses of terazosin witch caution. Patients with severe hepatic impairment should not take terazosin due to lack of clinical data.
Document 11 (Title: Tilidine): The elimination half-life for nortilidine is 3-5 hours. Tilidine is metabolised to 90% and eliminated renally. The rest appears in the faeces. Depending on the extent of the impairment, the maximum concentration of nortilidine in plasma is lower in liver function than in healthy individuals and the half-life is prolonged. In case of severe hepatic insufficiency the therapy is questionable. In these cases, it is possible that the formation of active nortilidine may be so low that the analgesic effect is insufficient. In addition, in the combination preparations with naloxone, the inactivation of the same can only be insufficient. The consequent antagonisation of the nortilidine effect can lead to a further loss of activity.
Document 12 (Title: Erythromycin): Metabolism Most of erythromycin is metabolised by demethylation in the liver by the hepatic enzyme CYP3A4. Its main elimination route is in the bile with little renal excretion, 2%-15% unchanged drug. Erythromycin's elimination half-life ranges between 1.5 and 2.0 hours and is between 5 and 6 hours in patients with end-stage renal disease. Erythromycin levels peak in the serum 4 hours after dosing; ethylsuccinate peaks 0.5-2.5 hours after dosing, but can be delayed if digested with food. Erythromycin crosses the placenta and enters breast milk. The American Association of Pediatrics determined erythromycin is safe to take while breastfeeding. Absorption in pregnant patients has been shown to be variable, frequently resulting in levels lower than in nonpregnant patients. Chemistry Composition
Document 13 (Title: Pharmacodynamics): Therapeutic window The therapeutic window is the amount of a medication between the amount that gives an effect (effective dose) and the amount that gives more adverse effects than desired effects. For instance, medication with a small pharmaceutical window must be administered with care and control, e.g. by frequently measuring blood concentration of the drug, since it easily loses effects or gives adverse effects. Duration of action The duration of action of a drug is the length of time that particular drug is effective. Duration of action is a function of several parameters including plasma half-life, the time to equilibrate between plasma and target compartments, and the off rate of the drug from its biological target.
Document 14 (Title: Etomidate): Metabolism Etomidate is highly protein-bound in blood plasma and is metabolised by hepatic and plasma esterases to inactive products. It exhibits a biexponential decline. Formulation Etomidate is usually presented as a clear colourless solution for injection containing 2 mg/ml of etomidate in an aqueous solution of 35% propylene glycol, although a lipid emulsion preparation (of equivalent strength) has also been introduced. Etomidate was originally formulated as a racemic mixture, but the R form is substantially more active than its enantiomer. It was later reformulated as a single-enantiomer drug, becoming the first general anesthetic in that class to be used clinically. References Citations Sources ; discussion 67. ; author reply 809.

Document 15 (Title: Oxamniquine): Oxamniquine is not recommended during pregnancy. Pharmacokinetics Peak plasma concentrations are achieved one to three hours after a dose, and the plasma half-life is 1.0 to 2.5 hours. It is extensively metabolised to inactive metabolites, principally the 6-carboxy derivative, which are excreted in the urine. About 70% of a dose of oxamniquine is excreted as the 6-carboxy metabolite within 12 hours of a dose; traces of the 2-carboxy metabolite have also been detected in the urine. Mechanism of action It is an anthelmintic with schistosomicidal activity against Schistosoma mansoni, but not against other Schistosoma spp. Oxamniquine is a potent single-dose agent for treatment of S. mansoni infection, and it causes worms to shift from the mesenteric veins to the liver, where the male worms are retained; the female worms return to the mesentery, but can no longer release eggs.
