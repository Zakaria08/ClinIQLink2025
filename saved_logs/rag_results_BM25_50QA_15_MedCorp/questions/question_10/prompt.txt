With your own knowledge and the help of the following document:

Document 1 (Title: Alice in Wonderland syndrome): Causes Because Alice in Wonderland syndrome is not commonly diagnosed and documented, it is difficult to estimate what the main causes are, if there are any. The cause of over half of the documented cases of Alice in Wonderland syndrome is unknown. Complete and partial forms of the Alice in Wonderland syndrome exist in a range of other disorders, including epilepsy, intoxicants, infectious states, fevers, and brain lesions. Furthermore, the syndrome is commonly associated with migraines, as well as the use of psychoactive drugs. It can also be the initial symptom of the Epstein–Barr virus (see mononucleosis), and a relationship between the syndrome and mononucleosis has been suggested. Within this suggested relationship, Epstein–Barr virus appears to be the most common cause in children, while for adults it is more commonly associated with migraines.
Document 2 (Title: Human betaherpesvirus 5): Immunocompetent adults CMV infections can still be of clinical significance in adult immunocompetent populations. CMV mononucleosis (some sources reserve "mononucleosis" for Epstein–Barr virus only). However, the mononucleosis syndrome associated with CMV typically lacks signs of enlarged cervical lymph nodes and splenomegaly. CMV has also been associated with Guillain–Barré syndrome, type 1 diabetes, and type 2 diabetes. The question of whether latent CMV infection has any negative effects on people who are otherwise healthy has been debated; as of 2016 the answer was not clear, but discussions had focused on whether latent CMV might increase the risk of some cardiovascular diseases and cancers. Pathogenesis
Document 3 (Title: Interleukin 15): Disease Epstein-Barr virus In humans with history of acute infectious mononucleosis (the syndrome associated with primary Epstein–Barr virus infection), IL-15R expressing lymphocytes are not detected even 14 years after infection. Celiac disease There have been recent studies suggesting that suppression of IL-15 may be a potential treatment for celiac disease and even presents the possibility of preventing its development. In one study with mice blocking IL-15 with an antibody led to the reversal of autoimmune intestinal damage. In another study mice used were able to eat gluten without developing symptoms. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease A recent report indicated IL-15 promotes non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Immunotherapy Metastatic cancer
Document 4 (Title: Infectious mononucleosis): Prognosis Serious complications are uncommon, occurring in less than 5% of cases: CNS complications include meningitis, encephalitis, hemiplegia, Guillain–Barré syndrome, and transverse myelitis. Prior infectious mononucleosis has been linked to the development of multiple sclerosis. Hematologic: Hemolytic anemia (direct Coombs test is positive) and various cytopenias, and bleeding (caused by thrombocytopenia) can occur. Mild jaundice Hepatitis with the Epstein–Barr virus is rare. Upper airway obstruction from tonsillar hypertrophy is rare. Fulminant disease course of immunocompromised people are rare. Splenic rupture is rare. Myocarditis and pericarditis are rare. Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome Chronic fatigue syndrome Cancers associated with the Epstein-Barr virus include: Burkitt's lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma and lymphomas in general as well as nasopharyngeal and gastric carcinoma. Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis
Document 5 (Title: Transfusion-associated cytomegalovirus mononucleosis.): Transfusion-associated cytomegalovirus mononucleosis is generally considered only as a complication of extracorporeal circulation following cardiac surgery. Three cases following trauma were recognized in less than one year. Both massive and limited volume blood transfusions were involved. Hectic fever was a characteristic feature in these otherwise remarkably asymptomatic individuals, without the classic features of heterophile-positive infectious mononucleosis. Since the illness developed several weeks into the post-operative period after extensive thoracic or abdominal trauma surgery, the presence of an undrained abscess was naturally the major diagnostic concern. Atypical lymphocytosis, markers of altered immunity (cold agglutinins, rheumatoid factor) and moderate hepatic dysfunction were important laboratory clues. In one case, focal isotope defects in the spleen scan misleadingly suggested a septic complication. A false-positive monospot test initially obscured the correct serologic diagnosis in the same patient. Failure to consider this selflimited viral infection may be a critical factor leading to unnecessary surgery. Other viral agents capable of eliciting a similar syndrome are cited.
Document 6 (Title: Macropsia): Patients with both Epstein-Barr virus and infectious mononucleosis have cited an increase in the sizes of perceived objects, coinciding with other symptoms of Alice in Wonderland Syndrome. Additionally, it has been observed that Epstein-Barr patients who cite hallucinations display abnormal MRI scans. The MRI may show swelling of the cerebral cortex, transient T2 prolongation, and transient lesions. Unlike in MRI's, no abnormalities have been reported in CT scans. It is thus recommended that an Epstein-Barr patient who cites visual hallucinations have an MRI scan. Macropsia may appear either before the onset, or after the resolution, of all clinical symptoms associated with the illness. The duration of the disturbances have been shown to range between two weeks and seven months. Almost all patients with macropsia due to infectious mononucleosis make full recoveries. Patients with Coxsackievirus B1 have reported numerous symptoms of Alice in Wonderland Syndrome, the most common of

Document 8 (Title: Menstrual cup): One case report noted the development of endometriosis and adenomyosis in one menstrual cup user. Additionally, one survey with a small sample size indicated a possible link. Therefore, two organizations have issued a combined statement that urged further research. However, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration declined to remove menstrual cups from the market, saying that there was insufficient evidence of risk. A 2011 randomized controlled trial measured urovaginal infection in a comparison of menstrual cup and tampon use, and found no difference. No differences in the growth of Staphylococcus aureus or health harms were identified among school girls provided with menstrual cups compared to those using menstrual pads, or continuing their usual practice in rural western Kenya. Menstrual cups can be used with an IUD; however, there is an unclear association with respect to IUD expulsion. Toxic shock syndrome
Document 9 (Title: Streptococcal pharyngitis): Differential diagnosis As the symptoms of streptococcal pharyngitis overlap with other conditions, it can be difficult to make the diagnosis clinically. Coughing, nasal discharge, diarrhea, and red, irritated eyes in addition to fever and sore throat are more indicative of a viral sore throat than of strep throat. The presence of marked lymph node enlargement along with sore throat, fever, and tonsillar enlargement may also occur in infectious mononucleosis. Other conditions that may present similarly include epiglottitis, Kawasaki disease, acute retroviral syndrome, Lemierre's syndrome, Ludwig's angina, peritonsillar abscess, and retropharyngeal abscess.
Document 10 (Title: Lethal white syndrome): The long-standing practice of categorizing Paint horses in this manner contributed to the incorporation of the word "overo" into some of the titles used to describe the disease, such as overo lethal white foal syndrome. However, "overo" refers to several genetically unrelated white-spotting patterns, and only the frame pattern is indicative of the syndrome. The confusion about the nature of LWS is then furthered by statements such as "there are many overos that do not carry the lethal allele", which is technically correct, but only because the term "overo" also encompasses splash and sabino patterns, as well as frame. Homozygotes Homozygotes for the Ile118Lys mutation on the equine endothelin receptor type B gene have lethal white syndrome. In any crossing of two carrier parents, the statistical probability of producing a solid-colored, living foal is 25%; a 50% chance exists for a frame-patterned, living foal; and a 25% chance exists of a LWS foal.
Document 11 (Title: Claustrum): High frequency stimulation (HFS) in cat claustrum(s) has the capability to induce autonomic changes and induce “inactivation syndrome”. This syndrome is described as a decrease in awareness, indicating the relationship between the claustrum and consciousness. In humans this same effect can be observed. Stimulation of the left claustrum in humans has produced 'a complete arrest of volitional behavior, unresponsiveness, and amnesia without negative motor symptoms or mere aphasia' suggesting the involvement in consciousness. Furthermore, MRI studies have shown that increased signal intensity within the claustrum has been associated with status epilepticus – a condition in which epileptic seizures follow one another without recovery of consciousness in-between events. As well, increased signal intensity is associated with Focal dyscognitive seizures, which are seizures that elicit impairment of awareness or consciousness without convulsions. The individual becomes unaware of his or her
Document 12 (Title: Epstein Barr virus-specific immune defects in patients with persistent symptoms following infectious mononucleosis.): In a number of patients recovery from infectious mononucleosis (IM) following primary Epstein Barr virus (EBV) infection, is complicated by the persistence of symptoms for months or years. Normally recovery from infectious mononucleosis is associated with the development of EBV-specific antibodies and memory cytotoxic T-cells, which are present in the peripheral blood of all normal seropositive individuals. We studied four patients who had persistent symptoms for more than two years after infectious mononucleosis to determine if this abnormality was associated with a defect in EBV-specific or non-specific immune responses. All four patients had normal immunoglobulin concentrations, T- and B-cell numbers, T-cell proliferative responses and natural killer cell activity. However three of the four had reduced or absent antibodies to the EBV nuclear antigen (EBNA) although other EBV-specific antibody titres were normal. All four also had reduced EBV-specific cytotoxic T-cell activity as measured by the EBV regression assay. This defect was probably EBV-specific as alloreactive cytotoxic T-cell responses were normal. In addition, three of three patients tested had reduced in vitro antibody synthesis following pokeweed mitogen stimulation. These studies indicate that the syndrome of persistent symptoms following EBV mononucleosis may be associated with a defect in EBV-specific immunity, and thus suggest a possible immunological basis for the syndrome.
Document 13 (Title: Epstein–Barr virus): It is best known as the cause of infectious mononucleosis ("mono" or "glandular fever"). It is also associated with various non-malignant, premalignant, and malignant Epstein–Barr virus-associated lymphoproliferative diseases such as Burkitt lymphoma, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, and Hodgkin's lymphoma; non-lymphoid malignancies such as gastric cancer and nasopharyngeal carcinoma; and conditions associated with human immunodeficiency virus such as hairy leukoplakia and central nervous system lymphomas. The virus is also associated with the childhood disorders of Alice in Wonderland syndrome and acute cerebellar ataxia and, based on some evidence, higher risks of developing certain autoimmune diseases, especially dermatomyositis, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, Sjögren's syndrome, and multiple sclerosis. About 200,000 cancer cases globally per year are thought to be attributable to EBV.
Document 14 (Title: Breast augmentation): Non-implant breast augmentation Non-implant breast augmentation with injections of autologous fat grafts (adipocyte tissue) is indicated for women requiring breast reconstruction, defect correction, and the æsthetic enhancement of the bust. breast reconstruction: post-mastectomy re-creation of the breast(s); trauma-damaged tissues (blunt, penetrating), disease (breast cancer), and explantation deformity (empty breast-implant socket). congenital defect correction: micromastia, tuberous breast deformity, Poland's syndrome, etc. primary augmentation: the aesthetic enhancement (contouring) of the size, form, and feel of the breasts. The operating room time of breast reconstruction, congenital defect correction, and primary breast augmentation procedures is determined by the indications to be treated.
Document 15 (Title: BASIC-PLUS): The "virtual DIM" statement could map "virtual data array(s)" or "virtual array(s)" to a disk file, which allowed arrays larger than the computer's available memory (or even its address space), and allowed use of array elements to read, write, and extend disk files (persistent storage). They called this arrangement "virtual data storage" and "virtual core", but it did not use the modern approach of allocating the arrays and a memory-mapped file in the same virtual memory and then allowing the virtual memory manager to handle all access via paging. Instead, a program would first execute the statement, which opened a file with an associated file number and assigned it one one-record (512-byte) file buffer. Next, the statement would associate the data area of that file with one or more arrays that could be "used" the same as any memory-based array. Upon each access to a virtual array element, BASIC-PLUS would calculate which record of the file contained the datum. If the correct
