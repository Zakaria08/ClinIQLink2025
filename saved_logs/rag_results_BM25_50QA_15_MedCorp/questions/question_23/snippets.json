The incidence of wound complications was 29 per cent with obesity, seven times that in patients of normal weight, and all types of wound disorders, except evisceration, occurred more frequently in obese patients. Among identifiable factors potentially responsible for wound infection were an increased incidence of diabetes, longer operating time and greater blood loss in overweight patients.
