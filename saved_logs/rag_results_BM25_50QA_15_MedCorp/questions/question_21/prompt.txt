Document 1 (Title: Hydronephrosis): The most common causes of hydronephrosis in children are anatomical abnormalities. These include vesicoureteral reflux, urethral stricture, and stenosis. The most common cause of hydronephrosis in young adults is kidney stones. In older adults, the most common cause of hydronephrosis is benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH), or intrapelvic neoplasms such as prostate cancer. Compression of one or both ureters can also be caused by other developmental defects not completely occurring during the fetal stage such as an abnormally placed vein, artery, or tumor. Bilateral compression of the ureters can occur during pregnancy due to enlargement of the uterus. Changes in hormone levels during this time may also affect the muscle contractions of the bladder, further complicating this condition. Sources of obstruction that can arise from other various causes include kidney stones, blood clots or retroperitoneal fibrosis.

Document 3 (Title: Chronic kidney disease): By anatomical location Vascular disease includes large vessel disease such as bilateral kidney artery stenosis and small vessel disease such as ischemic nephropathy, hemolytic-uremic syndrome, and vasculitis. Glomerular disease comprises a diverse group and is classified into: Primary glomerular disease such as focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and IgA nephropathy (or nephritis) Secondary glomerular disease such as diabetic nephropathy and lupus nephritis Tubulointerstitial disease includes drug- and toxin-induced chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis, and reflux nephropathy. Obstructive nephropathy, as exemplified by bilateral kidney stones and benign prostatic hyperplasia of the prostate gland. Rarely, pinworms infecting the kidney can cause obstructive nephropathy.
Document 4 (Title: Hydronephrosis): Prognosis The prognosis of hydronephrosis is extremely variable and depends on the condition leading to hydronephrosis, whether one (unilateral) or both (bilateral) kidneys are affected, the pre-existing kidney function, the duration of hydronephrosis (acute or chronic), and whether hydronephrosis occurred in developing or mature kidneys. Permanent kidney damage can occur from prolonged hydronephrosis secondary to compression of kidney tissue and ischemia. For example, unilateral hydronephrosis caused by an obstructing stone will likely resolve when the stone passes, and the likelihood of recovery is excellent. Alternately, severe bilateral prenatal hydronephrosis (such as occurs with posterior urethral valves) will likely carry a poor long-term prognosis, because obstruction while the kidneys are developing causes permanent kidney damage even if the obstruction is relieved postnatal. Hydronephrosis can be a cause of pyonephrosis, which is a urological emergency. References
Document 5 (Title: Dysuria): Urinary tract One of the most common causes of dysuria is urinary tract infection. Urinary tract infections are more common in females than males due to female anatomy, having a shorter and straight urethra compared to males who have a longer and curved urethra due to male anatomy. In females, bacteria can reach the bladder more easily due to shorter and straight urethra as they have less distance to travel. Because of these reasons, females tend to experience dysuria more frequently compared to males. Also, most urinary tract infections are uncomplicated. Chlamydia Cystitis Hemorrhagic cystitis Kidney stones Malignancy, i.e., bladder cancer, prostatic cancer, or urethral cancer Prostatic enlargement, i.e., benign prostatic hyperplasia (male), prostatic cancer Prostatitis (male) Pyelonephritis Sexually transmitted disease Trichomoniasis Urethral stricture Urethritis Urinary schistosomiasis Urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by bacterial infection
Document 6 (Title: Acute kidney injury): Intrinsic or renal Intrinsic AKI refers to disease processes which directly damage the kidney itself. Intrinsic AKI can be due to one or more of the kidney's structures including the glomeruli, kidney tubules, or the interstitium. Common causes of each are glomerulonephritis, acute tubular necrosis (ATN), and acute interstitial nephritis (AIN), respectively. Other causes of intrinsic AKI are rhabdomyolysis and tumor lysis syndrome. Certain medication classes such as calcineurin inhibitors (e.g., tacrolimus) can also directly damage the tubular cells of the kidney and result in a form of intrinsic AKI. Postrenal Postrenal AKI refers to acute kidney injury caused by disease states downstream of the kidney and most often occurs as a consequence of urinary tract obstruction. This may be related to benign prostatic hyperplasia, kidney stones, obstructed urinary catheter, bladder stones, or cancer of the bladder, ureters, or prostate. Diagnosis
Document 7 (Title: Benign prostatic hyperplasia): The differential diagnosis for LUTS is broad and includes various medical conditions, neurologic disorders, and other diseases of the bladder, urethra, and prostate such as bladder cancer, urinary tract infection, urethral stricture, urethral calculi (stones), chronic prostatitis, and prostate cancer. Neurogenic bladder can cause urinary retention and cause symptoms similar to those of BPH. This may occur as a result of uncoordinated contraction of the bladder muscle or impairment in the timing of bladder muscle contraction and urethral sphincter relaxation. Notable causes of neurogenic bladder include disorders of the central nervous system such as Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and spinal cord injuries as well as disorders of the peripheral nervous system such as diabetes mellitus, vitamin B12 deficiency, and alcohol-induced nerve damage. Individuals affected by heart failure often experience nighttime awakenings to urinate due to redistribution of fluid accumulated in
Document 8 (Title: Rectal examination): Usage This examination may be used for the diagnosis of prostatic disorders, benign prostatic hyperplasia and the four types of prostatitis. Chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome, chronic bacterial prostatitis, acute (sudden) bacterial prostatitis, and asymptomatic inflammatory prostatitis. The DRE has a 50% specificity for benign prostatic hyperplasia. Vigorous examination of the prostate in suspected acute prostatitis can lead to seeding of septic emboli and should never be done. Its utility as a screening method for prostate cancer however is not supported by the evidence; for the evaluation of certain clinical symptoms: a male with change in urinary ability, impotence, or dysuria (blood in the urine), pain with bowel movements;
Document 9 (Title: Pyelonephritis): Chronic pyelonephritis Chronic pyelonephritis implies recurrent kidney infections and can result in scarring of the renal parenchyma and impaired function, especially in the setting of obstruction. A perinephric abscess (infection around the kidney) and/or pyonephrosis may develop in severe cases of pyelonephritis.
Document 10 (Title: Hematuria): Polycystic kidney disease Idiopathic hematuria Non-glomerular hematuria Visible blood clots in the urine indicate a non-glomerular cause. Non-glomerular causes include: Urinary tract infections, such as pyelonephritis, cystitis, prostatitis, and urethritis Kidney stones Cancers, such as renal cell carcinoma and bladder cancer, and in men, prostate cancer Urinary tract strictures Benign prostatic hyperplasia Renal papillary necrosis Trauma or damage to the lining of the urinary tract Intense exercise Increased tendency to bleed due to acquired or genetic conditions (e.g. sickle cell disease or vitamin K deficiency bleeding) or certain medications (e.g. blood thinners) Mimickers of hematuria Pigmenturia Not all red or brown urine is caused by hematuria. Other substances such as certain medications and certain foods can cause urine to appear red. Medications that may cause urine to appear red include: Phenazopyridine Nitrofurantoin Doxorubicin Rifampicin
Document 11 (Title: Hydronephrosis): Pathophysiology Hydronephrosis is caused by obstruction of urine before the renal pelvis. The obstruction causes dilation of the nephron tubules and flattening of the lining of the tubules within the kidneys which in turn causes swelling of the renal calyces. Hydronephrosis can either be acute or chronic. In acute hydronephrosis full recovery of kidney function is seen. However, with chronic hydronephrosis, permanent loss of kidney function is seen even once obstruction is removed. Obstruction that occurs anywhere along the upper urinary tract will lead to increased pressure within the structures of the kidney due to the inability to pass urine from the kidney to the bladder. Common causes of upper tract obstruction include obstructing stones and ureteropelvic junction (UPJ) obstruction caused by intrinsic narrowing of the ureters or an overlying vessel.
Document 12 (Title: Prostatectomy): Medical uses Benign Indications for removal of the prostate in a benign setting include acute urinary retention, recurrent urinary tract infections, uncontrollable hematuria, bladder stones secondary to bladder outlet obstruction, significant symptoms from bladder outlet obstruction that are refractory to medical or minimally invasive therapy, and chronic kidney disease secondary to chronic bladder outlet obstruction.
Document 13 (Title: Benign prostatic hyperplasia): Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), also called prostate enlargement, is a noncancerous increase in size of the prostate gland. Symptoms may include frequent urination, trouble starting to urinate, weak stream, inability to urinate, or loss of bladder control. Complications can include urinary tract infections, bladder stones, and chronic kidney problems. The cause is unclear. Risk factors include a family history, obesity, type 2 diabetes, not enough exercise, and erectile dysfunction. Medications like pseudoephedrine, anticholinergics, and calcium channel blockers may worsen symptoms. The underlying mechanism involves the prostate pressing on the urethra thereby making it difficult to pass urine out of the bladder. Diagnosis is typically based on symptoms and examination after ruling out other possible causes.
Document 14 (Title: Hematuria): Hematuria in children Common causes of hematuria in children are: Fever Strenuous exercise Acute nephritis Congenital abnormalities: Non-vascular: ureteropelvic junction obstruction, posterior urethral valves, urethral prolapse, urethral diverticula, multicystic dysplastic kidney Vascular: arteriovenous malformations, hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasias, renal vascular thromboses. Urinary stones. Coagulation disorders. Mechanical trauma: masturbation, foreign body. Nephritic Syndrome: IgA nephropathy, Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, Benign familial hematuria, Alport syndrome. Sickle cell trait or disease.
Document 15 (Title: Adrenergic receptor): Actions of the α1 receptor mainly involve smooth muscle contraction. It causes vasoconstriction in many blood vessels, including those of the skin, gastrointestinal system, kidney (renal artery) and brain. Other areas of smooth muscle contraction are: ureter vas deferens hair (arrector pili muscles) uterus (when pregnant) urethral sphincter urothelium and lamina propria bronchioles (although minor relative to the relaxing effect of β2 receptor on bronchioles) blood vessels of ciliary body (stimulation causes mydriasis) Actions also include glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis from adipose tissue and liver; secretion from sweat glands and Na+ reabsorption from kidney. α1 antagonists can be used to treat: hypertension – decrease blood pressure by decreasing peripheral vasoconstriction benign prostate hyperplasia – relax smooth muscles within the prostate thus easing urination α2 receptor
