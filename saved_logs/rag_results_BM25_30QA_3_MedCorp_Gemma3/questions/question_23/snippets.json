        "content": "Overall, bariatric surgery is safe and effective in evaluating and treating obese patients, particularly severely obese patients. As discussed above, multiple surgical interventions can provide adequate results. Still, each option has technical and metabolic issues that should be considered when determining a weight-loss surgery for each patient. A patient should undergo an extensive preoperative assessment, and a postoperative plan, which includes a discussion with the multi-disciplinary team, should also be completed. The surgery with all associated risks, benefits, and alternatives to surgery should be discussed. Given the extent of the risk-to-benefit ratio, which favors surgical intervention in severely obese patients, bariatric surgery can be a viable option for substantial and long-term weight loss as well as comorbidity control.",

With that being said, all patients are placed on an aggressive VTE prevention regimen following surgical intervention.
