Based on the following information:

Document 1 (Title: Carotid Endarterectomy -- Anatomy and Physiology): Within the superior mediastinum, the arch of the aorta can be found at the level of the sternal angle. Three large vessels originate from the aorta: the brachiocephalic trunk, the left common carotid artery, and the left subclavian artery.  On the right side, the common carotid artery arises as the first branch of the brachiocephalic trunk. Both the left and right common carotids bifurcate into an internal and external carotid artery, classically in the neck at the level of the fourth cervical vertebra (C4), near the superior border of the thyroid cartilage. The deep cervical fascia forms the carotid sheath, surrounding the carotid arteries, internal jugular veins, and vagus nerves. They are found medially to the sternocleidomastoid muscle. The internal carotid artery will continue into the skull to form part of the Circle of Willis and supply blood to the brain and eyes. Branches of the external carotid artery supply blood to the neck and face.
Document 2 (Title: Neuroanatomy, Middle Cerebral Artery -- Clinical Significance -- Embolism of the MCA): An embolism is a detached mass, typically a dislodged thrombus, gas, or fat, which is transported through the blood vessels until it is lodged in the MCA. The arterial occlusion impedes perfusion of oxygenated blood to the brain parenchyma, resulting in an ischemic stroke causing cerebral edema and brain parenchyma tissue necrosis. As a general rule, a proximal occlusion will cause damage to a large surface area and be devastating. In contrast, a distal occlusion will cause damage to a small surface area, resulting in a less severe clinical presentation. Thrombus formation commonly is associated with sites proximal to the MCA, such as internal carotid plaques, common carotid plaques, and atrial fibrillation, resulting in thrombus formation and embolism. Furthermore, it is worth noting that cardiac defects such as atrial septal and ventral septal defects may result in a paradoxical embolism. This subtype is denoted as such because the thrombus being transported through the superior or inferior vena cava bypasses the respiratory circulation through the cardiac defects and potentially result in an MCA embolism.
Document 3 (Title: Neuroanatomy, Optic Chiasm -- Blood Supply and Lymphatics): The circle of Willis, otherwise known as the cerebral arterial circle, encircles the optic chiasm. It is composed of anastomoses of blood vessels that communicate the anterior and posterior blood supply of the brain. The following vessels comprise the circle of Willis: The left and right anterior cerebral arteries are connected through the anterior communicating artery. The left and right internal carotid arteries The left and right posterior cerebral arteries The left and right posterior communicating arteries, which connect the left and right internal carotid arteries to the left and right posterior cerebral arteries, respectively

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
