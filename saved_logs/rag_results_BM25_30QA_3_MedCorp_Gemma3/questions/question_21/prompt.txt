Based on the following information:

Document 1 (Title: Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia -- Introduction): The development of BPH is characterized by stromal and epithelial cell proliferation in the prostate transition zone, which surrounds the urethra. This leads to urethral compression and bladder outflow obstruction, which can result in clinical manifestations of LUTS, urinary retention, or infections due to incomplete bladder emptying. [5] Long-term, untreated disease can lead to the development of chronic high-pressure retention (a potentially life-threatening condition) and long-term or permanent changes to the bladder detrusor muscle.
Document 2 (Title: Bladder Post Void Residual Volume -- Clinical Significance -- Obstruction): One researcher found that 9.5% of admitted patients to a geriatric unit with acute kidney injury had a pre-existing renal disease caused by obstructive uropathy. [41] Bladder outlet obstruction, namely benign prostatic hyperplasia, leads to profound changes and permanent damage to bladder structure and function, which may be irreversible. [42]
Document 3 (Title: Urethral Strictures -- History and Physical): A key difference between benign prostatic hyperplasia and urethral stricture disease is obstructed ejaculation. [8] In addition, patients with urethral strictures do not respond to typical benign prostatic hyperplasia therapy, such as alpha-blocker medications, and the weak urinary stream is relatively constant without much variation.
