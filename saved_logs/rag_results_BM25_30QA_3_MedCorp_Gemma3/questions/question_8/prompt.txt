Based on the following information:

Document 1 (Title: Chromatography -- Introduction -- Column Chromatography): This is the most commonly used type, where a column of fiberglass or steel filled with silica particles acts as a stationary phase. [1] The mobile phase is gas or liquid. In normal-phase column chromatography, a polar stationary phase separates non-polar compounds; in reversed-phase chromatography, the nonpolar stationary phase and the polar mobile phase are used. [7]
Document 2 (Title: Mass Spectrometer -- Specimen Requirements and Procedure -- Liquid Chromatography): Liquid chromatography separates samples based on interactions with the mobile and stationary phases, often depending on polarity. If a component's polarity differs from that of the mobile phase, it migrates more quickly through the chromatography column. The sample is separated into bands of individual components that can be further analyzed in mass spectrometry. [18] Other techniques used for sample preparation include electrospray ionization, which uses high voltages to separate components, and fast atom bombardment, which uses a beam to generate ions from a solid phase. [19] [20] The types of samples that can be analyzed within mass spectrometry include proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, and fatty acids. [21]
Document 3 (Title: Chromatography -- Introduction -- Stationary Phase): The stationary phase is a crucial component of chromatography that interacts with analytes as they pass through, leading to separation. Solid, liquid, or gas can be held over a supporting medium. The stationary phase interacts with various mixture components based on the polarity, affinity, size, and charge. Thus, different analytes have varying degrees of interaction with the stationary phase, leading to differential retention times and elution profiles. [1] Different types of chromatography use combinations of stationary and mobile phases to achieve separation. Refer to image 1 for the classification of chromatography.
