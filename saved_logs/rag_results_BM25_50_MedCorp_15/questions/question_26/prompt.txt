Document 1 (Title: Scrub typhus: an imported Rickettsial disease.): A case of scrub typhus due to Rickettsia tsutsugamushi is reported. This imported rickettsial disease was contracted by a 30-year-old woman while traveling in Thailand, and was transmitted by an infected mite's bite. Diagnosis was confirmed by specific serology and resolution was obtained by tetracycline therapy. Current concepts of the disease are reviewed.
Document 2 (Title: Chigger mites of the genus Leptotrombidium: key to species and their distribution in China.): Chigger mites of the genus Leptotrombidium (Acari: Trombiculidae) transmit scrub typhus, caused by Rickettsia tsutsugamushi (= R.orientalis) in South-East Asia. In China, eighty-two species of Leptotrombidium have been recorded; these are listed with the names of Provinces where they were found. Five species, L.deliense, L.insularae, L.kaohuense, L.rubellum and L.scutellare, have been implicated as Chinese vectors of scrub typhus. A brief key is given to the larvae of all but three of the Leptotrombidium mites known in China.
Document 3 (Title: Rickettsia): Rickettsia species are transmitted by numerous types of arthropod, including chigger, ticks, fleas, and lice, and are associated with both human and plant diseases. Most notably, Rickettsia species are the pathogens responsible for typhus, rickettsialpox, boutonneuse fever, African tick-bite fever, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, Flinders Island spotted fever, and Queensland tick typhus (Australian tick typhus). The majority of Rickettsia bacteria are susceptible to antibiotics of the tetracycline group. Classification The classification of Rickettsia into three groups (spotted fever, typhus, and scrub typhus) was initially based on serology. This grouping has since been confirmed by DNA sequencing. All three of these groups include human pathogens. The scrub typhus group has been reclassified as a related new genus, Orientia, but they still are in the order Rickettsiales and accordingly still are grouped with the rest of the rickettsial diseases.
Document 4 (Title: [Epidemiology of scrub typhus in Matsu Peikang Island].): A retrospective survey of the epidemiology of scrub typhus in 1990 in Matsu Peikang Island was made at the end of December of 1990. The diagnosis of scrub typhus was based on the presence of escar, typical clinical manifestation and good response to tetracycline treatment. There were 89 cases of scrub typhus studied, and except for one civilian, the other 88 cases were military personnel, occurring in 2.2% of the total military personnel on the island. However it occurred in 0.08% of the civilian population. Seasonal distribution of scrub typhus was limited to between June and October of 1990. The peak incidence occurred in July. Scrub typhus was distributed over the whole island. A higher incidence of scrub typhus occurred in soldiers and sergeants than in officers. A significant different incidence was found in different units. No fatalities were reported. Different units. No fatalities were reported. Different military activities, duties and the location of the military unit may affect the incidence of scrub typhus. The scrub typhus epidemic was also related to temperature.
Document 5 (Title: Scrub typhus): Signs and symptoms Signs and symptoms include fever, headache, muscle pain, cough, and gastrointestinal symptoms. More virulent strains of O. tsutsugamushi can cause hemorrhaging and intravascular coagulation. Morbilliform rash, eschar, splenomegaly, and lymphadenopathies are typical signs. Leukopenia and abnormal liver function tests are commonly seen in the early phase of the illness. Pneumonitis, encephalitis, and myocarditis occur in the late phase of illness. It has particularly been shown to be the most common cause of acute encephalitis syndrome in Bihar, India. Causes Scrub typhus is transmitted by some species of trombiculid mites ("chiggers", particularly Leptotrombidium deliense), which are found in areas of heavy scrub vegetation. The mites feed on infected rodent hosts and subsequently transmit the parasite to other rodents and humans. The bite of this mite leaves a characteristic black eschar that is useful to the doctor for making the diagnosis.
Document 6 (Title: Sensitive microplate enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for detection of antibodies against the scrub typhus rickettsia, Rickettsia tsutsugamushi.): A microtiter enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) has been developed for the titration of antibodies against scrub typhus in human and animal sera. Scrub typhus rickettsiae were grown in monolayers of irradiated mouse LM3 cells and separated from host cell materials by differential centrifugation, filtration through a glass filter (AP-20, Millipore Corp.), and isopycnic banding in Renografin density gradients. The scrub typhus ELISA antigens were obtained from the purified viable rickettsiae by French pressure cell disruption and addition of 0.2% Formalin to the soluble extract. Antisera prepared in rabbits against the prototype Karp, the Kato, and the Gilliam strains of scrub typhus were used to standardize the ELISA and to compare its sensitivity and specificity to that of the indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFA). ELISA titers were measured as the greatest serum dilution showing an optical density 0.25 above controls or by the optical density achieved at a fixed serum dilution. The IFA and ELISA end point titers were quite similar, and all three measures of titer had comparable specificity for the strains of scrub typhus. No cross-reactions between the typhus and scrub typhus wera were observed by ELISA. Both the immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG antibody titers of 12 sequential sera from four patients with scrub typhus were obtained by IFA and ELISA. The IFA and ELISA end point titers for IgM and IgG had correlation coefficients of 0.91 and 0.97, respectively, whereas the ELISA optical density values at a serum dilution of 1:100 had slightly lower correlations with IFA titers (0.80 and 0.94). Early rising IgM titers followed by rising IgG titers were demonstrated by ELISA in three patients with primary scrub typhus infections, whereas the IgG response predominated in a patient with a reinfection. It is concluded that the ELISA for scrub typhus is a very satisfactory alternative to the IFA test.
Document 7 (Title: Scrub typhus in Hong Kong.): A retrospective analysis of cases of scrub typhus in military personnel in Hong Kong during the years 1979-1989 is presented. Fifty-nine cases were identified, most occurring during the hot humid season between May and October. Few civilian cases of scrub typhus are notified to the Hong Kong Medical and Health Department and possible reasons for the disparity in case numbers between military and civilian personnel are discussed. Reports from other areas of South-east Asia have documented a previously unrecognized high incidence of scrub typhus in the indigenous population. It is suggested that a prospective study utilizing specific serological diagnostic techniques would be of value in assessing the importance of scrub typhus as a cause of 'fever of undetermined origin' in the civilian population of Hong Kong.
Document 8 (Title: [Scrub typhus--one case report].): Scrub typhus (tsutsugamushi disease) is an acute infectious disease caused by Rickettsia tsutsugamushi transmitted through the bite of larvae of certain trombiculid mites. Geographical distribution in Asian-Pacific region is much of the roughly triangular area bounded by Japan, Pakistan and Australia. It is an endemic illness in the Pescadores Islands, but has scarcely been reported in central Taiwan. An eleven-year-old boy was admitted to Changhua Christian Hospital with the chief complaints of fever, lethargy and skin rash for seven days. On physical examination, he was found to have painless eschar, conjunctivitis, meningoencephalitis, pneumonitis, ascites, jaundice, hepatomegaly, liver function impairment and thrombocytopenia. His Proteus OX-K agglutinin titer increased from 1:160 in the acute sera to 1:640 in the convalescent sera. A greater than four-fold rise (greater than 1:640) in antibody titers to Karp, Gilliam, Kato strains of R. tsutsugamushi between acute and convalescent sera were demonstrated by immunofluorescent antibody. The patient was treated with minocycline and chloramphenicol and was completely recovered.
Document 9 (Title: Rickettsia tsutsugamushi infection and scrub typhus incidence among Chinese military personnel in the Pescadores Islands.): Personnel assigned to infantry units of the army of the Republic of China (Taiwan) stationed in the Pescadores Islands experienced the highest incidence rate of scrub typhus (4%) and the highest rate of Rickettsia tsutsugamushi infection (12%) of the units studied during 1976. The ratio of scrub typhus to infection with R. tsutsugamushi was 30%. Non-immune personnel, when infected, were more likely to develop scrub typhus than were those who had previously been infected. There was a correlation between clinical illness and high antibody titers developed in response to the infection.
Document 10 (Title: Vectors of scrub typhus and their hosts on a mature oil palm estate.): L. (L.) deliense was the predominant vector of scrub typhus in a mature oil palm estate, but a small number of L. (L.) fletcheri (0.1% from rodents) and L. (L.) vivericola (0.02% from rodents and 8.0% from black plates) was also collected. Although good correlation between L. (L.) deliense collected from rodents and from black plates was not established, either method may serve as a general indicator of population fluctuations over a period of time. For the most part, the vectors of scrub typhus were limited to litter piles, and thus, the possibility of contracting scrub typhus within this type of habitat was minimal.
Document 11 (Title: Epidemiological and serological study of scrub typhus among Chinese military in the Pescadores islands of Taiwan.): An outbreak of 69 cases of scrub typhus occurred among Chinese military personnel stationed in the Pescadores Islands, Taiwan Province, Republic of China between May and November 1975. A retrospective epidemiological study of this outbreak indicated that military personnel over 40 were more likely to have scrub typhus than those under 40. High risk groups included the Garrison Force (home guard), anti-aircraft gunners and infantry and armoured units stationed at Hsing-jen. The onset of symptoms in 69% occurred within one year of residence in the Pescadores. The clinical course of scrub typhus and the serological response to infection were also studied. Eschar formation, fever, headache chills and lymph node enlargement were the predominant clinical manifestations noted. The indirect immunofluorescent antibody test (IFAT) demonstrated diagnostic (four-fold) rises in antibody titres to Rickettsia tsutsugamushi reference strains in 36 of 41 paired sera tested. 11 of 19 patients from whom only single sera were obtained had IFA titres presumptive of scrub typhus (greater than or equal to 1:160). Of 19 patients experiencing possible primary infections, 13 (68%) responded with antibodies directed against more than one reference strain of R. tsutsugamushi. These results suggest that several antigenically diverse strains of R. tsutsugamushi may be active in the Pescadores.
Document 12 (Title: Plaque assay and cloning of scrub typhus rickettsiae in irradiated L-929 cells.): It was demonstrated that gamma-irradiated L-929 cells support plaque formation by three strains of Rickettsia tsutsugamushi and representative species of the spotted fever and typhus group rickettsiae. Sensitivity of the plaque assay for detection of viable scrub typhus rickettsiae was similar to that achieved with intraperitoneal inoculation of random-bred mice. The concentration of irradiated cells and the temperature and length of incubation were all found to affect plaque size. A technique combining terminal dilution and plaque purification was used to obtain clones of three strains of scrub typhus rickettsiae.
Document 13 (Title: Murine typhus identified as a major cause of febrile illness in a camp for displaced Khmers in Thailand.): Scrub and murine typhus have been identified as causes of illness among the 238,000 displaced Khmer people residing in temporary settlements on the Thai side of the Thai-Cambodian border. Still, the true extent of the problem and the relative frequency of infection with scrub typhus as compared to murine typhus are unknown. We evaluated consecutive patients with unexplained pyrexia (documented fever, no exclusionary diagnosis, and constitutional symptoms) in 1 temporary settlement over 1 month. Laboratory studies included culture of blood and assay of paired sera for rickettsial IgM and IgG antibody, for dengue IgM and IgG antibody, and for leptospiral IgM and IgG antibody. Among 37 patients (27 adults and 10 children), 28 (75%) had a rickettsiosis (26 cases of murine typhus and 2 cases of scrub typhus). No case of enteric fever, dengue, or leptospirosis was diagnosed. The illnesses of 9 patients were not identified. Signs and symptoms did not distinguish confirmed rickettsial infections from undiagnosed illnesses. The 1 month attack rate of rickettsial infection was 29/100,000 for children and 185/100,000 for adults. Murine typhus was a major cause of febrile illness in this settlement.
Document 14 (Title: Clinical observations of scrub typhus on Penghu (the Pescadores Islands).): Between May and September 1973, 68 cases of scrub typhus in Chinese military personnel on the Pescadores Islands were studied. The common symptoms and signs were fever, chills, headache, eschar, myalgia, and lymph node enlargement. Most eschars were located in the axilla, waist, groin and genitals, and neck. These lesions were painless and not noticed by the patients themselves. Regional lymph node enlargement at the site of eschar drainage was common. Relative bradycardia with fever was observed in 40%, a skin rash in 35% of the patients. Leucopenia was noted more frequently in the febrile than in the convalescent stage, but more than half of the patients had a normal count. Lymphocytosis was prominent, especially during the convalescent period. An acceleration of ESR was noted. Instead of depression of the erythroid series in the marrow which was reported previously, 47% of examined patients were found to have erythroid hyperplasia. Two patients showed marked hypocellularity of the marrow in the acute febrile stage; later on became normocellular. Albuminuria was present in 15 and BUN increased in 12 patients. Elevation of serum bilirubin and SGOT was also noted. Biologic false positive VDRL tests were observed in nine patients. In 30 tests elevation of Proteus OX-K titres between 1:160 and 1:640 was noted. A geometric mean OX-K titre rise in the patients is presented; the mean titre reached a peak in the third week of illness, and then fell off. Most of the patients were treated with tetracycline 500 mg every six hours for about nine days. The fever usually subsided within 36 hours. Complications or mortality were not encountered.
Document 15 (Title: Interferon-gamma in cerebrospinal fluid without pleocytosis in scrub typhus.): We detected immunoreactive interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) both in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and in serum of 5 patients with scrub typhus, one with meningitis and 4 other cases with neither CSF pleocytosis nor blood-CSF barrier dysfunction. Our data suggest intrathecal synthesis of IFN-gamma without pleocytosis which implies occult cerebral involvement in scrub typhus.
