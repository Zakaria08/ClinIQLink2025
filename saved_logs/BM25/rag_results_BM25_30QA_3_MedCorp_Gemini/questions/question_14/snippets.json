        "content": "Push enteroscopy is performed with a long endoscope similar in design to an upper endoscope. The enteroscope is pushed down the small bowel, sometimes with the help of a stiffening overtube that extends from the mouth to the small intestine. The proximal to mid-jejunum is usually reached, and the instrument channel of the endoscope allows for biopsy or endoscopic therapy. Deeper insertion into the small bowel can be accomplished by single-or double-balloon enteroscopy or spiral enteroscopy (Fig. 345-9). These instruments enable pleating of the small intestine onto an over-tube (see Video 346e-1). With balloon-assisted enteroscopy, the entire intestinal tract can be visualized in some patients when both the oral and anal routes of insertion are used. Biopsies and endoscopic therapy can be performed throughout the visualized small bowel (Fig. 345-10).",

        "content": "Push enteroscopy or double-balloon enteroscopy is a new advancement to standard endoscopes. They have been used when the lesion is farther down in the small bowel and not seen with the standard endoscopes. It uses two balloons, which can help the scope be pushed farther into the small bowel. [22] It is possible to see the lesions, as far as the ileum, depending upon the performer's expertise. The advantage is the ability to treat, take biopsies and mark the area with the tattoo. Studies have shown that the enteroscope has identified the bleeding source in about 74% of patients and treated about 60% to 70%. [23]",

Double-balloon enteroscopy also enables therapeutic interventions, such as polypectomy. These lesions may lead to several complications, such as bleeding, obstruction, and intussusception. The risk of colorectal, gastric, small bowel, and pancreatic cancers is elevated, [37] [38] with the incidence of cancer rising significantly after age 50.
