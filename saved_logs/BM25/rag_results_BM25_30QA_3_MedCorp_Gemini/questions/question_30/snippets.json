        "content": "The simplest way to assess intellectual abilities is through language skills. Language function is receptive (understanding speech or gestures) and expressive (speech and use of gestures). Abnormalities of language resulting from cerebral hemisphere disorders are referred to as aphasias. Anterior, expressive, or Broca aphasia is characterized by sparse, non-fluent language. Posterior, receptive, or Wernicke aphasia is characterized by an inability to understand language, with speech that is fluent but nonsensical. Global aphasia refers to impaired expressive and receptive language. The cranial nerve evaluation assesses brainstem integrity but depends on the stage of brain maturation and the ability to cooperate. A colorful toy may capture a young child\u2019s attention and permit observation of coordination, movement, and cranial nerve function.",
