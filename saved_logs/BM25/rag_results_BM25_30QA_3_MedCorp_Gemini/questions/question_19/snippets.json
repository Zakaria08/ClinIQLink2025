        "content": "Bone tissue is a dynamic structure that is continuously formed and resorbed in a balanced process. Osteoclasts, the cells responsible for bone resorption, express another acid phosphatase isoform. Indeed, several studies have shown that acid phosphatase is directly involved in bone resorption. Bone acid phosphatase differs from prostatic acid phosphatase in being a tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase. In osteoporosis, the most common bone disease in humans, the resorption/formation balance becomes disrupted in favor of resorption. Several serum markers for bone resorption have been proposed, such as urinary hydroxyproline, total urinary pyridinoline, and bone sialoprotein. Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase is precise, resistant to hemolysis, and shows minimal day-to-day variability, making it a potential marker for monitoring therapy response, though it is still under development. In addition, agents that inhibit tartrate-resistant acid phosphatases, such as fluoride, have been shown to improve and even reverse osteoporosis cases. [4] [5]",
