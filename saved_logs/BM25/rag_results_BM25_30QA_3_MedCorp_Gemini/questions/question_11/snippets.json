Cold urticaria is local at body areas exposed to low ambient temperature or cold objects but can progress to vascular collapse with immersion in cold water (swimming). Solar urticaria is subdivided into six groups by the response to specific portions of the light spectrum. Vibratory angioedema may occur after years of occupational exposure or can be idiopathic; it may be accompanied by cholinergic urticaria. Other rare formsofphysicalallergy,alwaysdefinedbystimulus-specificelicitation, include local heat urticaria, aquagenic urticaria fromcontactwithwater of anytemperature (sometimesassociatedwithpolycythemiavera),and contact urticaria from direct interaction with some chemical substance.",

        "content": "The most common physical urticaria is dermatographism, affecting 2% to 5% of persons. Dermatographism means \u201cwriting on the skin\u201d and is easily diagnosed by firmly scratching the skin with a blunt point, such as the wooden tip of a cotton swab or tongue depressor. It is characterized by an urticarial reaction localized to the site of skin trauma. It has been suggested that trauma induces an IgE-mediated reaction causing histamine to be released from the mast cells. Cholinergic urticaria, characterized by the appearance of 1to 3-mm wheals surrounded by large erythematous flares after an increase in core body temperature, occurs commonly in young adults. Lesions may develop during strenuous exercise, after a hot bath, or emotional stress. The lack of airway symptoms differentiates it from exercise-induced anaphylaxis.",
