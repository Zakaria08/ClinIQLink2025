Document 1 (Title: Surgical Options in the Treatment of Severe Obesity -- Issues of Concern -- Bariatric Procedures for Management of Severe Obesity): The weight loss mechanism typically falls into 1 of 2 categories, but some procedures have both components. These mechanisms include malabsorption and restriction. Neurohormonal effects contribute to the regulation of energy balance and hunger control. Key hormones include leptin and ghrelin. Examples of restrictive procedures include vertical banded gastroplasty, laparoscopic adjustable gastric band, and sleeve gastrectomy. Malabsorptive procedures include jejunoileal bypass, biliopancreatic diversion (BPD), or biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch. A combination procedure commonly performed is the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. [6]
Document 2 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): sur-gical risk,59 especially if the obesity is so severe that the patient cannot normally do self-care or would not likely be able to do so after surgery. In addition to excessive morbidity, the placement of these individuals in care facilities postoperatively for recovery is often impossible due to their size and limitations of physical ability. Finally, lack of sufficient social support or an extremely poor or unsupportive home environment can be contraindications to surgical care, since such environmental factors are important to optimize outcomes once discharged from the hospital.Brunicardi_Ch27_p1167-p1218.indd 117323/02/19 2:20 PM 1174SPECIFIC CONSIDERATIONSPART IIABCDEFGHFigure 27-5.
