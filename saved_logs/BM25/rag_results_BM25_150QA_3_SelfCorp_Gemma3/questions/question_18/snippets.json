        "content": "Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) remains a leading cause of death in infants between one month and one year of age, with peak incidence between two and four months. Following comprehensive epidemiological studies and the introduction of targeted preventive measures, SIDS rates have declined significantly over the past three decades. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and similar organizations worldwide have established evidence-based recommendations focusing on modifiable risk factors. The single most effective intervention involves infant sleep positioning, with clear evidence demonstrating that placing infants on their backs (supine position) on a firm sleep surface reduces SIDS risk by approximately 50%. This 'Back to Sleep' campaign has been credited with the dramatic reduction in SIDS rates since its introduction in the 1990s. Contrary to previous practices, maintaining a high ambient room temperature and excessive bundling are now recognized as potential risk factors rather than protective measures. Similarly, the use of positioning devices, wedges, or rolled blankets to maintain sleep position is discouraged due to suffocation risks. While some studies suggested that pacifier use during sleep might confer modest protective effects, avoiding pacifiers was not found to reduce SIDS risk. Current guidelines emphasize room-sharing without bed-sharing, avoiding soft bedding or objects in the sleep environment, and eliminating exposure to tobacco smoke as additional key preventive strategies.",

        "title": "Diagnostic Approach to Preeclampsia",
        "content": "Hypertensive disorders complicate 5-10% of pregnancies and contribute significantly to maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality worldwide. Preeclampsia, a pregnancy-specific multisystem disorder characterized by hypertension and end-organ dysfunction after 20 weeks gestation, affects approximately 3-5% of pregnancies. Early detection through regular prenatal assessments remains crucial for optimizing maternal and fetal outcomes. The contemporary diagnostic criteria for preeclampsia focus on both blood pressure parameters and evidence of maternal organ dysfunction. Hypertension, defined as systolic blood pressure \u2265140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure \u226590 mmHg on two occasions at least four hours apart, represents the fundamental requirement. Proteinuria, historically considered mandatory for diagnosis, is now recognized as just one of several possible indicators of end-organ involvement. Quantification of urinary protein excretion through 24-hour urine collection remains the gold standard assessment, with significant proteinuria defined as \u2265300 mg in 24 hours or a protein/creatinine ratio \u22650.3 mg/dL in a random sample. Other laboratory evaluations, including liver function tests and coagulation studies, help assess hepatic involvement and potential HELLP syndrome (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets). Leukocytosis may occur but lacks specificity for preeclampsia. Clinical manifestations often include rapid weight gain and generalized edema, particularly facial and periorbital, distinguishing it from dependent edema commonly observed in normal pregnancy. Progressive symptoms including headache, visual disturbances, and epigastric pain suggest impending eclampsia, necessitating urgent intervention.",

        "content": "While classic angina typically presents as substernal chest pressure exacerbated by exertion and relieved by rest or nitroglycerin, atypical presentations of myocardial ischemia occur frequently, particularly in women, diabetic patients, and elderly individuals. These variant manifestations, sometimes termed angina equivalents, include exertional dyspnea without chest discomfort, epigastric or abdominal discomfort, and jaw or arm pain without accompanying chest sensations. Upper abdominal discomfort represents a particularly challenging variant that may be misattributed to gastrointestinal etiologies, delaying appropriate cardiac evaluation. The pathophysiological basis for these atypical presentations involves complex neurological mechanisms, with cardiac nociceptive signals sharing afferent pathways with those from other visceral structures, particularly the esophagus and upper gastrointestinal tract. Patients with significant cardiovascular risk factors reporting upper abdominal discomfort that correlates with physical exertion warrant careful evaluation for potential cardiac ischemia, even in the absence of classic chest pain. Diagnostic approaches differ markedly between suspected cardiac and gastrointestinal etiologies. While endoscopic evaluation may seem intuitive for abdominal symptoms, non-invasive cardiac assessment should take precedence when the clinical presentation suggests possible angina equivalent. Exercise stress testing, with or without imaging, provides valuable diagnostic and prognostic information by detecting inducible myocardial ischemia under controlled conditions. Functional testing such as hydrogen breath testing for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth or abdominal ultrasonography for biliary disease may be appropriate in patients where cardiac etiologies have been excluded or when symptoms and risk profile suggest primary gastrointestinal pathology.",
