Document 1 (Title: Embryology and Manifestations of Diaphragmatic Hernia): Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) occurs in approximately 1 in 2,500-3,500 live births and represents a significant cause of respiratory distress in the neonatal period. The embryological basis involves defective formation of the diaphragm during weeks 4-12 of gestation, with several potential mechanisms depending on the specific anatomical variant. In most cases (80-85%), a posterolateral defect (Bochdalek hernia) results from incomplete fusion of the pleuroperitoneal membrane, which normally separates the pleural and peritoneal cavities during embryological development. This defect permits abdominal viscera to herniate into the thoracic cavity during a critical period of lung development. Left-sided defects predominate (80-85%) over right-sided ones (15-20%) due to earlier closure of the right pleuroperitoneal canal and the protective presence of the liver on the right side. The embryological timing of the diaphragmatic defect directly correlates with the severity of pulmonary hypoplasia, as herniated abdominal contents compete for thoracic space during crucial stages of lung development. Ultrasound diagnosis typically identifies the gastric fundus within the thoracic cavity as a pathognomonic finding in left-sided CDH, alongside mediastinal shift away from the affected side. This contrasts with other embryological anomalies such as annular pancreas, where pancreatic tissue encircles the duodenum causing intestinal obstruction, or hypertrophic pyloric stenosis, which develops postnatally rather than being a true embryological defect. Herniation through the inguinal canal represents a distinct pathophysiological process unrelated to diaphragmatic development.
Document 2 (Title: Etiology and Pathophysiology of Spontaneous Abortion): First-trimester pregnancy loss, clinically defined as spontaneous abortion before 13 weeks gestation, affects approximately 10-20% of clinically recognized pregnancies, with significantly higher rates when considering pre-clinical losses. While multiple etiologies contribute to early pregnancy failure, chromosomal abnormalities represent the predominant cause, accounting for approximately 50-60% of first-trimester losses. These cytogenetic aberrations predominantly arise from errors during gametogenesis or early embryonic divisions, with advancing maternal age significantly increasing risk, particularly for aneuploidies. Autosomal trisomies constitute the most common chromosomal abnormality, with trisomy 16 appearing most frequently, followed by trisomies 22, 21, and 18. Polyploidy, particularly triploidy, represents another significant cytogenetic abnormality, often associated with partial molar pregnancies. Structural chromosomal abnormalities, including translocations and inversions, contribute less frequently to sporadic losses but become increasingly significant in recurrent pregnancy loss. The pathophysiological mechanism typically involves disrupted embryonic development due to altered gene dosage, ultimately culminating in embryonic demise and subsequent expulsion. Clinical manifestations follow a characteristic sequence, beginning with embryonic death, followed by cessation of hormone production, declining progesterone and human chorionic gonadotropin levels, destabilization of the decidual-trophoblastic interface, and finally uterine contractions with expulsion of products of conception. Alternative etiologies include maternal factors such as endocrine disorders (thyroid dysfunction, uncontrolled diabetes), uterine anatomic abnormalities (septate uterus, submucosal leiomyomas), and thrombophilic conditions (antiphospholipid syndrome, inherited thrombophilias). Immunological factors, particularly alloimmune mechanisms, remain controversial and incompletely understood. External factors such as maternal exposure to toxins, including alcohol, tobacco, and certain medications, may increase risk, albeit less significantly than chromosomal factors. Physical trauma rarely causes early pregnancy loss unless associated with direct uterine injury or significant maternal hemodynamic compromise. Comprehensive evaluation for specific etiology typically follows recurrent pregnancy loss (traditionally defined as three or more consecutive losses), though contemporary approaches often initiate investigation after two losses, particularly in women of advanced reproductive age.
Document 3 (Title: Antibiotic Selection for Urinary Tract Infections During Pregnancy): Management of urinary tract infections during pregnancy requires careful antibiotic selection due to potential impacts on both maternal and fetal health. First-line agents should demonstrate efficacy against common uropathogens while minimizing fetal risk. Beta-lactams such as ampicillin have historically been used but rising resistance among Escherichia coli limits their empiric utility. Third-generation cephalosporins like ceftriaxone, while effective, are typically reserved for pyelonephritis or complicated infections requiring parenteral therapy. Tetracyclines, including doxycycline, are contraindicated during pregnancy due to risks of dental discoloration and potential inhibition of bone growth in the developing fetus. Nitrofurantoin represents an optimal choice for uncomplicated cystitis in pregnancy after the first trimester and before 36 weeks gestation, offering several advantages: it achieves high urinary tract concentrations with minimal systemic absorption, demonstrates efficacy against most urinary pathogens including E. coli, and has minimal impact on maternal and fetal intestinal flora. Clinical trials have consistently demonstrated its safety profile during the second and most of the third trimester, with no significant increase in congenital malformations. Nitrofurantoin should be avoided near term (>36 weeks) due to theoretical risk of hemolytic anemia in G6PD-deficient neonates.

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
Question: A 3900-g (8.6-lb) male infant is delivered at 39 weeks' gestation via spontaneous vaginal delivery.

Further evaluation of this patient is most likely to show which of the following findings?
Options:
A. Gastric fundus in the thorax
B. Pancreatic ring around the duodenum
C. Hypertrophy of the gastric pylorus
D. Large bowel in the inguinal canal
