Document 1 (Title: Gonadal Development and Sex Determination in Mammals): Mammalian sexual differentiation represents a precisely orchestrated cascade of molecular and cellular events establishing gonadal sex and subsequent phenotypic sexual characteristics. The process begins with genetic sex determination at fertilization, with the presence or absence of the Y chromosome initially directing developmental trajectories. Prior to approximately 6 weeks of human gestation, the embryo maintains bipotential gonads capable of differentiating toward either testicular or ovarian lineages. These bipotential structures contain primordial germ cells of extragonadal origin alongside supporting cell precursors derived from the genital ridge. The critical event in male sexual differentiation involves expression of the SRY gene (Sex-determining Region on Y chromosome), which encodes a transcription factor initiating testicular development through upregulation of SOX9 and other downstream targets. Once specified, the developing testes establish two essential cell lineages: Sertoli cells and Leydig cells. Sertoli cells, derived from supporting cell precursors, form the seminiferous tubules and create the blood-testis barrier. These cells secrete anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), a glycoprotein of the TGF-β family that induces regression of the Müllerian ducts, thereby preventing formation of female internal reproductive structures (fallopian tubes, uterus, and upper vagina). In parallel, fetal Leydig cells produce testosterone, which stimulates differentiation of the Wolffian ducts into male internal genitalia (epididymis, vas deferens, and seminal vesicles). Testosterone also undergoes peripheral conversion to dihydrotestosterone via 5α-reductase, inducing masculinization of the external genitalia. The absence of SRY expression in female embryos results in ovarian differentiation, characterized by development of primordial follicles containing oocytes surrounded by granulosa cells. Without testicular hormones, the Wolffian ducts regress while the Müllerian ducts persist, forming the female reproductive tract. Throughout development and adulthood, Sertoli cells remain crucial for spermatogenesis, providing structural and nutritional support for developing germ cells while maintaining the specialized microenvironment required for sperm production.
Document 2 (Title: Parasitology and Management of Enterobius vermicularis Infection): Enterobius vermicularis (pinworm) infection represents a common helminthic condition with distinctive clinical and epidemiological characteristics requiring accurate understanding for appropriate diagnosis and management. The parasitic lifecycle demonstrates several notable features influencing clinical presentation and treatment approaches. Following ingestion of infective eggs, larval development progresses relatively rapidly through the gastrointestinal tract, with mature female worms typically beginning egg deposition within 4-6 weeks of initial infection rather than extended 3-month maturation periods documented with certain other helminthic species. Egg deposition occurs primarily through nocturnal migration of female worms to the perianal region, creating the characteristic pruritus ani that often prompts medical attention. Pulmonary involvement including Löffler's syndrome (transient pulmonary infiltrates with eosinophilia) represents a potential manifestation of certain tissue-migrating helminthic infections but characteristically does not occur during pinworm infection due to its non-migratory lifecycle confined to the intestinal lumen. Hematological assessment typically reveals minimal abnormalities, though mild eosinophilia (5-15%) may occasionally develop in some cases, particularly with heavy parasite burdens or prolonged infection. Diagnostic approaches focus on detection of characteristic eggs through adhesive tape preparations rather than direct visualization of adult worms, which remain predominantly within the intestinal lumen rather than being evacuated through the oral route, distinguishing this infection from certain other parasitic conditions where adult worm passage may occur. Treatment typically involves benzimidazole compounds including mebendazole and albendazole, with flubendazole representing an alternative therapeutic option in some geographical regions. Comprehensive management includes treating household contacts and environmental measures addressing potential fomite transmission through bedding and clothing.
Document 3 (Title: Embryology and Manifestations of Diaphragmatic Hernia): Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) occurs in approximately 1 in 2,500-3,500 live births and represents a significant cause of respiratory distress in the neonatal period. The embryological basis involves defective formation of the diaphragm during weeks 4-12 of gestation, with several potential mechanisms depending on the specific anatomical variant. In most cases (80-85%), a posterolateral defect (Bochdalek hernia) results from incomplete fusion of the pleuroperitoneal membrane, which normally separates the pleural and peritoneal cavities during embryological development. This defect permits abdominal viscera to herniate into the thoracic cavity during a critical period of lung development. Left-sided defects predominate (80-85%) over right-sided ones (15-20%) due to earlier closure of the right pleuroperitoneal canal and the protective presence of the liver on the right side. The embryological timing of the diaphragmatic defect directly correlates with the severity of pulmonary hypoplasia, as herniated abdominal contents compete for thoracic space during crucial stages of lung development. Ultrasound diagnosis typically identifies the gastric fundus within the thoracic cavity as a pathognomonic finding in left-sided CDH, alongside mediastinal shift away from the affected side. This contrasts with other embryological anomalies such as annular pancreas, where pancreatic tissue encircles the duodenum causing intestinal obstruction, or hypertrophic pyloric stenosis, which develops postnatally rather than being a true embryological defect. Herniation through the inguinal canal represents a distinct pathophysiological process unrelated to diaphragmatic development.

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
Question: A 31-year-old G2P2 female at 40 weeks gestation presents to the hospital following a rush of water that came from her vagina. She is 4 cm dilated and 80% effaced. Fetal heart tracing shows a pulse of 155/min with variable decelerations. About 12 hours after presentation, she gives birth to a 6 lb 15 oz baby boy with APGAR scores of 8 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. Which of the following structures is responsible for inhibition of female internal genitalia?
Options:
A. Spermatogonia
B. Allantois
C. Syncytiotrophoblast
D. Sertoli cells
