Document 1 (Title: Embryology and Manifestations of Diaphragmatic Hernia): Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) occurs in approximately 1 in 2,500-3,500 live births and represents a significant cause of respiratory distress in the neonatal period. The embryological basis involves defective formation of the diaphragm during weeks 4-12 of gestation, with several potential mechanisms depending on the specific anatomical variant. In most cases (80-85%), a posterolateral defect (Bochdalek hernia) results from incomplete fusion of the pleuroperitoneal membrane, which normally separates the pleural and peritoneal cavities during embryological development. This defect permits abdominal viscera to herniate into the thoracic cavity during a critical period of lung development. Left-sided defects predominate (80-85%) over right-sided ones (15-20%) due to earlier closure of the right pleuroperitoneal canal and the protective presence of the liver on the right side. The embryological timing of the diaphragmatic defect directly correlates with the severity of pulmonary hypoplasia, as herniated abdominal contents compete for thoracic space during crucial stages of lung development. Ultrasound diagnosis typically identifies the gastric fundus within the thoracic cavity as a pathognomonic finding in left-sided CDH, alongside mediastinal shift away from the affected side. This contrasts with other embryological anomalies such as annular pancreas, where pancreatic tissue encircles the duodenum causing intestinal obstruction, or hypertrophic pyloric stenosis, which develops postnatally rather than being a true embryological defect. Herniation through the inguinal canal represents a distinct pathophysiological process unrelated to diaphragmatic development.
Document 2 (Title: Embryological Remnants of the Thyroid Migratory Pathway): The thyroid gland demonstrates a unique embryological migration, descending from its origin at the foramen cecum of the tongue base to its definitive pretracheal position. This migration occurs along a path known as the thyroglossal duct, which normally obliterates following successful thyroid descent. Incomplete involution of this embryological structure can result in several congenital anomalies, with thyroglossal duct cysts representing the most common. Embryologically, the thyroid anlage appears at the fourth week of gestation as an endodermal thickening at the foramen cecum, located at the junction of the anterior two-thirds and posterior third of the tongue. This primitive thyroid tissue subsequently descends anterior to the developing hyoid bone and laryngeal cartilages, maintaining a transient connection with the tongue base via the thyroglossal duct. The duct normally undergoes complete atrophy by the tenth gestational week, leaving only the foramen cecum as a vestigial remnant. Thyroglossal duct cysts develop when portions of this epithelial tract persist and undergo cystic degeneration, typically following infection or inflammation. These lesions demonstrate several characteristic features: midline location (though slight lateral deviation may occur, particularly at the level of the hyoid bone), intimate relationship with the hyoid bone, and upward movement during swallowing or tongue protrusion due to their attachment to the tongue base via fibrous remnants of the duct. The cysts typically contain viscous fluid and are lined by pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelium, though squamous metaplasia commonly occurs following infection. Histologically, thyroid tissue can be identified in approximately 20-25% of specimens. Differential diagnostic considerations include ectopic thyroid tissue (lingual thyroid), dermoid cysts, lymphatic malformations, and pathologically enlarged lymph nodes. Thyroid function typically remains normal, as functioning thyroid tissue has usually completed its migration before duct cyst formation. Management involves surgical excision via the Sistrunk procedure, which includes removal of the cyst, its tract, and the central portion of the hyoid bone to minimize recurrence risk. Simple cyst excision without hyoid resection results in unacceptably high recurrence rates due to retained microscopic ductal elements.
Document 3 (Title: Antibiotic Selection for Urinary Tract Infections During Pregnancy): Management of urinary tract infections during pregnancy requires careful antibiotic selection due to potential impacts on both maternal and fetal health. First-line agents should demonstrate efficacy against common uropathogens while minimizing fetal risk. Beta-lactams such as ampicillin have historically been used but rising resistance among Escherichia coli limits their empiric utility. Third-generation cephalosporins like ceftriaxone, while effective, are typically reserved for pyelonephritis or complicated infections requiring parenteral therapy. Tetracyclines, including doxycycline, are contraindicated during pregnancy due to risks of dental discoloration and potential inhibition of bone growth in the developing fetus. Nitrofurantoin represents an optimal choice for uncomplicated cystitis in pregnancy after the first trimester and before 36 weeks gestation, offering several advantages: it achieves high urinary tract concentrations with minimal systemic absorption, demonstrates efficacy against most urinary pathogens including E. coli, and has minimal impact on maternal and fetal intestinal flora. Clinical trials have consistently demonstrated its safety profile during the second and most of the third trimester, with no significant increase in congenital malformations. Nitrofurantoin should be avoided near term (>36 weeks) due to theoretical risk of hemolytic anemia in G6PD-deficient neonates.

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
Question: A male neonate is being examined by a pediatrician. His mother informs the doctor that she had a mild fever with rash, muscle pain, and swollen and tender lymph nodes during the second month of gestation. The boy was born at 39 weeks gestation via spontaneous vaginal delivery with no prenatal care. On physical examination, the neonate has normal vital signs. Retinal examination reveals the findings shown in the image. Which of the following congenital heart defects is most likely to be present in this neonate?
Options:
A. Atrial septal defect
B. Ventricular septal defect
C. Tetralogy of Fallot
D. Patent ductus arteriosus
