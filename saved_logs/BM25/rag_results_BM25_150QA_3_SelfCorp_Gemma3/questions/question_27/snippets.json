        "content": "Ovarian tumors in prepubertal girls represent uncommon but diagnostically challenging entities due to their varied presentation and potential hormonal activity. Sex cord-stromal tumors, comprising approximately 15-20% of pediatric ovarian neoplasms, frequently demonstrate endocrine manifestations due to hormone production. Within this category, granulosa cell tumors (GCTs) represent the predominant subtype with unique clinical and pathological features. Juvenile granulosa cell tumors typically present in the first decade of life, with a mean age of 6.5 years, in contrast to the adult variant more commonly seen in perimenopausal women. The hallmark endocrine manifestation involves autonomous estrogen production, causing precocious pseudopuberty with accelerated growth, breast development, and pubic/axillary hair growth corresponding to advanced Tanner staging incongruent with chronological age. Vulvar mucosal changes, vaginal discharge, and occasionally vaginal bleeding may accompany these changes. Radiologically, these tumors typically present as unilateral, predominantly solid or mixed solid-cystic masses, often with hemorrhagic components due to their vascular nature. Ultrasonography represents the initial imaging modality, with larger tumors occasionally visible on abdominal radiographs as calcified masses. Laboratory evaluation reveals elevated estradiol levels corresponding to the clinical manifestations. Tumor markers including inhibin B may assist in diagnosis and subsequent monitoring. Differential diagnostic considerations include idiopathic precocious puberty, characterized by gonadotropin-dependent changes without ovarian masses, and McCune-Albright syndrome, which features caf\u00e9-au-lait macules and polyostotic fibrous dysplasia accompanying precocious puberty. Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors, by contrast, typically produce androgens rather than estrogens, causing virilization rather than feminization, and occur more commonly in adolescents and young adults rather than young children.",

        "content": "Electronic health record interventions designed to prompt primary care providers about familial risk factors have demonstrated inconsistent implementation results across healthcare systems. Recent multicenter evaluations revealed that automated family history alerts resulted in minimal change to physician documentation patterns or referral behaviors despite technological investment. The INHERIT trial, examining 124 primary care practices, found no statistically significant difference in risk-appropriate screening rates between intervention and control groups at 18-month follow-up. Provider surveys indicated that 67% of clinicians reported ignoring automated family history prompts due to existing workflow constraints and alert fatigue. Implementation science research continues to identify substantial barriers to effective family history integration, with time limitations and competing clinical priorities consistently emerging as limiting factors. While the theoretical value of family history in risk stratification remains well-established, translating this into actionable clinical behavior change has proven challenging. Current evidence suggests that without substantial workflow redesign and provider education, technological prompting alone produces limited behavioral change in primary care settings. Qualitative analysis has identified that isolated alerting systems without integrated decision support tools and streamlined workflows demonstrate particularly poor adoption and limited clinical impact.",

        "title": "Coagulation Defects in Young Women with Menorrhagia",
        "content": "Menorrhagia, defined as excessive menstrual bleeding lasting more than 7 days or exceeding 80 mL per cycle, affects approximately 10-30% of women of reproductive age, with a significant proportion attributable to underlying bleeding disorders. When persistent since menarche and accompanied by other mucocutaneous bleeding manifestations, inherited coagulation disorders warrant particular consideration. Von Willebrand disease (VWD), the most common inherited bleeding disorder, affects approximately 1% of the general population and accounts for up to 20% of unexplained menorrhagia cases in otherwise healthy women. VWD results from quantitative or qualitative deficiencies in von Willebrand factor (VWF), a large multimeric glycoprotein that mediates platelet adhesion to subendothelial collagen and serves as a carrier for factor VIII. This autosomal inheritance pattern leads to equal sex distribution, contrasting with the X-linked recessive inheritance of hemophilia A, which primarily affects males. Laboratory evaluation of VWD typically reveals prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) due to secondary factor VIII deficiency, while prothrombin time (PT) and platelet count remain normal. Patients typically present with mucocutaneous bleeding manifestations including easy bruising, epistaxis, gingival bleeding, and particularly menorrhagia in women. Family history often reveals similar bleeding tendencies in first-degree relatives of both sexes, contrasting with the maternal uncle pattern in hemophilia A or the prothrombotic tendencies in conditions like protein C deficiency or antiphospholipid syndrome.",
