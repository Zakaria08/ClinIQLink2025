Based on the following information:

Document 1 (Title: Health Maintenance Organization -- Nursing, Allied Health, and Interprofessional Team Interventions): HMOs are a type of managed care designed to maintain the health of their patients cost-effectively. A primary method HMOs use to achieve these goals is to coordinate health services and care provided to patients. [15] Such care coordination requires collaboration among various members of the care team. Multiple strategies have sought to attempt to improve care coordination in managed care organizations such as HMOs. For example, explicitly defining the responsibility of each member of the care team is thought to improve coordination among members. [16] Financial risk-sharing strategies, such as bundled payments and capitated payments, shared among different care team members, can also incentivize increased collaboration for cost-efficient care. [17] Additionally, pharmacies have attempted to control costs without compromising care by using techniques such as drug formularies and prescribing protocols. [17] Ultimately, strategies that can incentivize communication among the various members of the care team and further align their goals can improve care coordination within an HMO.
Document 2 (Title: Cancer Screening -- Function -- Breast Cancer): As mammography rates remained constant during this period, the recent rise in breast cancer incidence cannot be attributed to increased detection through mammography. However, due to breast cancer screening, most cases are diagnosed at stage I, which has a 5-year survival rate of 100%. [6] From 1989 to 2015, breast cancer mortality dropped by 39%. The mortality rate among women aged 50 and older has continued to decline since 2007, while it has remained steady for women aged 50 or younger. [7] Widely accepted breast cancer screening modalities include mammography, breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT), breast ultrasound, and breast self-examinations.
Document 3 (Title: Health Maintenance Organization -- Issues of Concern): HMOs increased in popularity following the passage of the HMO Act in 1973, which sought to increase the usage of HMOs to improve patient care, decrease health care costs, and put a greater emphasis on preventative health care. [3] [4] In the years following the HMO Act, HMOs became a prominent method of health insurance in the United States. For example, by 1987, over 29 million Americans (12%) received care through HMOs. [1] As such, it is useful for health care providers to understand HMOs and their features.
