Based on the following information:

Document 1 (Title: Biochemistry, Lipolysis -- Mechanism): Beta oxidation is the degradation of fatty acids by removing two carbons at a time. It is the primary pathway for catabolism of fatty acids and takes place in the mitochondrial matrix of tissues such as the liver, muscle, and adipose. Two-carbon fragments are successively removed from the carboxyl end of the fatty acyl-CoA, producing NADH, FADH, and Acetyl CoA, which is used in the TCA cycle to make ATP. Fatty acids with odd numbers of carbon ultimately yield one mole of propionyl-CoA, which is converted to succinyl CoA so that it is usable in the TCA cycle. Beta oxidation is also important as the primary regulator of movement through the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex. When rates of fatty acid oxidation are high, PDH activity decreases, which limits glycolysis, which is significant because patients with a deficiency in fatty acid oxidation have a compensatory increase in glucose oxidation and impaired gluconeogenesis. Ketone synthesis
Document 2 (Title: Biochemistry, Nutrients -- Molecular Level -- Lipids): Lipids are organic molecules that share the common property of being hydrophobic. Dietary lipids are often in the forms of triglycerides, phospholipids, cholesterol, and fatty acids. Fatty acids are classified as saturated or containing no carbon-carbon double bonds, or unsaturated, or containing at least one carbon-carbon double bond. Saturated fatty acids have higher melting points than unsaturated fatty acids, making them solid at room temperature, unlike liquid unsaturated fatty acids. Triglycerides are composed of one 3-carbon glycerol backbone and three fatty acids. Phospholipids contain a phosphate head connected to a glycerol molecule, connected to two fatty acids. Cholesterol is a sterol that is composed of a hydrocarbon ring structure. [48]
Document 3 (Title: Low Fat Diet -- Clinical Significance): There has been a direct relationship between dietary fat intake and cardiovascular disease (CVD). [11] Besides, dietary cholesterol has been a focus of considerable attention due to a direct connection between diet and blood cholesterol levels and the subsequent risk for coronary artery disease. [12] The level of LDL particles is the best predictor of cardiovascular risk. [13] [14] Studies have concluded that saturated fatty acids raised blood cholesterol levels, whereas PUFA's reduced serum cholesterol levels and MUFA's were neutral. [15] Studies have also found myristic and palmitic acid to have cholesterol elevating effects, whereas stearic acid did not affect the levels. [16] Trans fatty acids are similar to saturated fatty acids in raising cholesterol, as well. [17] The level of saturated fats, trans-fatty acids should be low, and the levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids should be high. [15] The results from the Nurses' Health Study, in which the women who consumed diets low in saturated and trans fatty acids and relatively high in unhydrogenated mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids had the least risk for cardiovascular outcomes. [18]
