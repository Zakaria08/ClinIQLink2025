        "content": "The current Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends for children doses of DTaP or DT at 2, 4, and 6 months of age, with additional doses between 15 and 18 months, and between 4 and 6 years. [2] This regimen is followed by 1 booster of Tdap at age 11 or 12, followed by a booster every 10 years thereafter. Adult Td or Tdap vaccine is recommended every 10 years with complete prior immunization. Of those doses, one must be Tdap for\u00a0more than 19 years old. In those previously unvaccinated, a series of 3 vaccines will be given. One\u00a0dose is given 4 weeks from the first dose, then the last dose 6 to 12 months later. At least one dose is Tdap, and the other 2\u00a0can be Td or Tdap. A booster is also indicated every 10 years thereafter. The rationale for a booster every 10 years is due to waning immunity. Between 1988 and 1994, the United States serologic survey finds protective titers of tetanus antibodies were detected in 72% aged 6 years old, up to 91% aged 6 and 11 years old, down 47% aged 20 years or older, and significantly down to 31% aged more than 70 years old. [3] Tetanus prophylaxis includes understanding and knowing the current tetanus immunization guideline(s), recommendation(s), and indication(s) for prophylaxis. The key to the prevention of tetanus is immunization, identification of those at risk, and proper identification and treatment of wounds and traumatic injuries.",
