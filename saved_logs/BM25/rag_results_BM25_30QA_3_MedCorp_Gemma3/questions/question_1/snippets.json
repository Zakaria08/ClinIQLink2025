        "content": "Dental infections are polymicrobial, caused by a mixture of anaerobic and aerobic bacteria. [22] The selected antimicrobial must target these bacteria. For outpatients, combining penicillin, usually amoxicillin, with a beta-lactamase inhibitor provides appropriate coverage. [1] [22] An alternate antimicrobial is metronidazole, which has improved pharmacokinetics and is better tolerated than erythromycin. Metronidazole is indicated as a first-line treatment when patients are allergic to penicillin, received penicillin recently for another infection, or if the infection is caused by predominantly anaerobic bacteria, which is confirmed with culture. Metronidazole is also used in combination with penicillin in severe spreading infections.",
