Urethritis is primarily diagnosed based on clinical assessment, medical history, and physical examination. However, specific diagnostic laboratory tests are used for a more precise diagnosis. [31] A diagnosis of urethritis is typically established based on examination revealing evidence of any of the following: Mucopurulent or purulent discharge from the urethral meatus. Detection of 2 or more WBCs per oil immersion field from a gram stain of a urethral swab. [41] Positive leukocyte esterase and/or the presence of 10 or more WBCs per high-power field of the first-voided urine in the absence of a UTI.",
