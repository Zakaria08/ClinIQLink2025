Based on the following information:

Document 1 (Title: Embryology, Rectum and Anal Canal -- Testing): Electromyography : A test to measure the ability of the puborectalis muscle and sphincter muscles to relax properly. An electrode is placed inside the rectum, and the activity of these muscles gets evaluated throughout a series of stages (relaxation, contraction, and evacuation). [16] Endoanal Ultrasonography : The use of ultrasound imaging to examine rectal lesions, defects, or injuries to the surrounding tissues. [16]
Document 2 (Title: Urethritis -- Evaluation): Urethritis is suspected clinically when any sexually active patient presents with symptoms such as urethral pruritus, discharge, or dysuria. Urethritis is primarily diagnosed based on clinical assessment, medical history, and physical examination. However, specific diagnostic laboratory tests are used for a more precise diagnosis. [31] A diagnosis of urethritis is typically established based on examination revealing evidence of any of the following: Mucopurulent or purulent discharge from the urethral meatus. Detection of 2 or more WBCs per oil immersion field from a gram stain of a urethral swab. [41] Positive leukocyte esterase and/or the presence of 10 or more WBCs per high-power field of the first-voided urine in the absence of a UTI.
Document 3 (Title: Radiation Therapy for Anal Cancer -- Differential Diagnosis): The differential diagnosis for anal cancer is broad and dependent upon its clinical presentation. Bright red blood per rectum may also be the result of hemorrhoids, polyps, diverticulosis, anal fissures, ulcers, abscess, or proctitis. A sizeable malignant mass at the anus may also originate from the rectum, bladder, prostate, or vagina.
