        "content": "Chest radiographs: Chest radiographs are recommended for patients presenting with respiratory symptoms in suspected scrub typhus cases. These images may reveal pleural effusions and pneumonia, including para-pneumonic effusions. Although relatively uncommon, ARDS characterized by bilateral heterogeneous diffuse infiltrates can be a severe complication of scrub typhus. Therefore, the diagnosis of scrub typhus relies heavily on maintaining a high level of clinical suspicion and using diagnostic tests judiciously, especially in areas with high endemicity.",
