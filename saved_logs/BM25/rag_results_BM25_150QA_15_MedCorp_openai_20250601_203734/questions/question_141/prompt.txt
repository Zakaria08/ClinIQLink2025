Document 1 (Title: Alkaline phosphatase): Leukocyte alkaline phosphatase Leukocyte alkaline phosphatase (LAP) is found within mature white blood cells. White blood cell levels of LAP can help in the diagnosis of certain conditions. Higher levels are seen in the physiological response, the leukemoid reaction, and in pathologies that include mature white blood cells, such as polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocytosis (ET), and in primary myelofibrosis (PM). Lower levels are found in pathologies that involve undeveloped leukocytes, such as chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML).
Document 2 (Title: Polycythemia vera): Following history and examination, the British Committee for Standards in Haematology (BCSH) recommend the following tests are performed: full blood count/film (raised hematocrit; neutrophils, basophils, platelets raised in half of patients) JAK2 mutation serum ferritin renal and liver function tests If the JAK2 mutation is negative and there is no obvious secondary causes the BCSH suggest the following tests: red cell mass arterial oxygen saturation abdominal ultrasound serum erythropoietin level bone marrow aspirate and trephine cytogenetic analysis erythroid burst-forming unit (BFU-E) culture Other features that may be seen in polycythemia vera include a low ESR and a raised leukocyte alkaline phosphatase. The diagnostic criteria for polycythemia vera have recently been updated by the BCSH. This replaces the previous Polycythemia Vera Study Group criteria. JAK2-positive polycythemia vera - diagnosis requires both criteria to be present:
Document 3 (Title: Familial polycythemia vera.): The occurrence of polycythemia vera in a father, mother, and two sons is reported. Thirteen kindreds with familial polycythemia vera in 31 members are reviewed. Comprehensive records were available for all four patients as well as other family members, since all were diagnosed and treated at the author's institution over a period of nearly 50 years. The mean age at diagnosis, sex predominance, symptoms, and incidence of chromosomal abnormalities, leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, and elevated leukocyte alkaline phosphatase levels were similar to those of nonfamilial cases. The mean RBC volume at diagnosis and the incidence of splenomegaly appear to be higher in familial than nonfamilial cases. The mode of inheritance is unclear, but genetic factors may be involved in the pathogenesis of this myeloproliferative disorder.
Document 4 (Title: Vitamin B12-binding proteins in serum and plasma in various disorders. Effect of anticoagulants.): Because of recent developments in the study of vitamin B12-binding proteins, the levels of the three serum binders were compared in serum and plasma samples from subjects with various disorders. The results allow the following conclusions: (1) As previously reported, transcobalamin (TC) III and to a lesser extent TC I are artifactually elevated in serum. The appear to be released in vitro during the clotting process, presumably from granulocytes. (2) Blood cells of patients with polycythemia vera release exceedingly large amounts of TC I and TC III in vitro. (3) The above findings support, but do not prove, at least a partial granulocytic source of TC I. Nevertheless, factors other than granulocytes influence TC I levels, as disorders characterized by increased TC I (most prominently chronic myelogenous leukemia but also several cases of cancer) manifest relatively little cellular release of TC I in vitro. (4) Despite the serum artifact, the serum abnormalities described in various conditions were seen in pla...
Document 5 (Title: Myeloproliferative neoplasm): Diagnosis People with MPNs might not have symptoms when their disease is first detected via blood tests. Depending on the nature of the myeloproliferative neoplasm, diagnostic tests may include red cell mass determination (for polycythemia), bone marrow aspirate and trephine biopsy, arterial oxygen saturation and carboxyhaemoglobin level, neutrophil alkaline phosphatase level, vitamin B12 (or B12 binding capacity), serum urate or direct sequencing of the patient's DNA. According to WHO diagnostic criteria published in 2016, myeloproliferative neoplasms are diagnosed as follows: Chronic myeloid leukemia Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) has a presence of the hallmark Philadelphia Chromosome (BCR-ABL1) mutation. Chronic neutrophilic leukemia Chronic neutrophilic leukemia (CNL) is characterized by a mutation in the CSF3R gene and an exclusion of other causes of neutrophilia. Essential thrombocythemia
