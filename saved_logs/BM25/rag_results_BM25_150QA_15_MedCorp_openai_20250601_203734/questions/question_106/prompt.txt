Document 4 (Title: Traumatic stress): Reactive attachment disorder Reactive attachment disorder is a trauma disorder that arises when a parent does not console an upset child. A repetition of this behavior causes sadness, irritability, and fear, which can then lead to the disorder. A cluster of symptoms relating to indiscriminate behaviors is regarded as dis-inhibited social engagement disorder rather than reactive attachment disorder; symptoms of reactive attachment disorder must be inhibited. Both dis-inhibited social engagement disorder and reactive attachment disorder are related to severe pathogenic care. Acute stress disorder Another disorder in this category is acute stress disorder, which is listed in DSM-5 under code 308.3, ICD-10, F43.0. According to the DSM-5 "Acute Stress Disorder is caused by trauma (traumatic stress) and lasts at least 3 days."
Document 5 (Title: Adenine phosphoribosyltransferase deficiency): Genetics APRT deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. This means the defective gene responsible for the disorder is located on an autosome, and two copies of the defective gene (one inherited from each parent) are required in order to be born with the disorder. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive disorder both carry one copy of the defective gene, but usually do not experience any signs or symptoms of the disorder. Characteristics The disorder results in accumulation of the insoluble purine 2,8-dihydroxyadenine. It can result in nephrolithiasis (kidney stones), acute renal failure and permanent kidney damage.
