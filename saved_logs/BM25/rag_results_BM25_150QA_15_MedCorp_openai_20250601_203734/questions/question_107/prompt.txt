Document 1 (Title: Dopamine beta-hydroxylase): Assays for DBH activity in human serum and Cerebrospinal fluid DBH activity in human serum could be estimated by a spectrophotometric method or with the aid of Ultra high performance liquid chromatography with Photo Diode Array detector (UHPLC-PDA). A sensitive assay for the detection of DBH activity in cerebrospinal fluid using High-performance liquid chromatography with Electrochemical detector(HPLC-ECD) was also described earlier. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) at DBH loci Genetic variants such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms(SNPs) at DBH loci were found to be associated with DBH activity and are well known expression quantitative trait loci. Allele variants at two regulatory SNPs namely rs1611115 and rs1989787 were shown to affect transcription of this gene. Mutations identified in Dopamine beta hydroxylase deficiency and non-synonymous SNPs such as rs6271 in this gene were found to cause defective secretion of the protein from the endoplasmic reticulum.
Document 2 (Title: Gas chromatography ion detector): Types of Ion Detectors Flame ionization detector (FID) -- uses a flame to produce ions Electron capture detector (ECD) -- uses beta radiation Photo-ionization detector (PID) -- uses UV light to produce ions Helium ionization detector (HID) -- uses a radioactive source to produce helium ions, which in turn ionize the components Discharge ionization detector (DID) -- uses an electric spark source to produce helium ions, which in turn ionize the components Pulsed discharge ionization detector (PDD) -- similar to a Discharge ionization detector (DID), but uses a different sort of spark References See also Gas Chromatograph Chromatography detector Gas chromatography
Document 3 (Title: Gas chromatography): Flame photometric detector (FPD) uses a photomultiplier tube to detect spectral lines of the compounds as they are burned in a flame. Compounds eluting off the column are carried into a hydrogen fueled flame which excites specific elements in the molecules, and the excited elements (P,S, Halogens, Some Metals) emit light of specific characteristic wavelengths. The emitted light is filtered and detected by a photomultiplier tube. In particular, phosphorus emission is around 510–536 nm and sulfur emission is at 394 nm. With an atomic emission detector (AED), a sample eluting from a column enters a chamber which is energized by microwaves that induce a plasma. The plasma causes the analyte sample to decompose and certain elements generate an atomic emission spectra. The atomic emission spectra is diffracted by a diffraction grating and detected by a series of photomultiplier tubes or photo diodes.
Document 4 (Title: The identification of related substances in triamcinolone acetonide by means of high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detector and mass spectrometry.): A study of an HPLC method for the analysis of related substances in triamcinolone acetonide is described. Several systems of solvents and samples of different lots and preparative origins were examined and a rapid-scanning diode array UV detector (DAD) was particularly useful. With the proposed technique it was possible to identify 9 alpha-bromo desonide as a principal impurity, which was present in all examined samples of triamcinolone acetonide. This identification was rendered possible by the investigation of the second derivative of the UV spectra and by means of study of the mass spectrum. Furthermore, it was possible, primarily on the basis of the spectrophotometric data, to formulate reliable hypotheses on the possible identification of 9 beta, 11 beta-epoxide of the desonide which was present at very low levels and to exclude the presence of 11-deoxy-9(11)-unsaturated desonide. The presence of the above-mentioned related substances was explained considering the scheme of synthesis described in the lit...
Document 5 (Title: Gas chromatography): History Background Chromatography dates to 1903 in the work of the Russian scientist, Mikhail Semenovich Tswett, who separated plant pigments via liquid column chromatography. Invention The invention of gas chromatography is generally attributed to Anthony T. James and Archer J.P. Martin. Their gas chromatograph used partition chromatography as the separating principle, rather than adsorption chromatography. The popularity of gas chromatography quickly rose after the development of the flame ionization detector. Martin and another one of their colleagues, Richard Synge, with whom he shared the 1952 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, had noted in an earlier paper that chromatography might also be used to separate gases. Synge pursued other work while Martin continued his work with James.
