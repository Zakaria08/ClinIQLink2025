She was treated with prednisolone which was used for the first time. Two weeks later, she had a fever and her chest X-ray showed diffuse reticulonodular shadows on both middle to lower lung fields. In spite of the use of antibacterial drugs, her symptoms such as cough, dyspnea, malaise and fever increased. It was revealed that she had Stronglyoides sterocoralis in the stool. She was referred to our department for treatment and further examination. Transbronchial lung biopsy (TBLB) was performed, and cyst of Pneumocystis carinii were histologically detected in the lung specimen.

After sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (ST compound) was used for the Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, her symptoms markedly subsided, and the chest X-ray findings turned to normal by 45 days after the treatment. Thiabendazole was initially administered for the Strongyloidiasis and the parasite temporarily disappeared from both sputum and stool. Then pyrvinium pamoate and mebendazole were used, but the parasite could not be completely eradicated in the stool. We did not treat the smoldering ATL because there were no symptoms.

Then the intensive therapy with antituberculosis drugs (isoniazid 400 mg, rifampicin 450 mg, and streptomycin 1g, daily) was started. The non specific antibiotics were discontinued; hydrocortisone was tapered and stopped. The next week, she became afebrile and hypoxemia steadily improved.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "title": "A dying patient: the question of euthanasia.",
        "content": "Mrs. A. B., a 61-year-old woman who presented with carcinoma of the breast in 1964, was readmitted to the hospital in 1974 in respiratory distress ensuing from chronic lung disease and metastatic illness. An active member of Alcoholics Anonymous for the past sixteen years, she had a living pattern in which she felt in control of herself, and from which she derived an important sense of self-esteem. Although in the hospital she requested that no extraordinary measures be taken to prolong her life, when she went into respiratory failure the house staff on duty intubated her and placed her in the Intensive Care Unit. Even though her physical condition rapidly improved, the patient told her own physician that she wanted to be extubated and off Intensive Care, despite her knowledge of a probable short survival. When her request was agreed to, contrary to expectations, she continued to improve. A lawyer, interested in problems of dying and euthanasia, interviewed her, and subsequently Psychosocial Rounds were held. The general conclusions at the Rounds were that she would die an appropriate death, and that euthanasia would not be possible under current circumstances. The staff at the Conference decided to accept at face value her request that she be allowed to die without heroic measures and with dignity.",

        "content": "We reported a case of pneumonitis due to Sho-saiko-to. A 71-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital because of pneumonia. She complained of dry cough, pyrexia and severe dyspnea. Fine crepitation was heard on physical examination of the chest and a chest X-ray film revealed diffuse reticulo-nodular shadow in both lung fields. We suspected summer-type hypersensitivity pneumonitis and followed her up, however her condition deteriorated. Under a suspicion of drug-induced pneumonitis, all drugs were stopped and she was given prednisolone. Consequently her complaints, laboratory data and chest X-ray findings markedly improved. Microscopic examination of a transbronchial lung biopsy specimens showed interstitial pneumonitis. The results of a lymphocyte stimulation test were positive for sho-saiko-to. She gave informed consent after receiving an explanation of the challenge test. She was tested with 2.5 g sho-saiko-to twice and developed high fever and dyspnea with hypoxia, while the chest X-ray film also revealed diffuse infiltrative shadows similar that on admission. Based on these findings, we diagnosed this case as pneumonitis due to sho-saiko-to. To our knowledge, there has been no previous case of pulmonary hypersensitivity due to sho-saiko-to reported in the world.",
