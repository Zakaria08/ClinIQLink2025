With your own knowledge and the help of the following document:

Document 1 (Title: MasterFormat): Related Organizational Formats SectionFormat® is a standard for organizing information within each Section. Like MasterFormat®, SectionFormat® is a joint publication of the Construction Specifications Institute (CSI) and Construction Specifications Canada (CSC). It is used by MasterSpec, SpecText, NMS, and SpecsIntact systems. It is also common among manufacture specifications and design firm office masters. A Section is divided into three Parts; "Part 1 - General," "Part 2 - Products," and "Part 3 - Execution." Each Part is further organized into a system of Articles and Paragraphs. MasterFormat®'s Division 01 is extensively coordinated with SectionFormat®'s Part 1 to reduce duplication of requirements common to multiple sections.
Document 2 (Title: Intravenous prophylhexedrine (Benzedrex®) abuse and sudden death.): Propylhexedrine was implicated in 15 deaths investigated by the Dallas County Medical Examiner since 1973. Twelve of the deaths were attributable to intravenous abuse of the contents of the Benzedrex® inhaler. Each death could be defined as sudden. Pulmonary edema, foreign body granulomas, fibrosis and evidence of pulmonary hypertension were frequent postmortem findings. Right ventricular hypertrophy was present in nine of the 12 subjects who died of intravenous propylhexedrine abuse. Two homicides and one suicide were propylhexedrine-related. Intravenous propylhexedrine abuse should be considered in the differential diagnosis of right ventricular hypertrophy and/or pulmonary hypertension, and it should be suspected in cases of sudden death involving young adults displaying evidence of intravenous drug abuse.
Document 3 (Title: VIX): In addition to VIX, CBOE uses the same methodology to compute the following related products: CBOE ShortTerm Volatility Index (VIX9DSM), which reflects 9-day expected volatility of the S&P 500 Index, CBOE S&P 500® 3-Month Volatility Index (VIX3MSM), CBOE S&P 500® 6-Month Volatility Index (VIX6MSM) CBOE S&P 500 1-Year Volatility Index (VIX1YSM). CBOE also calculates the Nasdaq-100® Volatility Index (VXNSM), CBOE DJIA® Volatility Index (VXDSM) and the CBOE Russell 2000® Volatility Index (RVXSM). There is even a VIX on VIX (VVIX) which is a volatility of volatility measure in that it represents the expected volatility of the 30-day forward price of the CBOE Volatility Index (the VIX®).

Document 5 (Title: Rabbit hemorrhagic disease): Disinfection Caliciviruses are stable in the environment and difficult to inactivate. Products commonly used for household disinfection such as Clorox® and Lysol® disinfecting wipes do not work against these viruses. One effective option is to wipe down surfaces with a 10% bleach solution, allowing 10 minutes of contact time before rinsing. Other disinfectants shown to work include 10% sodium hydroxide, 2% One-Stroke Environ®, Virkon® S, Clorox® Healthcare Bleach Germicidal Wipes, Trifectant®, Rescue®, and hydrogen peroxide cleaners. Surface debris must always be mechanically removed prior to disinfection. A list of disinfectants that are effective against calicivirus (in this case norovirus) can be found on the Environmental Protection Agency's website. Studies have show that many quaternary ammonium compound based disinfectants do not inactivate caliciviruses.
