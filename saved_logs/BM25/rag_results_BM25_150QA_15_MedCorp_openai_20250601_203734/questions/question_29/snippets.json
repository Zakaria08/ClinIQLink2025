        "content": "A 54-year-old woman developed headache and slight fever. When she consulted a physician, she could not move either of her eyes to the right. Cranial CT scan revealed no significant findings. Lumbar puncture was performed and CSF examination showed the cell count of 10,304/mm3, glucose level of 10 mg/dl, and total protein value of 270 mg/dl. Her symptoms and laboratory findings suggested meningitis and she was admitted to our hospital. Neurological examination revealed bilateral dilated pupils with sluggish light reflex, right gaze palsy, and hypesthesia of the left side of her face. A diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis was established by a positive test for acid-fast bacillus in CSF, and anti-tuberculous therapy was started at once. One month after the onset of symptoms, her main complaints were double vision and cerebellar ataxia. Both CT and MRI revealed a right brain-stem lesion. Pre-contrast CT could not clearly visualize the lesion but with contrast medium a homogeneously-enhanced circular lesion was shown. MRI on T2WI demonstrated the right brain-stem lesion to have a central bright core with hypointense periphery, which in turn was surrounded by hyperintensity. The lesion appeared isointense with cerebral white matter and the \"central bright core\" area was demonstrated to be slightly hypointense on T1WI. On post-contrast T1WI (with Gd-DTPA), the lesion showed strong homogeneous enhancement. The CT and MRI findings indicated a brain-stem tuberculoma, which was regarded as the cause of the ocular movement paralysis and cerebellar ataxia. As the clinical symptoms gradually resolved with anti-tuberculous treatment, the MRI appearance of the lesion also improved.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

She had sometimes noticed headache later than 1976, and blurred vision without headache several times a year later than 1983. She had been told her right pupil dilated when she had complained of blurred vision. Neurological examination revealed abnormal findings as follows; diminished sense of smell in the right side, anisocoria (R 8 mm, L 5 mm), bilateral hippus, hypesthesioalgesia in her right face, left trunk and left arm. The pupils were round and contracted promptly to light. Accommodation reflex and ciliospinal reflexes were normal. Neither blepharoptosis nor external ocular muscle paresis were observed. Deep tendon reflexes were normal. Planter responses were flexor. There was no meningeal irritative sign. No abnormal findings were obtained in blood and urine, chest X-p, brain enhanced CT scan, EEG, and cerebral angiography except for slight degree of anemia. Serum TPHA was negative. However, the cell count of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was 18/mm3 (Ly 100%) and decreased to 9/mm3 (Ly 100%) in nine days. Protein content and glucose level of CSF were normal.

She was otherwise neurologically normal. Her sensory neuropathy was complicated by autoamputation of phalanges, pathologic fractures, failed total hip replacement, burns, pressure ulcers, and a painless peptic ulcer. An unusual cluster of functional deficits occurred when she was unable to substitute vision for peripheral sensibility. In the sudden darkness of a power failure she would fall to the floor; we advised the installation of battery-operated safety lights activated by a drop in line voltage. Voice-activated lights overcame difficulty in finding light switches in darkened rooms. She was unable to drive at night until she had a light placed under the dashboard of her car so she could see the foot pedals. She was unable to wash her hair, as shampoo irritation made her close her eyes and lose balance; swimming goggles and a nonfogging mirror permitted independence in her hair care.

        "content": "An 18-year-old woman with pseudoxanthoma elasticum had sudden profound bilateral visual loss, presumably as a result of optic nerve infarction caused by anemia and hypotension from massive gastrointestinal bleeding. Her central visual acuity largely recovered in her right eye, but her left eye had only hand motions acuity. During the subsequent 24 years, she underwent three separate surgical procedures for gastrointestinal bleeding. Abdominal arterial angiography showed numerous aneurysms of the gastric arteries. A subtotal gastrectomy was done, and histopathologic examination found advanced degenerative changes of the elastic lamina of the gastric arteries. At age 42 years, the patient lost residual vision in her right eye. This was caused by an extrafoveal subretinal choroidal neovascular membrane, which was obliterated with laser photocoagulation. Degeneration of elastic tissue, the primary defect in this syndrome, may cause cardiovascular complications and formation of breaks in the Bruch membrane, which are visible as angioid streaks. Ingrowth of fibrovascular tissue through angioid streaks may cause disturbances of macular function. The optic nerve ischemia and infarction associated with the profound visual loss in this patient reminds the ophthalmologist of the systemic nature of this disorder and the possibility that systemic vascular complications with massive blood loss may occur.",

An 18-year-old woman with pseudoxanthoma elasticum had sudden profound bilateral visual loss, presumably as a result of optic nerve infarction caused by anemia and hypotension from massive gastrointestinal bleeding. Her central visual acuity largely recovered in her right eye, but her left eye had only hand motions acuity. During the subsequent 24 years, she underwent three separate surgical procedures for gastrointestinal bleeding. Abdominal arterial angiography showed numerous aneurysms of the gastric arteries. A subtotal gastrectomy was done, and histopathologic examination found advanced degenerative changes of the elastic lamina of the gastric arteries. At age 42 years, the patient lost residual vision in her right eye. This was caused by an extrafoveal subretinal choroidal neovascular membrane, which was obliterated with laser photocoagulation. Degeneration of elastic tissue, the primary defect in this syndrome, may cause cardiovascular complications and formation of breaks in the Bruch membrane, which are visible as angioid streaks. Ingrowth of fibrovascular tissue through angioid streaks may cause disturbances of macular function. The optic nerve ischemia and infarction associated with the profound visual loss in this patient reminds the ophthalmologist of the systemic nature of this disorder and the possibility that systemic vascular complications with massive blood loss may occur.",

        "title": "[Detection of immune complexes in the sera and around the muscle fibers in a case of myasthenia gravis and polymyositis].",
        "content": "A case of myasthenia gravis accompanied with polymyositis and malignant thymoma, detected immune complexes in the sera and around the muscle fibers, was described. A 37-year-old woman was admitted to Shinshu University Hospital in September, 1987 because of dyspnea, dysphagia and muscle weakness. She first noticed her right blepharoptosis 3 weeks before admission. Weakness of all four limbs and myalgia of lower extremities were noticed one week later. These symptoms got worse and nocturnal dyspnea, dysphagia and easy fatigability at mastication appeared. On admission, she looked ill and neurological examination revealed left blepharoptosis, bilateral facial weakness, weakness of all four limbs, more prominent in proximal muscles and tenderness of lower extremities. Edrophonium test was positive, improving her muscle weakness. Laboratory examination revealed the elevated serum levels of CK, the increased titre of circulating immune complexes and high titres of acetylcholine receptor antibodies and anti-skeletal muscle antibodies. Electromyographic study showed myogenic pattern and Harvey-Masland test revealed waning at low frequency stimulation. Muscle biopsy showed marked perivascular infiltration of lymphocytes, accompanied by phagocytosis and interstitial fibrosis. IgG deposits were shown around the muscle fibers exclusively around the infiltrates of mononuclear cells. Granular deposits of C3 were also shown specifically around the muscle fibers exclusively around the infiltrates of mononuclear cells. Thymectomy was performed on September 21, 1987. Invasion of thymoma, predominantly lymphocytic type, to right lung and pericardium was observed histologically. After thymectomy, she got better. Immunological data and immunohistochemical examination of the present case suggest that in the case of myasthenia gravis accompanied with polymyositis and malignant thymoma, immune complexes may play a primary role on the pathogenesis of myositis.",

        "content": "A 13-year-old girl was struck by a car while riding her bicycle. She was comatose on her arrival at the hospital. Neurological examination revealed no focal sign except for right oculo-motor palsy. She became alert 15 days after the head injury when she first experienced a coarse tremor-like movement on the right arm. Neurological examination showed persistent oculo-motor palsy on the right side, decreased sensation of pain and touch on the left. There was no pyramidal deficit. Her gait and speech were normal and joint sensation was intact. A coarse tremor of the right arm was induced by volitional movements especially such as maintaining the arm in certain posture. It was not present at rest. Trajectory of finger-to-nose test was fairly well. However, the tremor became worse when the patient kept her finger near the target. Occasionally myoclonic-jerk and movement oppositionniste were mixed. Superficial EMG recordings of the tremor revealed 4 c/s rhythmic reciprocal grouping discharges, alternating flexor and extensor muscles. From these features, the abnormal movement should better be called tremor type of hyperkinésie volitionnelle (HV). The HV subsided spontaneously 4 months later. MRI of T2-weighted image showed high-intensity areas corresponding anatomically to the caudal part of right red nucleus and the right superior cerebellar peduncle just before its decussation. It is widely believed that lesions in cerebellar outflow pathway (i.e. dentate, red nucleus and thalamus) can cause HV.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
