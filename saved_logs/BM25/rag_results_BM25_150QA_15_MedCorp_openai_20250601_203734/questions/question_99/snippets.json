Many studies associate the sex hormone testosterone with sexual desire. Another hormone thought to influence sexual desire is oxytocin. Exogenous administration of moderate amounts of oxytocin has been found to stimulate females to desire and seek out sexual activity. In women, oxytocin levels are at their highest during sexual activity. In males, the frequency of ejaculation affects libido. If roughly a week passes between ejaculations, there will be a stronger desire for sexual activity. Interventions Medical interventions are available for individuals who feel sexually bored, experience performance anxiety, or are unable to orgasm. For everyday life, a 2013 fact sheet from the Association for Reproductive Health Professionals recommends erotic literature and recalling instances when one felt sexy and sexual.

Plasma FT and other measures of androgenicity were substantially lower in the oral contraceptive (OC) group. Correlations between FT and certain behavioral and attitudinal measures were found in the OC users but not the nonusers. In the OC users, FT was positively associated with frequency of sexual intercourse but not with frequency of masturbation. It was negatively associated with restrictive sexual morality. Correlations between FT and measures of gender role behavior were negligible, and FT was unrelated to proceptivity, homosexual interest, or the use of sexual fantasy. The occurrence of some predicted correlations among pill-using women but not the nonusers requires explanation, particularly in view of the substantially lower levels of FT in the pill-using group. It is suggested that androgen-behavior relationships in women are easily obscured by psychosocial influences and in this sample of young women such influences may have been more powerful among those not using OCs. Such psychosocial influences are likely to differ at different stages of women's life cycles. The importance of controlling for such influences in any study of hormone-sexual behavior relationships in women is emphasized, and the need for prospective studies of women before and after starting on steroidal contraception is recognized.",
