Document 1 (Title: Safe to Sleep): In 1992, the first National Infant Sleep Position (NISP) Household Survey was conducted to determine the usual position in which U.S. mothers placed their babies to sleep: lateral (side), prone (stomach), supine (back), other, or no usual position. According to the 1992 NISP survey, 13.0% of U.S. infants were positioned in the supine position for sleep. According to the 2006 NISP survey 75.7% of infants were positioned in the supine position to sleep. According the CDC, the four tips for parents and caregivers to help a baby sleep safety are as follows: 1.)Place your baby on his or her back for all sleep times-naps and at night. 2.)Use a firm sleep surface, such as a mattress in a safety-approved crib. 3.) Keep soft bedding such as blankets, pillows, bumper pads, and soft toys out of baby’s sleep area. 4.) have baby share your room, not your bed.

Document 2 (Title: Sudden infant death syndrome): Prevention A number of measures have been found to be effective in preventing SIDS, including changing the sleeping position to supine, breastfeeding, limiting soft bedding, immunizing the infant and using pacifiers. The use of electronic monitors has not been found to be useful as a preventative strategy. The effect that fans might have on the risk of SIDS has not been studied well enough to make any recommendation about them. Evidence regarding swaddling is unclear regarding SIDS. A 2016 review found tentative evidence that swaddling increases the risk of SIDS, especially among babies placed on their bellies or sides while sleeping. Measures not shown to be useful include positioning devices and baby monitors. Companies that sell the monitors do not have FDA approval for them as medical devices. Sleep positioning
Document 3 (Title: Tummy time): Tummy time is a colloquialism for placing infant children in the prone position while awake and supervised, to encourage development of the neck and trunk muscles and prevent skull deformations. In 1992, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended babies sleep on their backs to prevent Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). Although the rate of SIDS decreased by 50% since the Safe to Sleep campaign started in 1994, an unintended consequence was that babies missed out on the twelve or so hours they used to spend in the prone position while asleep, and there was a sharp increase in plagiocephaly (flat head syndrome) in infants. Along with tummy time, rotating the direction infants lie in their cribs as well as avoiding too much time in car seats, carriers, and bouncers are behaviors recommended to alleviate the associated risks of infants sleeping in a supine position. Impact on development
Document 4 (Title: Infant bed): Placing a child into an infant bed can put strain on a caretaker's back as they typically have a mass between and at 36 months of age. To reduce the strain on those operating an infant bed, many infant beds feature: a mattress that can be in a raised position until the child is able to sit upright, and potentially lowered further when they are likely to begin standing (between 8 and 12 months). casters to make it easier to move the bed around. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that infants under 12 months share a room (but not a bed) with their parents, as this has shown to be protective against sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Other sleep environment factors include supine positioning (back sleeping), use of a firm sleep surface, breastfeeding, consideration of a pacifier (dummy), and avoidance of soft bedding, overheating, and exposure to tobacco smoke.

Document 5 (Title: Sudden infant death syndrome): The most effective method of reducing the risk of SIDS is putting a child less than one year old on their back to sleep. Other measures include a firm mattress separate from but close to caregivers, no loose bedding, a relatively cool sleeping environment, using a pacifier, and avoiding exposure to tobacco smoke. Breastfeeding and immunization may also be preventive. Measures not shown to be useful include positioning devices and baby monitors. Evidence is not sufficient for the use of fans. Grief support for families affected by SIDS is important, as the death of the infant is sudden, without witnesses, and often associated with an investigation.
