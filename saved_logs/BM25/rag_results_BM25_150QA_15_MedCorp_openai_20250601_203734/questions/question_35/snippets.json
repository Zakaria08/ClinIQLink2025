        "contents": "Root Cause Analysis and Medical Error Prevention -- Function -- Case example 1. A 42-year-old primigravida woman at 34 weeks gestation was brought to the obstetric emergency department at midnight with complaints of severe headache, blurry vision, and right upper quadrant pain for the last 5 to 6 hours. She noted lower extremity edema and facial swelling that was gradually increasing. She has gestational hypertension and, 1 week ago, was prescribed labetalol 200 mg twice a day. On initial presentation, her blood pressure was 190/110 mm Hg on 2 separate occasions, 5 minutes apart. She had gained 2 kilograms since her last antenatal checkup in the clinic a week ago. The patient was diagnosed with severe preeclampsia. The senior obstetric resident ordered a loading dose of magnesium sulfate to prevent imminent seizure. The hospital protocol used an intravenous (IV) and intramuscular (IM) regimen where the patient received a 4 g IV bolus and a 10 g IM dose administered as 5 g in each buttock. The senior resident gave verbal orders for magnesium sulfate administration to the junior resident, who verbally communicated the order to the nurse."

        "title": "Diuretic abuse and central pontine myelinolysis.",
        "content": "Patients with eating disorders often use diuretics to eliminate fluid to achieve lower body weight. Diuretic abuse can lead to severe hyponatremia. Central pontine myelinolysis, a disruption of the myelinated neurons of the pons, has been associated with rapid correction of severe hyponatremia. A case is presented of a 35-year-old woman who was brought to the emergency service by ambulance complaining of vomiting for 7 days and that she could not hear well because she was 'worn out'. Initial laboratory values included serum Na 91 mEq/l, K 1.6, Cl 46, bicarbonate 33, BUN 4 mg/dl, glucose 306 mg/dl. After 32 h of intravenous fluids, the serum Na was 126, K 4.0, Cl 89, bicarbonate 25, glucose 118 mg/dl. On the 3rd hospital day the serum Na was 139. On the 4th hospital day she was alert and appropriate. On the 5th hospital day, however, she was confabulating and chatty. The serum Na was 139. She progressed to develop a spastic quadriparesis, speech and swallowing difficulties. A magnetic resonance imaging scan showed central pontine myelinolysis. She acknowledged taking 400 mg daily of furosemide and drinking much water. She had a past history of anorexia nervosa. She had a residual weight phobia and strove to keep her weight below 106 lb. Her height was 5 feet, 6 inches. As illustrated by this case, diuretic abuse can cause severe hyponatremia and the subsequent risk of central pontine myelinolysis. In patients with severe chronic or subacute hyponatremia, a safe restoration rate for serum Na has been less than 0.55 mEq/l/h. Serum Na should be below 135 within the first 48 h and hypernatremia should be avoided.",

        "content": "A 63-year-old white woman was admitted to the hospital for bilateral total knee arthroplasty. She was given prophylactic subcutaneous heparin therapy postoperatively. Three days later, she had a brief hypotensive episode and an unexplained drop in hemoglobin level. Seven days postoperatively, she became confused and disoriented while complaining of pain in her right side and, later, under her left breast. She also had nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and a vague feeling of \"illness.\" Her condition deteriorated progressively, with blood pressure falling to 65/40 mm Hg and a temperature of 39.7 degrees C. Blood, urine, and cerebrospinal-fluid culture samples showed no evidence of infection. A diagnosis of acute adrenal insufficiency was made. Following corticosteroid therapy, the patient's condition improved markedly. Of interest in our patient was that she had had no antecedent hypotension, sepsis, fever, or surgical complications. Acute adrenal hemorrhage is often overlooked because the symptoms are attributed to other conditions, especially to sepsis. Acute adrenal hemorrhage should be suspected in any stressed patient in whom an abrupt deterioration associated with back or abdominal pain, hypotension, and unexplained fever are noted. Suspicion should be raised regarding those patients who are receiving anticoagulant therapy (including subcutaneous heparin prophylaxis) at the time of deterioration. With increased awareness, more cases of acute bilateral adrenal hemorrhage and subsequent adrenal insufficiency can be recognized ante mortem and treated.",

        "content": "A 42-year-old woman was admitted because of cough, sputum, and fever. A chest roentgenogram revealed a nodular density in the left upper lung field with satellite lesions compatible with tuberculoma. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was detected from sputum. Five weeks after starting the treatment with 0.4 g/day of isoniazid, 0.45 g/day of rifampicin, and 0.75 g/day of streptomycin, she showed itching erythema in the trunk. The white blood cell count was 4,500/mm3 with 14% eosinophils, and serum transaminases were slightly increased (GOT 101 U/L, GPT 74 U/L). Although isoniazid and rifampicin were stopped, the erythema with exfoliation spread to her extremities, suggesting exfoliative dermatitis. The white blood cell count reached 15,990/mm3 with 68% eosinophils (10,810/mm3). Stimulation indices measured with the lymphocyte stimulation test (LST) were 109% with rifampicin, 140% with isoniazid, and 275% with streptomycin, suggesting streptomycin-induced allergy. After cessation of streptomycin, the symptoms gradually improved. After the reaction had subsided, the treatment with isoniazid, rifampicin, and ethambutol was resumed, but she showed no further adverse reactions. LST seems to be very useful to identify the drug or drugs responsible for the reactions occurred during the treatment by antituberculosis drugs.",

        "content": "A 53-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital on Nov. 16, 1987, because of general fatigue. On admission, she had hepatosplenomegaly and her peripheral blood profile showed a white blood cell count (WBC) of 309 x 10(3)/microliters with immature neutrophils, a hemoglobin level (Hb) of 7.6 g/dl, platelet count (PLT) of 536 x 10(3)/microliters, neutrophilic alkaline phosphatase (NAP) score of 44. Both Vitamin B12 and LDH levels were high. The bone marrow showed marked myeloid hyperplasia. In a cytogenetic study, Ph1 was found in 3 of 8 metaphases and Ph1 with an additional abnormality of 8 trisomy was noted in 5 of 8 metaphases. She was diagnosed as having chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and treated by i.m. injection of interferon (IFN)-alpha at a daily dose of 6 x 10(6) U. Administration of IFN-alpha induced fever for a few days. WBC, PLT count and LDH level gradually decreased, and the NAP score and hepatosplenomegaly improved. She achieved remission in February, 1988. Administration of IFN-alpha was stopped in April, 1988, when the bone marrow showed hypocellularity and normal karyotype. She was treated with 20 mg of prednisolone daily from May until August, because of progressive pancytopenia. She had received no treatment until July, 1989. In May, 1989, the bone marrow again showed myeloid hyperplasia and Ph1 was found in all cells analyzed. Therefore, we resumed IFN-alpha treatment. It is interesting that remission of CML continues for more than one year after discontinuation of IFN-alpha in this case.",
