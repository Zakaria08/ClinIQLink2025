Document 1 (Title: Paget's disease of bone): Diagnosis The first clinical manifestation of Paget's disease is usually an elevated alkaline phosphatase in the blood. Paget's disease may be diagnosed using one or more of the following tests: Pagetic bone has a characteristic appearance on X-rays. A skeletal survey is therefore indicated. An elevated level of alkaline phosphatase in the blood in combination with normal calcium, phosphate, and aminotransferase levels in an elderly patient are suggestive of Paget's disease. Markers of bone turnover in urine eg. Pyridinoline Elevated levels of serum and urinary hydroxyproline are also found. Bone scans are useful in determining the extent and activity of the condition. If a bone scan suggests Paget's disease, the affected bone(s) should be X-rayed to confirm the diagnosis. Differential diagnosis
Document 2 (Title: Osteomalacia): Causes The causes of adult osteomalacia are varied, but ultimately result in a vitamin D deficiency: Diagnosis Biochemical findings Biochemical features are similar to those of rickets. The major factor is an abnormally low vitamin D concentration in blood serum. Major typical biochemical findings include: Low serum and urinary calcium Low serum phosphate, except in cases of renal osteodystrophy Elevated serum alkaline phosphatase (due to an increase in compensatory osteoblast activity) Elevated parathyroid hormone (due to low calcium) Furthermore, a technetium bone scan will show increased activity (also due to increased osteoblasts). Radiographic characteristics Radiological appearances include: Pseudofractures, also called Looser's zones. Protrusio acetabuli, a hip joint disorder
Document 3 (Title: Acid Phosphatase -- Clinical Significance -- Acid Phosphatase as a Marker): Bone tissue is a dynamic structure that is continuously formed and resorbed in a balanced process. Osteoclasts, the cells responsible for bone resorption, express another acid phosphatase isoform. Indeed, several studies have shown that acid phosphatase is directly involved in bone resorption. Bone acid phosphatase differs from prostatic acid phosphatase in being a tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase. In osteoporosis, the most common bone disease in humans, the resorption/formation balance becomes disrupted in favor of resorption. Several serum markers for bone resorption have been proposed, such as urinary hydroxyproline, total urinary pyridinoline, and bone sialoprotein. Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase is precise, resistant to hemolysis, and shows minimal day-to-day variability, making it a potential marker for monitoring therapy response, though it is still under development. In addition, agents that inhibit tartrate-resistant acid phosphatases, such as fluoride, have been shown to improve and even rev...
Document 4 (Title: [Usefulness of bone remodelling biochemical markers in the diagnosis and follow-up of Paget's bone disease, primary hyperparathyroidism, tumor hypercalcemia, and postmenopausal osteoporosis. II. Bone resorption markers].): Rapid detection of the exact changes in bone remodelling is exceptionally important. In this paper, the latest bone remodelling biochemical markers are reviewed. Some of them have already been used for a long time, and their utility has been widely demonstrated. The newest ones, in experimental stage, can be used as a complement to the others. The bone remodelling markers reviewed are: 1) Alkaline phosphatase; 2) osteocalcin; 3) other noncollagen of bone matrix such as osteonectin, GLA-protein of the matrix, osteopontine and alpha 2-HS-glycoprotein; 4) Procollagenous and other collagenous peptides of the matrix (C terminal of type I procollagen and urinary elimination of non-dialysis hydroxyproline. Amongst the bone resorption markers studied are: 1) Calcium/creatinine urinary quotient; 2) Tartrate resistant acid phosphatase; 3) Urinary hydroxyproline; 4) Other substance derived from collagen disruption such as hydroxylysine glycoside, piridinolinic intermolecular bridges and the enzymatic activity of proline...
Document 5 (Title: Acid phosphatase): Certain bacteria like Nocardia, can degrade this enzyme and utilize it as a carbon source. Bone acid phosphatase Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase may be used as a biochemical marker of osteoclast function during the process of bone resorption. Genes The following genes encode the polypeptide components for various acid phosphatase isoenzymes. ACP1 ACP2 ACPP (ACP3), Prostatic acid phosphatase ACP5, Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase ACP6 ACPT, Testicular acid phosphatase Tissue acid phosphatase, or Lysosomal acid phosphatase See also Alkaline phosphatase References External links EC 3.1.3.2 Biochemistry
