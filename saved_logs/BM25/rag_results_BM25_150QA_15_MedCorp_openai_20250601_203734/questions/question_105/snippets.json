A patient with small cell lung cancer scores one point for each of the following: - Serum lactate dehydrogenase exceeds the upper limit of the reference range. Serum sodium concentration less than 132 mmol/l. Serum alkaline phosphatase over one-and-a-half times the upper limit of the reference range. Serum bicarbonate less than 24. Karnofsky performance status less than 60. Extensive stage disease. Prognosis References Lung cancer",
