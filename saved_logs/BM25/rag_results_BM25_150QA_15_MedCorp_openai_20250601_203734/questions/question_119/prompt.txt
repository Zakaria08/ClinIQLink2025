Document 1 (Title: Primary standard): Arsenic trioxide for making sodium arsenite solution for standardisation of sodium periodate solution (until Ph. Eur. 3, Appendix 2001 also for iodine and cerium(IV) sulfate solutions, since Ph. Eur. 4, 2002 standardised by sodium thiosulfate) Benzoic acid for standardisation of waterless basic solutions: ethanolic sodium and potassium hydroxide, TBAH, and alkali methanolates in methanol, isopropanol, or DMF Potassium bromate (KBrO3) for standardisation of sodium thiosulfate solutions Potassium hydrogen phthalate (usually called KHP) for standardisation of aqueous base and perchloric acid in acetic acid solutions Sodium carbonate for standardisation of aqueous acids: hydrochloric, sulfuric acid and nitric acid solutions (but not acetic acid) Sodium chloride for standardisation of silver nitrate solutions Sulfanilic acid for standardisation of sodium nitrite solutions Zinc powder, after being dissolved in sulfuric or hydrochloric acid, for standardization of EDTA solutions
Document 2 (Title: Fluoroboric acid): Aqueous solutions of HBF4 are produced by dissolving boric acid in aqueous hydrofluoric acid. Three equivalents of HF react to give the intermediate boron trifluoride and the fourth gives fluoroboric acid: B(OH)3 + 4 HF → H3O+ + + 2 H2O Anhydrous solutions can be prepared by treatment of aqueous fluoroboric acid with acetic anhydride. Acidity The acidity of fluoroboric acid is complicated by the fact that the name refers to several different species H(OEt2)+BF, H3O+BF, and HF.BF3 – each with a different acidity. The aqueous pKa is quoted as −0.44. Titration of NBuBF in acetonitrile solution indicates that HBF4, i.e., HF.BF3, has a pKa of 1.6 in that solvent. Its acidity is thus comparable to that of fluorosulfonic acid.
Document 3 (Title: Lead(II) acetate): An aqueous solution of lead(II) acetate is the byproduct of a 1:1 ratio of hydrogen peroxide and white vinegar (acetic acid) used in the cleaning and maintenance of stainless steel firearm suppressors (silencers) and compensators. The solution is agitated by the bubbling action of the hydrogen peroxide, and the main reaction is the dissolution of lead deposits within the suppressor by the acetic acid, which forms lead acetate. Because of its high toxicity, this chemical solution must be appropriately disposed by a chemical processing facility or hazardous materials centre. Alternatively, the solution may be reacted with sulfuric acid to precipitate nearly insoluble lead(II) sulfate. The solid may then be removed by mechanical filtration and is safer to dispose of than aqueous lead acetate. It was also used in making of slow matches during the Middle Ages. It was made by mixing natural form of lead(II) oxide called litharge and vinegar.
Document 4 (Title: Conjugate acid): A second common application with an organic compound would be the production of a buffer with acetic acid. If acetic acid, a weak acid with the formula , was made into a buffer solution, it would need to be combined with its conjugate base in the form of a salt. The resulting mixture is called an acetate buffer, consisting of aqueous and aqueous . Acetic acid, along with many other weak acids, serve as useful components of buffers in different lab settings, each useful within their own pH range. Ringer's lactate solution is an example where the conjugate base of an organic acid, lactic acid, is combined with sodium, calcium and potassium cations and chloride anions in distilled water which together form a fluid which is isotonic in relation to human blood and is used for fluid resuscitation after blood loss due to trauma, surgery, or a burn injury.
Document 5 (Title: Acid): Common aqueous acids include hydrochloric acid (a solution of hydrogen chloride which is found in gastric acid in the stomach and activates digestive enzymes), acetic acid (vinegar is a dilute aqueous solution of this liquid), sulfuric acid (used in car batteries), and citric acid (found in citrus fruits). As these examples show, acids (in the colloquial sense) can be solutions or pure substances, and can be derived from acids (in the strict sense) that are solids, liquids, or gases. Strong acids and some concentrated weak acids are corrosive, but there are exceptions such as carboranes and boric acid.
