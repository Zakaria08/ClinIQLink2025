Document 1 (Title: Mass diffusivity): where D is the diffusion coefficient, T1 and T2 are the corresponding absolute temperatures, μ is the dynamic viscosity of the solvent. Gases The dependence of the diffusion coefficient on temperature for gases can be expressed using Chapman–Enskog theory (predictions accurate on average to about 8%): where D is the diffusion coefficient (cm2/s), A is an empirical coefficient equal to 1 and 2 index the two kinds of molecules present in the gaseous mixture, T is the absolute temperature (K), M is the molar mass (g/mol), p is the pressure (atm), is the average collision diameter (the values are tabulated page 545) (Å), Ω is a temperature-dependent collision integral (the values are tabulated but usually of order 1) (dimensionless). Pressure dependence of the diffusion coefficient For self-diffusion in gases at two different pressures (but the same temperature), the following empirical equation has been suggested:
Document 2 (Title: Molecular diffusion): In case of an ideal mix, the particle diffusion equation holds true and the diffusion coefficient D the speed of diffusion in the particle diffusion equation is independent of particle concentration. In other cases, resulting interactions between particles within the solvent will account for the following effects: the diffusion coefficient D in the particle diffusion equation becomes dependent of concentration. For an attractive interaction between particles, the diffusion coefficient tends to decrease as concentration increases. For a repulsive interaction between particles, the diffusion coefficient tends to increase as concentration increases. In the case of an attractive interaction between particles, particles exhibit a tendency to coalesce and form clusters if their concentration lies above a certain threshold. This is equivalent to a precipitation chemical reaction (and if the considered diffusing particles are chemical molecules in solution, then it is a precipitation).
Document 3 (Title: Flux): These fluxes are vectors at each point in space, and have a definite magnitude and direction. Also, one can take the divergence of any of these fluxes to determine the accumulation rate of the quantity in a control volume around a given point in space. For incompressible flow, the divergence of the volume flux is zero. Chemical diffusion As mentioned above, chemical molar flux of a component A in an isothermal, isobaric system is defined in Fick's law of diffusion as: where the nabla symbol ∇ denotes the gradient operator, DAB is the diffusion coefficient (m2·s−1) of component A diffusing through component B, cA is the concentration (mol/m3) of component A. This flux has units of mol·m−2·s−1, and fits Maxwell's original definition of flux. For dilute gases, kinetic molecular theory relates the diffusion coefficient D to the particle density n = N/V, the molecular mass m, the collision cross section , and the absolute temperature T by

Document 5 (Title: Mass diffusivity): Diffusivity, mass diffusivity or diffusion coefficient is a proportionality constant between the molar flux due to molecular diffusion and the gradient in the concentration of the species (or the driving force for diffusion). Diffusivity is encountered in Fick's law and numerous other equations of physical chemistry. The diffusivity is generally prescribed for a given pair of species and pairwise for a multi-species system. The higher the diffusivity (of one substance with respect to another), the faster they diffuse into each other. Typically, a compound's diffusion coefficient is ~10,000× as great in air as in water. Carbon dioxide in air has a diffusion coefficient of 16 mm2/s, and in water its diffusion coefficient is 0.0016 mm2/s. Diffusivity has dimensions of length2 / time, or m2/s in SI units and cm2/s in CGS units. Temperature dependence of the diffusion coefficient
