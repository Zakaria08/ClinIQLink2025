Document 1 (Title: UTP—glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase): In higher animals, the enzyme is highly active in tissues involved in glycogenesis, including the liver and the muscles. An exception is the brain, which has high levels of glycogen but low specific activity of UTP—glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase. In animal cells, UTP—glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase is found predominantly in the cytoplasm. UTP—glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase is also required for galactose metabolism in animals and microorganisms. In galactose metabolism, the enzyme galactose 1-phosphate uridylyltransferase transfers a phosphate from UDP-glucose to galactose 1-phosphate to produce UDP-galactose, which is then converted to UDP-glucose. Bacteria with defective UTP—glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase are unable to incorporate galactose into their cell walls.
Document 2 (Title: Glucokinase): Because of this cooperativity, the kinetic interaction of glucokinase with glucose does not follow classical Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Rather than a Km for glucose, it is more accurate to describe a half-saturation level S0.5, which is the concentration at which the enzyme is 50% saturated and active. The S0.5 and nH extrapolate to an "inflection point" of the curve describing enzyme activity as a function of glucose concentration at about 4 mmol/L. In other words, at a glucose concentration of about 72 mg/dL, which is near the low end of the normal range, glucokinase activity is most sensitive to small changes in glucose concentration.
Document 3 (Title: Enzyme activator): Examples Hexokinase-I Hexokinase-I (HK-I) is an enzyme activator because it draws glucose into the glycolysis pathway. Its function is to phosphorylate glucose releasing glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) as the product. HK-I not only signals the activation of glucose into glycolysis but also maintains a low glucose concentration to facilitate glucose diffusion into the cell. It has two catalytic domains (N-terminal domain and C-terminal domain) which are connected through an α-helix. The N-terminal acts as an allosteric regulator of C-terminal; the C-terminal is the only one involved in the catalytic activity. HK-I is regulated by the concentration of G6P, where G6P acts as a feedback inhibitor. At low G6P concentration, HK-I is activated; at high G6P concentration, the HK-I is inhibited.
Document 4 (Title: Abductive logic programming): Domain knowledge (P) feed(lactose) :- make(permease), make(galactosidase). make(Enzyme) :- code(Gene, Enzyme), express(Gene). express(lac(X)) :- amount(glucose, low), amount(lactose, hi). express(lac(X)) :- amount(glucose, medium), amount(lactose, medium). code(lac(y), permease). code(lac(z), galactosidase). temperature(low) :- amount(glucose, low). Integrity constraints (IC) false :- amount(S, V1), amount(S, V2), V1 ≠ V2. Abducibles (A) abducible_predicate(amount). The problem goal is . This can arise either as an observation to be explained or as a state of affairs to be achieved by finding a plan. This goal has two abductive explanations:
Document 5 (Title: Abductive logic programming): Example 3 The abductive logic program below describes a simple model of the lactose metabolism of the bacterium E. coli. The program, P, describes (in its first rule) that E. coli can feed on the sugar lactose if it makes two enzymes permease and galactosidase. Like all enzymes, these are made if they are coded by a gene (Gene) that is expressed (described by the second rule). The two enzymes of permease and galactosidase are coded by two genes, lac(y) and lac(z) respectively (stated in the fifth and sixth rule of the program), in a cluster of genes (lac(X)) – called an operon – that is expressed when the amounts (amt) of glucose are low and lactose are high or when they are both at medium level (see the fourth and fifth rule). The abducibles, A, declare all ground instances of the predicates "amount" as assumable. This reflects that in the model the amounts at any time of the various substances are unknown. This is incomplete information that is to be determined in each problem case.

Question: A researcher is studying the properties of an enzyme that adds phosphate groups to glucose. She discovers that the enzyme is present in most body tissues and is located in the cytoplasm of the cells expressing the enzyme. She decides to mix this enzyme under subphysiologic conditions with varying levels of glucose in order to determine the kinetic properties of the enzyme. Specifically, she adds increasing levels of glucose at a saturating concentration of phosphate and sees that the rate at which glucose becomes phosphorylated gets faster at higher levels of glucose. She observes that this rate approaches a maximum speed and calls this speed Y. She then determines the concentration of glucose that is needed to make the enzyme function at half the speed Y and calls this concentration X. Which of the following is most likely true about the properties of this enzyme?
Options:
A. High X and high Y
B. High X and low Y
C. Low X and high Y
D. Low X and low Y
