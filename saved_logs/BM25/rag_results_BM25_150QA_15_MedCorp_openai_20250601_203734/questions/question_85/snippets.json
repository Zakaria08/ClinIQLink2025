Effectiveness The Pap test, when combined with a regular program of screening and appropriate follow-up, can reduce cervical cancer deaths by up to 80%. Failure of prevention of cancer by the Pap test can occur for many reasons, including not getting regular screening, lack of appropriate follow-up of abnormal results, and sampling and interpretation errors. In the US, over half of all invasive cancers occur in females who have never had a Pap smear; an additional 10 to 20% of cancers occur in those who have not had a Pap smear in the preceding five years. About one-quarter of US cervical cancers were in people who had an abnormal Pap smear but did not get appropriate follow-up (patient did not return for care, or clinician did not perform recommended tests or treatment).",

A profile of patients with hyperkeratosis was constructed by comparing them to an age-matched control population having normal Papanicolaou smears. The clinical significance of hyperkeratosis was evaluated and appropriate follow-up studies were recommended. Of 2198 Papanicolaou smears done in the University of Kansas Family Practice Department between October 1, 1988, and October 31, 1989, there were 184 diagnoses of hyperkeratosis from smears on which no other pathological findings were noted. Charts of 183 of these patients with hyperkeratosis were reviewed and compared with an age-matched control population having normal Papanicolaou smears. Patients with hyperkeratosis had a statistically higher incidence of infections with Gardnerella vaginalis, but a lower incidence of infections with Chlamydia trachomatis. Diaphragm use was more prevalent in the group with hyperkeratosis. The incidence of inflammation on Papanicolaou smear was similar between the two groups. Of the patients with hyperkeratosis, colposcopic examination had been performed on 48% (88 of 183), of which 28% (25 of 88) had evidence of human papillomavirus or dysplasia. Review of the data obtained suggests that follow-up colposcopy, including endocervical curettage, be performed on all patients with hyperkeratosis in order to screen for accompanying pathological conditions that may necessitate treatment.",

        "title": "Papanicolaou smear abnormalities in ambulatory care sites for women infected with the human immunodeficiency virus.",
        "content": "We attempted to determine the prevalence of cervical dysplasia in human immunodeficiency virus-infected women in ambulatory care settings and to correlate Papanicolaou smears with demographic and clinical variables. Papanicolaou smears of 135 women attending three ambulatory care clinics were reviewed. Chart review identified demographic and clinical variables, including CD4 count. Prevalence of abnormal smears was compared with baseline community rates. Demographic and clinical variables were correlated with Papanicolaou results with the chi 2 test. Fivefold to eightfold increased rates of abnormal smears in human immunodeficiency virus-infected women were observed. Prevalence of abnormal smears increased from 21% in women with CD4 counts greater than 600/mm3 to 45% in women with CD4 counts less than 400/mm3. Age, ethnicity, or mode of human immunodeficiency virus transmission was not significantly correlated with Papanicolaou smear findings. Increased rates of abnormal Papanicolaou smears and significant correlation with CD4 counts were observed in human immunodeficiency virus-infected women at ambulatory care sites. We recommend comprehensive gynecologic care, including semiannual Papanicolaou smears, for all human immunodeficiency virus-infected women.",

        "title": "Significance of anucleated squames in Papanicolaou-stained cervicovaginal smears.",
        "content": "The significance of anucleated squames in Papanicolaou-stained cervicovaginal smears as a marker of hyperkeratosis with an underlying significant atypia was evaluated. Over a two-year period, 785 (0.47%) of 168,215 cervicovaginal smears were signed out as demonstrating anucleated squames without any other abnormality. Cytologic or histologic follow-up specimens were available for 304 of those smears (42%). Histology or cytology showed condyloma or a more significant lesion in 13 cases (4.3%); histology showed hyperkeratosis without atypia in 25 cases (8.2%) and chronic cervicitis in 23 (7.5%); follow-up cytology demonstrated persistent anucleated squames in 47 cases (15.4%) and was negative in 196 (64.6%). During this same period, the rate of condyloma or a more significant lesion in all Papanicolaou smears examined was 1.69%. Thus, reporting the presence of anucleated squames in the absence of any other abnormality appears to be of marginal value as a screening procedure for predicting the existence of a significant lesion. Noting their presence in patients with a prior diagnosis of condyloma or dysplasia remains an important tool for detecting a persistent lesion. Lack of standardization among pathologists in the recognition of anucleated squames may partially explain the low predictive value of this finding: an informally conducted survey revealed a mean accuracy of 46% in the identification of true anucleated squames.",
