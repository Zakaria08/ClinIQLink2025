        "content": "In an investigation of child-rearing styles maternal use of \"positive contact\" was measured by asking the mother how often she played with the child, praised the child, and the like, and combining the responses into a score. Home observations on a sample of families revealed that mothers scoring above the mean used fewer communications in the form of directives and \"unmodified power\" and more communication in the form of praise and social conversation than mothers scoring below the mean. The mother's use of positive contact was related to her educational level, the birth order of the child and number of children in the family, the father's use of positive contact, and to a friendly outgoing pattern of child behavior. There was no relation to the mother's use of physical punishment, her protectiveness, her tendency to comply with the child's demands, or her child-rearing ideology and other attitudes. Child care workers are in a strategic position to educate parents about the importance of this kind of contact, especially with later-born children in large families.",

        "content": "Little has been written about the perceptions of expectant mothers with previous histories of psychiatric disturbance and their affective oscillations during pregnancy. This paper discusses the case of a 22-year-old primigravida with a history of schizoaffective disorder who was referred to our mother-infant psychotherapy service. Despite the patient's initial defensive style, she was asked to discuss several dreams that she had had since learning about her pregnancy. A wealth of information about the patient's unconscious ambivalence and destructive wishes toward her unborn infant emerged. The patient was also unable to engage in any predictive imagery about the future of her infant or to anticipate intuitively what the experience of mothering would be like. This paper reveals that pregnant women with a history of psychological disturbances often have highly aberrational fantasies and ambivalent impulses toward their unborn infant, and some of these fantasies threaten to manifest in the form of abusive behavior after the birth. Techniques for predicting how new mothers with previous psychiatric histories will interact with their infants after birth are outlined. It is hoped that this treatment may avert child abuse.",

She had experienced no menstruation until she had treatment with gestagen in her early twenties. She had withdrawal bleeding only once. At the age of 25, she consulted her family doctor, complaining of amenorrhea. Estrogen progesterone cyclic therapy caused withdrawal bleeding, and clomiphene citrate failed to induce apparent ovulation. In January 1978, 150 IU of hMG was administered daily for 9 days, and then 3000 IU of hCG daily for the following 2 days. This therapy induced pregnancy, which failed spontaneously on June 4th. A year later, in January 1979, 150 IU of hMG was again administered daily for 7 days followed by 6000 IU of hCG for 3 days. This therapy again induced pregnancy. On September 27th, 1979, she delivered a girl vaginally, weighing 3830 g. After this delivery, she experienced no menstruation. In June 1985, she consulted her family doctor again, and she was diagnosed as being pregnant.

        "content": "Princess Marie Bonaparte was a colorful yet mysterious member of Freud's inner circle of psychoanalysis. In analysis with Freud beginning in 1925 (she was then 45 years old), she became a lay analyst and writer of many papers and books. Her most ambitious task was a 700-page psychobiography of Edgar Allan Poe that was first published in French in 1933. She was fascinated by Poe's gothic stories--with the return to life of dead persons and the eerie, unexpected turns of events. Her fascination with Poe can be traced to the similarity of their early traumatic life experiences. Bonaparte had lost her mother a month after her birth. Poe's father deserted the family when Edgar was two years old, and his mother died of tuberculosis when he was three. Poe's stories helped him to accommodate to these early traumatic losses. Bonaparte vicariously shared in Poe's loss and the fantasies of the return of the deceased parent in his stories. She was sensitive and empathetic to Poe's inner world because her inner world was similar. The result of this psychological fit between Poe and Bonaparte was her psychobiography, The Life and Works of Edgar Allan Poe. It was a milestone in psychobiography but limited in its psychological scope by its strong emphasis on early childhood trauma. Nevertheless it proved Bonaparte a bona fide creative psychoanalyst and not a dilettante propped up by her friendship with Freud.",

[9] A case report described a 43-year-old male with NF1 whose one of the sisters had multiple LNs, while her elder daughter had only one LN. Neither of these 2 patients had any signs of cutaneous or systemic neurofibromatosis. Therefore, LNs are the ocular marker of NF1 in otherwise normal family members of patients with NF1.

        "content": "A 69-year-old white Italian woman was first seen at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in 1981 concerning several skin growths on her back. The patient had had several basal cell carcinomas surgically removed from her back during the preceding 5 years. There was no history of arsenic ingestion or prolonged sun exposure and her family history was negative for skin cancer. The patient had developed pulmonary tuberculosis in 1938 and was treated with pneumothorax therapy. She had had more than 50 fluoroscopic examinations of the chest following this therapy, as well as multiple diagnostic x-ray films since that time. She recalled that she had faced the fluoroscopy beam during the procedure. In 1959, she had a transabdominal hysterectomy for fibroid tumors. In 1980 she underwent a right modified radical mastectomy for adenoid cystic carcinoma of the breast; biopsies of lymph nodes were negative. Physical examination revealed a thin, white woman with a right mastectomy scar. On the back, clustered in the interscapular region, were multiple scars and nine erythematous nodules with pearly borders, telangiectasia, and translucent surfaces. Within several nodules there were areas of light and dark brown pigmentation. There were no other suspicious lesions on the head, chest, or extremities, nor did the patient show any evidence of the basal cell nevus syndrome. Biopsy of all lesions revealed basal cell carcinoma, some of which were pigmented, without evidence of chronic radiodermatitis. All lesions were treated with curettage and electrodesiccation three times with good cosmetic results (Fig. 1).",

        "content": "Anna Rose is a survivor of childhood emotional, physical, and sexual abuse. Much of the abuse was \"submerged\" until her mid-thirties, when she was pregnant with her second child, and finally began to remember and deal with the realities of what had happened to her. During her second pregnancy, Anna wrote, \"It has taken me more than three years to even begin to deal with the rage I feel about my first birth experience, even though I have been in therapy most of that time. Now that I am pregnant again, the unresolved issues are coming to the surface, and intense fears that this birth will be a repeat of the first.\" Anna's first child, Elliot, was born in 1987 in a hospital birthing room in the northeastern United States. Her husband Paul, a younger sister, and a close friend were present, and she was attended by an obstetrician named Bernie. She describes that birth as \"19 hours of hard labor, absolutely exhausting and unmanageable, which required drugs at some point to let me sleep for a few hours.\" Labor was induced by Pitocin due to premature rupture of membranes and lack of effective contractions after 12 hours. Continuous electronic fetal monitoring was used throughout labor. Anna breastfed Elliot for three years, and found La Leche League \"extremely helpful and supportive\" during that time. Tom, Anna's second child, was born at home in 1991. Two midwives attended the birth after she changed caregivers during the pregnancy because she \"did not feel safe enough\" with the obstetrician and nurse-midwife team she had chosen for this birth. She maintained the team as backup, although they did not know of her plans for a home birth. Her second labor lasted under 6 hours, was noninterventive, and \"incredibly intense and painful, partly due to the abuse memories that were coming up and getting in the way and partly due to the baby's position.\" We thank Anna Rose for sharing her story with Birth. Her reason for doing so is, in her words, because, \"I feel strongly that it is important to share this information in an effort to educate health care professionals so that other women may be helped.\"",
