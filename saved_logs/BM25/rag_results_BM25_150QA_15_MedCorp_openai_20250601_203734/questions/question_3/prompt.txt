Document 1 (Title: [Child abuse: report of three cases].): Child abuse, a clinical condition in young children who have received serious physical abuse, is a frequent cause of permanent injury or death. The first case is a 7-year-old boy suffering from abdominal distension and pain for 3 days. He was beaten by his mother as a result of inadequately learning his lessons. Sonogram and CT of the abdomen showed massive ascites and a pseudocyst of the pancreatic body about 3 x 3 cm in diameter. The second case is a 4-year-old girl who developed a semicomatose state after her father impulsively struck her with a chair. CT of the brain revealed subdural hematoma over the left fronto-temporal region and midline shift to the right. She expired 5 days later. The third case, a 2-year-old girl, suffered from headache, seizure, vomiting and general malaise. CT of the brain showed severe brain swelling over the right side and midline shift to the left. She expired 1 month later. Psychiatric factors are probably of prime importance in the pathogenesis of the disorder, but our knowl...
Document 2 (Title: Annular pancreas): Causes It is typically associated with abnormal embryological development, however adult cases can develop. It can result from growth of a bifid ventral pancreatic bud around the duodenum, where the parts of the bifid ventral bud fuse with the dorsal bud, forming a pancreatic ring. It can also result if the ventral pancreatic bud fails to fully rotate, so it remains on the right or if the dorsal bud rotates in the wrong direction, such that the duodenum is surrounded by pancreatic tissue. Blockage of the duodenum develops if inflammation (pancreatitis) develops in the annular pancreas.
Document 3 (Title: [Long-term nasogastric feeding and complications of acute gastric ulcer in two elderly patients].): Some elderly patients with chronic illness such as stroke, or Parkinsonism cannot take food orally because of dysphagia. In such cases, tube feeding can be used as a supplement to oral intake when malnutrition is present. This route allows for easier nursing care and decreases the frequency of aspiration pneumonia. Complications of tube feeding include nutrient deficiency states, pulmonary aspiration, gastrointestinal and metabolic disorders. We report two cases with complications of acute gastric ulcer which was thought to be induced with long-term tube feeding. Case 1 was a 61-year-old male patient with Parkinson's disease for ten years. L-DOPA had been administered with good control of his condition. However, his ability to swallow has deteriorated gradually. As he often suffered from aspiration pneumonia, nasogastric tube feeding was performed. After three years of tube feeding, he suddenly vomited much bloody material. He died from massive bleeding with acute gastric dilatation. Autopsy showed giant acut...
Document 4 (Title: Early mother-infant reciprocity.): By three weeks of age, the human neonate demonstrates behaviours which are quite different with an object and with a human interactant. He also demonstrates an expectancy for interaction with his caregiver which has clearly defined limits, as demonstrated behaviourally. In microanalysis of videotape, we saw regularly a set of interactive behaviours which were demonstrable in optimal face-to-face interaction between infants and their mothers. All parts of the infant's body move in smooth circular patterns as he attends to her. His face-to-face attention to her is rhythmic with approach-withdrawal cycling of extremities. The attention phase and build-up to her cues are followed by turning away and a recovery phase in a rhythm of attention-non-attention which seems to define a cyclical homeostatic curve of attention, averaging several cycles per minute. When she violates his expectancy for rhythmic interaction by presenting a still, unresponsive face to him, he becomes visibly concerned, his movements become jer...
Document 5 (Title: [Neonatal gastric necrosis].): Neonatal necrotizing gastritis is rare. It is usually a complication of acute anoxia or shock and its diagnosis is essentially radiological. Case no. 1: a boy was born at the 36th week of a pregnancy complicated by preeclampsia. Perinatal asphyxia necessitated delivery by cesarean section. He presented with neonatal respiratory distress which was complicated by pneumothorax. On the 5th day of life, the abdomen was distended and the newborn had still not been fed. On the 6th day, X-rays showed pneumatosis of the gastric wall associated with pneumoperitoneum. Surgery showed an area of necrosis on the posterior surface of the stomach with a small perforation, which was stitched. The child was fed 5 days later and was in good condition at the age of 6 months. Case no. 2: a girl was born at the 35th week of a pregnancy complicated by asthma during the second trimester. Perinatal asphyxia and abnormal fetal rhythm led to delivery by cesarean section. At 24 hour of life, she vomited blood and fibroscopy confirmed th...

Question: A mother brings her 3-week-old infant to the pediatrician's office because she is concerned about his feeding habits. He was born without complications and has not had any medical problems up until this time. However, for the past 4 days, he has been fussy, is regurgitating all of his feeds, and his vomit is yellow in color. On physical exam, the child's abdomen is minimally distended but no other abnormalities are appreciated. Which of the following embryologic errors could account for this presentation?
Options:
A. Abnormal migration of ventral pancreatic bud
B. Complete failure of proximal duodenum to recanalize
C. Abnormal hypertrophy of the pylorus
D. Failure of lateral body folds to move ventrally and fuse in the midline
