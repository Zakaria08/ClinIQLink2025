One of the most common methods is to embed the active ingredient in an insoluble porous matrix, such that the dissolving drug must make its way out of the matrix before it can be absorbed. In other sustained release formulations the matrix swells to form a gel through which the drug exits. Another method by which sustained release is achieved is through an osmotic controlled-release oral delivery system, where the active compound is encased in a water-permeable membrane with a laser drilled hole at one end.

Monitoring of in-vitro theophylline release over 12 h, under identical hydrodynamic conditions, showed that the dissolution rate at pH 1.2 is substantially greater (95% of total drug content released in less than 10 h) than that in phosphate buffers. The maximum release after 12 h was approximately 20 and 30% of total drug content of the tablet at pH 5.4 and 7.4, respectively. However, in vivo bioavailability after oral administration of tablets to rabbits corresponded to over 95% of total drug, compared with the same dose administered intravenously. The retarded drug release during in-vitro dissolution in phosphate buffer was attributed to a possible interaction of phosphate ions with theophylline molecules at the tablet core-coat interface. These findings indicate that both rate and extent of theophylline release from the slow release coated mini-tablets are highly sensitive to phosphate buffers.

Preparation of a stable ORS solution tablet therefore requires protection of moisture adsorbing components from the environment. The present UNICEF ORS mixture compacted easily by direct compression but gave fragile tablets, which were hygroscopic. This can be reduced by film coating the electrolyte component as granules with a resin (Eudragit L), or by simulating direct compression of the glucose as a compression-coating around the precompressed electrolytes. The packaging of compression-coated solution tablets in inexpensive polyethylene bags may lengthen the shelf-life and make the preparation less costly than the currently supplied ORS powders packed in laminated aluminium sachets.
