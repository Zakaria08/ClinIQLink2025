Document 1 (Title: Endocrine system): Gonads The reproductive system begins development at four to five weeks of gestation with germ cell migration. The bipotential gonad results from the collection of the medioventral region of the urogenital ridge. At the five-week point, the developing gonads break away from the adrenal primordium. Gonadal differentiation begins 42 days following conception. Male gonadal development For males, the testes form at six fetal weeks and the sertoli cells begin developing by the eight week of gestation. SRY, the sex-determining locus, serves to differentiate the Sertoli cells. The Sertoli cells are the point of origin for anti-Müllerian hormone. Once synthesized, the anti-Müllerian hormone initiates the ipsilateral regression of the Müllerian tract and inhibits the development of female internal features. At 10 weeks of gestation, the Leydig cells begin to produce androgen hormones. The androgen hormone dihydrotestosterone is responsible for the development of the male external genitalia.
Document 2 (Title: [An emergency cesarean section using general anesthesia for a patient with schizophrenia].): A 27 year-old female in 39th week gestation with schizophrenia underwent an emergency Cesarean section using general anesthesia. A diagnosis of schizophrenia was made two years previously, since then oral anti-psychotic drugs such as chlorpromazine had been given to her. In June 1989 she suddenly became excited and generalized muscle rigidity was observed without any triggering episodes. Her excitement was so marked that we had to administer intramuscular levomepromazine 75 mg and diazepam 10 mg to her, but they failed to sedate her adequately. Emergency Cesarean section was scheduled to overcome this situation. Spinal or epidural anesthesia was not indicated because of her vigorous excitement, and anesthesia was induced with thiopental 350 mg and succinylcholine 40 mg. Induction-delivery time was 12 minutes. Pentazocine 30 mg in combination with nitrous oxide was given for the maintenance of anesthesia. Plasma levomepromazine levels were 46.9 ng.ml-1 in the mother and 11.3 ng.ml-1 in the umbilical vein, resp...
Document 3 (Title: Persistent pulmonary arterial hypertension of the newborn.): Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) characterised by right to left shunting with intense cyanosis is difficult to manage, and in the best of centres carries a 40-60 percent mortality. We report our one year's experience of managing six neonates with PPHN. There were 5 males and 1 female with mean birth weight of 2.59 +/- 0.487 kg and gestation period 39 +/- 2.0 wks and 1 minute Apgar score 2.8 +/- 2.1. Four to six babies were born by cesarean section and 3-6 babies had aspiration pneumonia. All babies presented within 12 hours of age (mean 5.08 +/- 5 hrs) with intense cyanosis and respiratory distress. Diagnosis were confirmed in all by (a) hyperoxia test, (b) simultaneous determination of preductal and postductal paO2 (c) contrast echocardiography and (d) hyperoxia-hyperventilation test. Babies were managed with hyperventilation using mean ventilatory rates of 100 +/- 45 per minute, an inspired oxygen concentration of 100%, peak inspiratory pressures 27 +/- 9 cm of H2O, and expiratory pre...
Document 4 (Title: Risk Management Event Evaluation and Responsibilities -- Issues of Concern -- Patient Handoff): For example, handoff of a patient following the "I-PASS" system would be structured as follows: "This patient is a watcher. Ms. X is a 65-year-old female, anticoagulated on apixaban, who presented to the ED after a mechanical fall. She was neurologically intact, but her head CT showed a subdural hematoma without midline shift, so she was admitted to the ICU. She needs neurological checks every 1 hour and a repeat head CT in 4 hours. Should she have an acute mental status change, please plan to reverse her anticoagulation, consider intubating her and giving hypertonic saline, obtain a STAT head CT, and contact neurosurgery immediately. "After this, the receiving provider would summarize the patient and repeat the action points back to ensure proper understanding.
Document 5 (Title: [A case of significant, non-neoplastic, ovarian hypertestosteronism].): A 24-year-old female with significant ovarian hypertestosteronism, who responded well both to gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist and cyclic administration of estrogen and gestagens in terms of suppressing circulating testosterone levels is reported. The patient's menstrual periods had been regular since menarche at the age of 12 until she became amenorrheic at the age of 20. She visited our facility in November 1988 after receiving three cycles of estrogen and gestagen replacement therapy from a previous physician which caused withdrawal bleeding. Clomiphen citrate reportedly failed to induce apparent ovulation. On her first visit with us, she was 160 cm tall weighing 47 kg with apparent hoarseness but not with hirsutism. Pelvic examination revealed significant clitoromegaly but otherwise normal external and internal genitalia. Laparoscopic examination disclosed that her uterus appeared to be normal with bilateral ovaries relatively small (4 x 4 x 3 cm) without tumorous or polycystic appearance. Hi...

Question: A 31-year-old G2P2 female at 40 weeks gestation presents to the hospital following a rush of water that came from her vagina. She is 4 cm dilated and 80% effaced. Fetal heart tracing shows a pulse of 155/min with variable decelerations. About 12 hours after presentation, she gives birth to a 6 lb 15 oz baby boy with APGAR scores of 8 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. Which of the following structures is responsible for inhibition of female internal genitalia?
Options:
A. Spermatogonia
B. Allantois
C. Syncytiotrophoblast
D. Sertoli cells
