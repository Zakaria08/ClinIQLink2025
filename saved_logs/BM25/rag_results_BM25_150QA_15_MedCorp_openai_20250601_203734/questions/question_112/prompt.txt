Document 1 (Title: Methotrexate): Mechanism of action Methotrexate is an antimetabolite of the antifolate type. It is thought to affect cancer and rheumatoid arthritis by two different pathways. For cancer, methotrexate competitively inhibits dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), an enzyme that participates in the tetrahydrofolate synthesis. The affinity of methotrexate for DHFR is about 1000-fold that of folate. DHFR catalyses the conversion of dihydrofolate to the active tetrahydrofolate. Folic acid is needed for the de novo synthesis of the nucleoside thymidine, required for DNA synthesis. Also, folate is essential for purine and pyrimidine base biosynthesis, so synthesis will be inhibited. Methotrexate, therefore, inhibits the synthesis of DNA, RNA, thymidylates, and proteins.
Document 2 (Title: Folate transporter 1): Folate transporter 1 is a protein which in humans is encoded by the SLC19A1 gene. Function Transport of folate compounds into mammalian cells can occur via receptor-mediated (see folate receptor 1) or carrier-mediated mechanisms. A functional coordination between these 2 mechanisms has been proposed to be the method of folate uptake in certain cell types. Methotrexate (MTX) is an antifolate chemotherapeutic agent that is actively transported by the carrier-mediated uptake system. RFC1 plays a role in maintaining intracellular concentrations of folate. SLC19A1 has also been shown to transport the immune second messenger 2'3'-cGAMP. Clinical significance
Document 3 (Title: Folate analog nonsubstrates and inhibitors of folylpolyglutamate synthetase as potential cancer chemotherapy drugs.): Folate monoglutamates and classical antifols such as methotrexate (MTX) are converted intracellularly to poly-gamma-glutamyl forms by folylpolyglutamate synthetase (FPGS). Folylpolyglutamates are absolutely essential for cell survival and proliferation. MTX polyglutamates are strongly implicated in the cytotoxic mechanism of this drug. Two new types of antifol could be targeted toward polyglutamate synthesis. One type would be structurally analogous to a folate monoglutamate or MTX, except it would not form polyglutamates. In the case of a folate, this analog might induce cellular deficiency by displacing natural folates. In the case of MTX, the analog might have a therapeutic advantage if MTX polyglutamates are involved primarily in host toxicity. The second approach is through direct inhibitors of FPGS. Two relevant MTX analogs have been synthesized and tested: 4-amino-10-methylpteroyl-4-fluoroglutamate does not form polyglutamates or does so extremely poorly; the second, 4-amino-10-methylpteroyl-2,5-diamin...
Document 4 (Title: Folate analogues. 34. Synthesis and antitumor activity of non-polyglutamylatable inhibitors of dihydrofolate reductase.): Five analogues of methotrextate (MTX), 10-deazaaminopterin (10-DAM), and 10-ethyl-10-deazaaminopterin (10-EDAM) in which the glutamate moiety was replaced by either a gamma-methyleneglutamate or beta-hydroxyglutamate were synthesized and evaluated for their antifolate activity. These analogous are 4-amino-4-deoxy-N10-methylpteroyl-beta-hydroxyglutamic acid (1), 4-amino-4-deoxy-10-deazapteroyl-beta-hydroxyglutamic acid (2), 4-amino-4-deoxy-N10-methylpteroyl-gamma-methyleneglutamic acid (3, MMTX), 4-amino-4-deoxy-10-deazapteroyl-gamma-methyleneglutamic acid (4, MDAM), and 4-amino-4-deoxy-10-ethyl-10-deazapteroyl-gamma-methyleneglutamic acid (5, MEDAM). None of these compounds were metabolized to the respective polyglutamate derivative as judged by their inability to serve as substrates for CCRF-CEM human leukemia cell folylpolyglutamate synthetase (FPGS) in vitro. All compounds inhibited recombinant human-dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) at nearly equivalent magnitude as MTX. Growth-inhibition studies with H35 he...
Document 5 (Title: Serotonin–norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitor): (+)-CPCA ("nocaine") is the 3R,4S piperidine stereoisomer of (phenyltropane based) RTI-31. It is non addictive, although this might be due to it being a NDRI, not a SNDRI. The β-naphthyl analog of "Nocaine" is a SNDRI though in the case of both the SS and RR enantiomers. Consider the piperidine analogs of brasofensine and tesofensine. These were prepared by NeuroSearch (In Denmark) by the chemists Peter Moldt (2002), and Frank Wätjen (2004–2009). There are four separate isomers to consider (SS, RR, S/R and R/S). This is because there are two chiral carbon sites of asymmetry (means 2 to the power of n isomers to consider where n is the number of chiral carbons). They are therefore a diastereo(iso)meric pair of racemers. With a racemic pair of diastereomers, there is still the question of syn (cis) or anti (trans). In the case of the phenyltropanes, although there are four chiral carbons, there are only eight possible isomers to consider. This is based on the fact that the compound is
