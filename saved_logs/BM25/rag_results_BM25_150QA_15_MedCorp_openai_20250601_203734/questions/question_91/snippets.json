This makes it particularly susceptible to impairment from a variety of disorders and conditions. Schizophrenia There is significant evidence that smooth pursuit is deficient in people with schizophrenia and their relatives. People with schizophrenia tend to have trouble pursuing very fast targets. This impairment is correlated with less activation in areas known to play a role in pursuit, such as the frontal eye field. However, other studies have shown that people with schizophrenia show relatively normal pursuit, compared to controls, when tracking objects that move unexpectedly. The greatest deficits are when the patients track objects of a predictable velocity which begin moving at a predictable time.

        "content": "Eye tracking and brain morphology assessed by magnetic resonance imaging were examined in 48 patients in their first episode of schizophrenia and in 15 normal controls. Schizophrenic patients showed higher rates of eye tracking dysfunction and more abnormal brain morphology involving the lateral ventricles, medial temporal lobe (MTL) structures and the frontal-parietal cortex than controls. Enlargement of the lateral ventricles and global rating of abnormal brain morphology were significantly more prevalent in male schizophrenics than female schizophrenics. These findings indicate that abnormalities in a variety of brain regions are present in some schizophrenics during the period shortly after the first hospitalization and could not be a function of treatment or chronic illness. We found no relation between abnormal eye tracking and any single feature of abnormal brain morphology. However, normal eye tracking was significantly associated with MTL abnormalities in schizophrenics, reflecting an inverse association between quality of eye tracking and degree of abnormality in MTL structures. These results suggest that abnormal eye tracking is not mediated by the same processes that lead to structural brain anomalies in schizophrenia.",

        "content": "When a person walks through a rigid environment while holding eyes and head fixed, the pattern of retinal motion flows radially away from a point, the focus of expansion (Fig. 1a). Under such conditions of translation, heading corresponds to the focus of expansion and people identify it readily. But when making an eye/head movement to track an object off to the side, retinal motion is no longer radial (Fig. 1b). Heading perception in such situations has been modelled in two ways. Extra-retinal models monitor the velocity of rotational movements through proprioceptive or efference information from the extraocular and neck muscles and use that information to discount rotation effects. Retinal-image models determine (and eliminate) rotational components from the retinal image alone. These models have been tested by measuring heading perception under two conditions. First, observers judged heading while tracking a point on a simulated ground plane. Second, they fixated a stationary point and the flow field simulated the effects of a tracking eye movement. Extra-retinal models predict poorer performance in the simulated condition because the eyes do not move. Retinal-image models predict no difference in performance because the two conditions produce identical patterns of retinal motion. Warren and Hannon observed similar performance and concluded that people do not require extra-retinal information to judge heading with eye/head movements present, but they used extremely slow tracking eye movements of 0.2-1.2 deg s-1; a moving observer frequently tracks objects at much higher rates (L. Stark, personal communication). Here we examine heading judgements at higher, more typical eye movement velocities and find that people require extra-retinal information about eye position to perceive heading accurately under many viewing conditions.",

        "content": "1. We have investigated the mechanism of a directional deficit in vertical pursuit eye movements in a monkey that was unable to match upward eye speed to target speed but that had pursuit within the normal range for downward or horizontal target motion. Except for a difference in the axis of deficient pursuit, the symptoms in this monkey were similar to those seen with lesions in the frontal or parietal lobes of the cerebral cortex in humans or monkeys. Our evaluation of vertical pursuit in this monkey suggests a new interpretation for the role of the frontal and parietal lobes in pursuit. 2. The up/down asymmetry was most pronounced for target motion at speeds greater than or equal to 2 degree/s. For target motion at 15 or 30 degree/s, upward step-ramp target motion evoked a brief upward smooth eye acceleration, followed by tracking that consisted largely of saccades. Downward step-ramp target motion evoked a prolonged smooth eye acceleration, followed by smooth, accurate tracking. 3. Varying the amplitude of the target step revealed that the deficit was similar for targets moving across all locations of the visual field. Eye acceleration in the interval 0-20 ms after the onset of pursuit was independent of initial target position and was symmetrical for upward and downward target motion. Eye acceleration in the interval 60-80 ms after the onset of pursuit showed a large asymmetry. For upward target motion, eye acceleration in this interval was small and did not depend on initial target position. For downward target motion, eye acceleration depended strongly on initial target position and was large when the target started close to the position of fixation. 4. We next attempted to understand the mechanism of the up/down asymmetry by evaluating the monkey's vertical motion processing and vertical eye movements under a variety of tracking conditions. For spot targets, the response to upward image motion was similar to that in normal monkeys if the image motion was presented during downward pursuit. In addition, the monkey with deficient upward pursuit was able to use upward image motion to make accurate saccades to moving targets. We conclude that the visual processing of upward image motion was normal in this monkey and that an asymmetry in visual motion processing could not account for the deficit in his upward pursuit. 5.

Recordings from single neurons in area V3A of awake macaque monkeys were made to check the existence of such a type of neurons (called 'real-motion' cells; see Galletti et al. 1984, 1988) in this prestriate area of the visual cortex.

In order to assess whether they gave different responses to the movement of a stimulus and to that of its retinal image alone (self-induced by an eye movement while the stimulus was still), a comparison was made between neuronal responses obtained when a moving stimulus swept a stationary receptive field (during steady fixation) and when a moving receptive field swept a stationary stimulus (during tracking eye movement).

        "content": "Several psychophysiological abnormalities associated with schizophrenia have been proposed as genetic trait markers of vulnerability to the disorder. Smooth pursuit eye tracking dysfunction and abnormal long latency event-related potentials are the most promising candidates. Both are independent of the effects of psychotropic medication or mental state at the time of testing, and twin studies demonstrate that each has a high level of heritability. Having recorded smooth pursuit eye tracking and event-related potentials in 20 high-density schizophrenic families, we find abnormalities in one or both measures in most of the families studied. The abnormalities, when present, occur in the family members with schizophrenia and other forms of functional psychosis, and they have a bimodal distribution with approximately half the nonschizophrenic relatives also showing eye tracking dysfunction and/or abnormal event-related potentials. Some of these relatives had psychiatric symptoms; others were normal. Our results suggest that psychophysiological examination can help to clarify the boundaries of schizophrenia spectrum disorder. By helping to decide the phenotypic status of nonschizophrenic family members, this should increase the power of DNA linkage studies.",
        "contents": "Auditory P300 and eye tracking dysfunction in schizophrenic pedigrees. Several psychophysiological abnormalities associated with schizophrenia have been proposed as genetic trait markers of vulnerability to the disorder. Smooth pursuit eye tracking dysfunction and abnormal long latency event-related potentials are the most promising candidates. Both are independent of the effects of psychotropic medication or mental state at the time of testing, and twin studies demonstrate that each has a high level of heritability.

        "content": "These deficits are usually specific to the amblyopic eye. Subclinical deficits of the \"better\" eye have also been demonstrated. People with amblyopia also have problems of binocular vision such as limited stereoscopic depth perception and usually have difficulty seeing the three-dimensional images in hidden stereoscopic displays such as autostereograms. Perception of depth, from monocular cues such as size, perspective, and motion parallax remains normal. Cause Amblyopia has three main causes: Strabismic: by strabismus (misaligned eyes) Refractive: by anisometropia (difference of a certain degree of nearsightedness, farsightedness, or astigmatism), or by significant amount of equal refractive error in both eyes Deprivational: by deprivation of vision early in life by vision-obstructing disorders such as congenital cataract",

        "content": "PPI deficit in schizophrenia PPI deficits represent a well-described finding in schizophrenia, with the first report dating back to 1978. The abnormalities are also noted in unaffected relatives of the patients. In one study, patients failed to show increased PPI to attended prepulses. Dopamine, which plays a major role in schizophrenia, had been shown to regulate sensorimotor gating in rodent models. These findings fit to the dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia. In theory, PPI disruption in schizophrenia may be related to the processes of sensory flooding and cognitive fragmentation.",
