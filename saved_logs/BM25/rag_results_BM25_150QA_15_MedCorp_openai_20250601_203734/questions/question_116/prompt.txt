Document 1 (Title: Pinworm (parasite)): The pinworm (species Enterobius vermicularis), also known as threadworm (in the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand) or seatworm, is a parasitic worm. It is a nematode (roundworm) and a common intestinal parasite or helminth, especially in humans. The medical condition associated with pinworm infestation is known as pinworm infection (enterobiasis) (a type of helminthiasis) or less precisely as oxyuriasis in reference to the family Oxyuridae.
Document 2 (Title: [New anthelmintic drugs].): New anti-helminthic drugs have appeared lately: benzimidazoles (mebendazole, flubendazol, and abendazole), praziquantel and ivermectin. Mebendazol and flubendazol are poorly absorbed and are effective for ascaris, oxyuriasis and trycocephalus both in adults and children. Abendazole is well absorbed and may be considered the drug of choice for ascaris and oxyuriasis at a single 400 mg dose. This drug may also be used for hydatid cyst when surgery is not possible and for cysticercosis of the nervous system. Praziquantel is useful for treatment of tenia infections and ivermectin is useful for strongyloides and trichostrongyloides. Detailed dose schedules for different parasitic diseases are given in the text.
Document 3 (Title: Pinworm (parasite)): Almost the entire body of a gravid female becomes filled with eggs. The estimations of the number of eggs in a gravid female pinworm range from about 11,000 to 16,000. The egg-laying process begins about five weeks after initial ingestion of pinworm eggs by the human host. The gravid female pinworms migrate through the colon towards the rectum at a rate of 12 to 14 cm per hour. They emerge from the anus, and while moving on the skin near the anus, the female pinworms deposit eggs either through (1) contracting and expelling the eggs, (2) dying and then disintegrating, or (3) bodily rupture due to the host scratching the worm. After depositing the eggs, the female becomes opaque and dies. The female emerges from the anus to obtain the oxygen necessary for the maturation of the eggs. Infection E. vermicularis causes the medical condition enterobiasis, whose primary symptom is itching in the anal area.
Document 4 (Title: [A rare finding at gynaecological laparotomy: ovarian pregnancy and pinworm abscess (author's transl)].): A case of concommitant ovarian pregnancy and pinworm abscess is described. The histology and the incidence of Oxyuriasis in the female genital tract are discussed. The clinical symptoms and the management of the condition are also discussed.
Document 5 (Title: [Spontaneous stercoral fistula due to oxyurids: apropos of 1 case].): A spontaneous stercoral fistula containing pinworms was observed in a patient, 35 years after an appendicectomy. The various surgical complications of oxyuriasis are reviewed, in particular, the possibilities for the parasite to traverse the intestinal wall. In the case reported here, it appears that infiltration occurred in the external wall of the caecum.

Question: Select the incorrect statement(s) regarding oxyuriasis:
Options:
1. Löffler's syndrome manifests late in the course of oxyuriasis
2. The laying of eggs by female pinworms occurs 3 months after human infection
3. There may be moderate hypereosinophilia during oxyuriasis
4. The adult pinworm can be evacuated through the mouth
5. Flubendazole (FLUVERMAL®) is a medication used in oxyuriasis
