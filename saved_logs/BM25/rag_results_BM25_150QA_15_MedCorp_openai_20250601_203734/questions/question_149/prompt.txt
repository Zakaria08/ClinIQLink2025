Document 2 (Title: Babesiosis): Cause Babesia species are in the phylum Apicomplexa, which also has the protozoan parasites that cause malaria, toxoplasmosis, and cryptosporidiosis. Four clades of Babesia species infect humans. The main species in each clade are: B. microti (<3 µm) B. duncani B. divergens (cattle parasite seen mostly in Europe) and B. venatorum (roe deer parasite, formerly called EU1), most closely related to the large Babesia clade Large Babesia (>3 µm) mostly infects ungulates, but also includes K01 strain (an isolated case observed in South Korea, see isolated cases) Pathophysiology Babesia parasites reproduce in red blood cells, where they can be seen as cross-shaped inclusions (four merozoites asexually budding, but attached together forming a structure looking like a "Maltese cross") and cause hemolytic anemia, quite similar to malaria. Unlike the Plasmodium parasites that cause malaria, Babesia species lack an exoerythrocytic phase, so the liver is usually not affected.
Document 3 (Title: Microorganism): Disease Microorganisms are the causative agents (pathogens) in many infectious diseases. The organisms involved include pathogenic bacteria, causing diseases such as plague, tuberculosis and anthrax; protozoan parasites, causing diseases such as malaria, sleeping sickness, dysentery and toxoplasmosis; and also fungi causing diseases such as ringworm, candidiasis or histoplasmosis. However, other diseases such as influenza, yellow fever or AIDS are caused by pathogenic viruses, which are not usually classified as living organisms and are not, therefore, microorganisms by the strict definition. No clear examples of archaean pathogens are known, although a relationship has been proposed between the presence of some archaean methanogens and human periodontal disease. Numerous microbial pathogens are capable of sexual processes that appear to facilitate their survival in their infected host. Hygiene

Clinical Stage IV The declaration of AIDS HIV wasting syndrome * Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia Toxoplasmosis of the brain Cryptosporidiosis with diarrhoea > 1 month Cryptococcosis, extrapulmonary Cytomegalovirus disease of an organ other than liver, spleen or lymph node (ex: retinitis) Herpes simplex virus infection, mucocutaneous (>1 month) or visceral Progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy Any disseminated endemic mycosis Candidiasis of esophagus, trachea, bronchi Atypical mycobacteriosis, disseminated or lungs Non-typhoid Salmonella septicemia Extrapulmonary tuberculosis Lymphoma Kaposi's sarcoma HIV encephalopathy ** And/or performance scale 4: bedridden > 50% of the day during last month. (*) HIV wasting syndrome: weight loss of > 10% of body weight, plus either unexplained chronic diarrhoea (> 1 month) or chronic weakness and unexplained prolonged fever (> 1 month).
Document 5 (Title: Pyrimethamine): Pyrimethamine, sold under the brand name Daraprim among others, is a medication used with leucovorin (leucovorin is used to decrease side effects of pyrimethamine; it does not have intrinsic anti-parasitic activity) to treat the parasitic diseases toxoplasmosis and cystoisosporiasis. It is also used with dapsone as a second-line option to prevent Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia in people with HIV/AIDS. It was previously used for malaria but is no longer recommended due to resistance. Pyrimethamine is taken by mouth. Common side effects include gastrointestinal upset, severe allergic reactions, and bone marrow suppression. It should not be used by people with folate deficiency that has resulted in anemia. There is concern that it may increase the risk of cancer. While occasionally used in pregnancy it is unclear if pyrimethamine is safe for the baby. Pyrimethamine is classified as a folic acid antagonist. It works by inhibiting folic acid metabolism and therefore the making of DNA.
