This is usually observed in the face, hands, forearms, and lower legs. Healing is slow and leaves scarring. Though blisters are the most common skin manifestations of PCT, other skin manifestations include hyperpigmentation (similar to a tan) and hypertrichosis (mainly on the cheeks) also occur. PCT is a chronic condition, with external symptoms often subsiding and recurring as a result of multiple factors. In addition to the skin lesions, chronic liver disease is very common in patients with sporadic PCT. This involves hepatic fibrosis (scarring of the liver), and inflammation. However, liver problems are less common in patients with the inherited form of the disease. Additionally, patients will often void a wine-red color urine with an increased concentration of uroporphyrin I due to their enzymatic deficiency.",

        "content": "A 69-year-old white Italian woman was first seen at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in 1981 concerning several skin growths on her back. The patient had had several basal cell carcinomas surgically removed from her back during the preceding 5 years. There was no history of arsenic ingestion or prolonged sun exposure and her family history was negative for skin cancer. The patient had developed pulmonary tuberculosis in 1938 and was treated with pneumothorax therapy. She had had more than 50 fluoroscopic examinations of the chest following this therapy, as well as multiple diagnostic x-ray films since that time. She recalled that she had faced the fluoroscopy beam during the procedure. In 1959, she had a transabdominal hysterectomy for fibroid tumors. In 1980 she underwent a right modified radical mastectomy for adenoid cystic carcinoma of the breast; biopsies of lymph nodes were negative. Physical examination revealed a thin, white woman with a right mastectomy scar. On the back, clustered in the interscapular region, were multiple scars and nine erythematous nodules with pearly borders, telangiectasia, and translucent surfaces. Within several nodules there were areas of light and dark brown pigmentation. There were no other suspicious lesions on the head, chest, or extremities, nor did the patient show any evidence of the basal cell nevus syndrome. Biopsy of all lesions revealed basal cell carcinoma, some of which were pigmented, without evidence of chronic radiodermatitis. All lesions were treated with curettage and electrodesiccation three times with good cosmetic results (Fig. 1).",

Physical examination showed Gottron's papules on her fingers and a faint heliotrope rash. Biopsy of erythematous skin lesions on the shoulder and the back of the hand revealed perivascular inflammatory cell infiltration and tiny ulcerative lesions of the cutaneous tissue. Biopsy of the right quadriceps muscle showed type II fiber atrophy and slight perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate, whereas serum CPK level was within normal range. Chest X-ray film showed granular infiltrates in both lower lung fields. Based on the current findings the case was diagnosed as dermatomyositis associated with interstitial pneumonia. The administration of prednisolone, 30 mg/day resulted in the improvement of the skin lesions and muscle weakness, while the intensity of lung infiltrates was little affected. Three months after steroid therapy, the patient was readmitted because of increasing dyspnea on exertion and multiple skin ulcers. Chest X-ray revealed a small amount of gas in the mediastinum, in addition to slight deterioration of interstitial lung disease. In spite of various treatments for pneumomediastinum, including bed rest, administration of analgesics and oxygen inhalation, it developed rapidly, complicated severe subcutaneous emphysema and right-sided pneumothorax. Although high-dose prednisolone therapy and mediastinal drainage were performed, the pneumomediastinum was not resolved and she died from respiratory failure. At autopsy, predominant histological features of the lungs were acute interstitial pneumonia with hyaline membrane and edematous granulation formation in the alveoli.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Two years after this episode, he noticed a curious sensory experience. Namely, when he rubbed his hand or lateral trunk, similar sensation occurred on the foot of the same side simultaneously.

        "title": "[A case of hereditary angioneurotic edema associated with systemic lupus erythematosus].",
        "content": "A 33-year-old woman noticed recurrent and sudden attacks of subcutaneous swelling of the extremities and face since the age of 4 years. Sometimes the attacks involved colicky abdominal pain. Her mother and younger sister had episodes of recurrent swelling of the extremities as well. Complement studies revealed low CH50, C1q, C4, and C1 inhibitor levels, with normal C3 and C5 levels. Similar reductions of CH50 C4 and C1 inhibitor levels were observed in her mother, older, and younger sisters. Therefore, she was diagnosed as hereditary angioneurotic edema. In addition, she was diagnosed as having a butterfly rash at the age of 20 years and had a history of solar sensitivity. Histologically the facial lesion showed liquefaction degeneration of the basal cell layer. Direct immunofluorescent staining of the affected skin lesion showed basement membrane-zone staining of IgG and IgM. Laboratory studies revealed lymphopenia and positive ANF. On the basis of the above findings, hereditary angioneurotic edema associated with systemic lupus erythematosus was diagnosed.",

        "content": "PLE appears on areas of the skin newly exposed to sunlight such as the visible part of the neckline, backs of hands, arms and legs, and feet, but less commonly the face. At these areas, there may be feelings of burning and severe itching. Smooth red-topped small papules which merge into plaques, small fluid-filled blisters (papulovesicles) and less commonly target-shaped lesions which look like erythema multiforme may be visible. In addition, it may occur in other parts of the body in some people treated for inflammatory skin diseases with phototherapy. The rash is usually quite symmetrical and characteristic for each individual, appearing similar with each recurrence, but can look dissimilar in different people. Fever, fatigue and headaches have been previously associated with the eruption, but are rare. The rash may persist for many days to a couple of weeks, resolving spontaneously without scarring as long as further sunlight exposure is avoided.",
