The results provide the following information: (1) CNS structures other than the basal forebrain are sensitive to NGF during early development. (2) Both normal and hypothyroid rats are more sensitive to NGF deprivation than NGF supplementation. (3) The effects of anti-NGF antibodies in normal rats are similar to those induced by anti-NGFr antibodies. (4) NGF alone had little or no effect, but interacts with T4 in promoting cell maturation, especially in hypothyroid rats. (5) Hypothyroid rats are more sensitive to T4 and to T4 plus NGF than are normal ones. (6) The synergistic action of both trophic factors, but not that of T4, tend to disappear at long term in hypothyroid rats. (7) The differential sensitivity of the brain areas to T4, NGF, or both trophic factors correlates with their cell acquisition rate, especially in hypothyroid rats. (8) T4 and NGF together act more markedly (but not exclusively) on the cholinergic structures in both normal and hypothyroid rats. (9) RNA appears to be very sensitive to NGF, especially in hypothyroid rats. In close correlation with preliminary morphological observations, the results clearly demonstrate that an interaction between T4 and NGF regulates the ontogeny of a number of neuronal structures in CNS independently of their neurotransmitter phenotype, but with a regional specificity. The possibilities of accounting for this interaction, in particular the major role of thyroxine, are discussed.",

Eight to 10 mumol/liter EMD 21388 added to pooled rat serum completely displaced [125I]T4 or [125I]T3 binding from TTR, the major thyroid hormone-binding protein in the rat, and markedly increased the percentages of free T4 and T3, measured by equilibrium dialysis.

Infusion of 2.0 and 4.0 micrograms IL-1/day caused a significant decrease in plasma free T4 levels during the first 2-4 days, whereas plasma total T4 levels and T4 binding were significantly lowered throughout the week of the study. The infusion of 0.5 micrograms IL-1/day did not significantly change plasma TSH or total and free T4 levels. During the infusion of 2.0 micrograms IL-1/day, the decrease in plasma free T4 levels was paralleled by a significant decline in plasma TSH values and an impaired TSH responsiveness to TRH administration on the second day of infusion. IL-1 (2.0 micrograms/day) treatment significantly lowered plasma levels of T4-binding prealbumin, whereas it did not influence the plasma T3/T4 ratio or hepatic 5'-deiodinase activity. Plasma rT3 levels remained undetectable in both control and IL-1-treated rats. Chronic infusion of rats with 4.0 micrograms IL-1/day induced prolonged fever, whereas at the lower doses of IL-1, temperatures were elevated only on the first 2 days. IL-1 at doses of 2.0 and 4.0 micrograms/day induced a transient decrease in food intake and a suppression of body weight gain. Restriction of food consumption to the level observed in the 2.0 micrograms IL-1 experiment caused small decreases in T3, total and free T4, and TSH levels compared to those in ad libitum fed rats, but had no effects on T4 binding. We conclude that 1) continuous infusion of rats with 2.0 and 4.0 micrograms IL-1/day induces changes in thyroid economy commonly seen during infectious diseases and other systemic illnesses in rats [decreased plasma levels of TSH, T3, and (free) T4; diminished T4 binding; and decreased plasma T4-binding prealbumin levels], 2) the decrease in food intake during IL-1 treatment cannot completely explain the observed changes in thyroid hormone and TSH levels; and 3) it is highly unlikely that the decrease in thyroid hormone binding during chronic IL-1 infusion is caused by decreased food intake. Further studies are needed to clarify whether the observed alterations in thyroid economy during IL-1 infusion reflect direct effects of IL-1 per se or indirect effects caused by the mild illness induced by the cytokine.",
        "contents": "Continuous infusion of interleukin-1 beta induces a nonthyroidal illness syndrome in the rat. We studied the effects of continuous administration of recombinant human interleukin-1 beta (IL-1) on pituitary-thyroid function. Rats were equipped with minipumps loaded with either IL-1 (delivery rate, 0.5, 2.0, or 4.0 micrograms/day, ip, for 1 week) or saline. Infusion of 2.0 and 4.0 micrograms IL-1/day caused a significant decrease in plasma free T4 levels during the first 2-4 days, whereas plasma total T4 levels and T4 binding were significantly lowered throughout the week of the study.

        "content": "Replacement by thyroid extract in hypothyroidism was one of the most effective treatments of any disease available to physicians before the middle of the 20th century, and in severe cases afforded dramatic relief of the myriad symptoms. The decision to treat was usually based on the presence of signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism because there were no accurate, readily available laboratory tests of thyroid function. Many less severe cases of hypothyroidism went untreated. Dosage was regulated by improvement of symptoms. Desiccated Thyroid became a commercial treatment option in 1934 with Westhroid,. In the early 1960s, desiccated thyroid hormones (thyroid extract) began to be replaced by levothyroxine (synthetic T4), or by combinations of T4 and T3. Replacement occurred faster in the United Kingdom than in North America, but by the 1980s more patients were being prescribed synthetic T4 (levothyroxine) or synthetic T4/T3 combinations than desiccated thyroid extract.",

        "content": "Dexamethasone, 2 mg every 6 hours for 4 doses, was given to 4 hypothyroid patients receiving treatment with synthetic thyroxine (T4) and to 8 untreated hyperthyroid patients with Graves' disease, and serum concentrations of thyroid hormones were measured by radioimmunoassays. Serum concentration of 3,3'5'-triiodothyronine (reverse T3, rT3) increased appreciably within 8 hours after the first dose of dexamethasone, was maximum at 24-32 hours after beginning dexamethasone, and remained elevated for about 24 hours after discontinuing the steroid. The mean baseline serum rT3 was 58 ng/per 100 ml in treated hypothyroid patients and 119 ng per 100 ml in patients with Graves' disease; the corresponding maximal post-dexamethasone serum rT3 values were 87 and 170 serum concentration of 3,3',5-triiodothyronine (T3) decreased. The decrease in serum T3 was significant at about 24 hours after beginning dexamethasone and was maximal at about 30 hours in both groups of cases under study. The decrease in serum T3 persisted in treated hypothyroid cases for about 24-48 hours and in Graves' disease cases as long as studied, at least 5 days after discontinuing hexamethasone. The changes in serum rT3 and T3 could not be attributed to the effect of dexamethasone on serum protein binding of the iodothyronines because the dialyzable fractions of rT3 and T3 following steroid administration were not different from those before it. Serum T4 did not change appreciably in treated hypothyroid cases, but decreased in Graves' disease cases from a mean baseline value of 23.5 mug per 100 ml to 18.4 mug per 100 ml 3 days after beginning dexamethasone. In addition, 3 hyperthyroid cases were studied before, during, and after administration of dexamethasone, 2 mg every 6 h for 5 days. Serum rT3 increased again as noted above and the increase persisted until about 24 hours after the last dose of the steroid. Serum T3 decreased considerably and remained decreased as long as studied, at least 4 days after discontinuing the steroid. Serum T4 decreased appreciably in 2 of the 3 cases studied. The data suggest that 1) conversion of T4 to T3 and to rT3 may occur via two distinct pathways in the metabolism of T4; 2) the changes in serum rT3 and T3 observed in our study may be due in part at least to a steroid-induced 'shift' in the metabolism of T4 whereby conversion of T4 to T3 is diminished and that to rT3 is enhanced; 3) in addition to the effect on peripheral metabolism of T4, steroids appear to reduce the circulating thyroid hormones in Graves' disease by another mechanism, probably by reduction in thyroid secretion.",
