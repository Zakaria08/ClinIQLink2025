        "content": "A case of miliary tuberculosis associated with acute respiratory failure during pregnancy was reported. A 39-year-old, 29-week pregnant woman was admitted to our hospital with complaints of nonproductive cough and fever on June 12. On admission, her temperature was 38.2 degrees C; pulse rate was 90/min., and blood pressure was 120/76 mmHg. Physical examination revealed moist rales at right lung basis. Chest X-ray showed small nodular infiltrates in right lower lung field. Laboratory data revealed positive CRP, accelerated ESR and increased level of alpha 2-globulin. The number of T-cells was markedly decreased (14/mm3). The PPD skin test was negative, and the sputum smears for acid-fast bacilli were negative. Suspected of bacterial or viral pneumonia, the patient was treated with antibiotics (CPM, EM and CAZ), which had no effects for her. On June 16, the Chest X-ray showed infiltrates throughout bilateral lung fields, and the patient became increasingly dyspneic. On June 18, the results of arterial blood gas, analysis under room air were: PaO2 26.7 Torr, PaCO2 29.0 Torr, pH 7.505. Because of severe hypoxemia, she was intubated and placed on a volume-cycled respirator. Hydrocortisone (1000 mg, daily) was added to treatment because ARDS was suspected. Since the smears of tracheobronchial secretions showed acid-fast bacilli on June 24, she was diagnosed to have miliary tuberculosis. Then the intensive therapy with antituberculosis drugs (isoniazid 400 mg, rifampicin 450 mg, and streptomycin 1g, daily) was started. The non specific antibiotics were discontinued; hydrocortisone was tapered and stopped. The next week, she became afebrile and hypoxemia steadily improved.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "content": "Wilson's disease associated with hepatic failure is not common and the underlying mechanism triggering the event is not known at present. We treated a 28-year-old Japanese woman with Wilson's disease who developed hepatic failure associated with hemolytic crisis just after delivery. She was diagnosed as having Wilson's disease at 12 years of age, at which time she started taking D-penicillamine. She had previously delivered two children without difficulty. When she found out she was pregnant this time, she stopped taking D-penicillamine in contrast to taking it faithfully during her first two pregnancies. On the day of delivery of her full-term baby, jaundice developed accompanied with severe hemolytic crisis. Plasma exchanges and blood transfusion were performed and D-penicillamine administration was started again. She gradually recovered and apparently was following a good clinical course. However, on day 30 the second hemolytic crisis occurred and subsequent liver failure led her to death on day 50. At autopsy her liver was cirrhotic and showed massive necrosis. Prophylactic oral administration of D-penicillamine and careful observation are therefore recommended to prevent hemolytic crisis during the perinatal period.",

She had had two previous pregnancies: the first one had been voluntarily interrupted; the second one went to term, but the child, born in a state of apparent death, died on the third day. Despite severe normocytic anaemia (5 mmol.l-1 haemoglobin, 2.9 T.l-1 erythrocytes, 0.25 haematocrit, 93 fl mean globular volume), she was symptomless. The diagnosis was confirmed by haemoglobin electrophoresis: 0 haemoglobin A (HbA) and 0.854 haemoglobin S (HbS). Because foetal growth and maturation appeared satisfactory, no procedure to increase the HbA/HbS ratio was used before the 37th week of amenorrhea. At that time, erythrocytapheresis was carried out using a discontinuous flow cell separator. Eight phenotyped red cell packs without leukocytes (removed by filtration) were transfused; at the end of the procedure, there was 0.67 HbA and 0.25 HbS. At 39 week amenorrhea, haemoglobin electrophoresis gave 0.43 HbA and 0.47 HbS. No further treatment was therefore given. At the 40th week, she gave birth to a healthy girl, Apgar score 10 at 1 min. She was given two further red cell packs at start of labour, because her haemoglobin level had fallen to 6.4 mmol.l-1. In the immediate postpartum, her HbS level was 0.38.

The last time it happened, she was in a pharmacy and had her blood pressure taken. She was told it was 165/110 mm Hg.

        "content": "A 37 year-old female with Kallmann syndrome and NIDDM who had two successful deliveries is reported. She had experienced no menstruation until she had treatment with gestagen in her early twenties. She had withdrawal bleeding only once. At the age of 25, she consulted her family doctor, complaining of amenorrhea. Estrogen progesterone cyclic therapy caused withdrawal bleeding, and clomiphene citrate failed to induce apparent ovulation. In January 1978, 150 IU of hMG was administered daily for 9 days, and then 3000 IU of hCG daily for the following 2 days. This therapy induced pregnancy, which failed spontaneously on June 4th. A year later, in January 1979, 150 IU of hMG was again administered daily for 7 days followed by 6000 IU of hCG for 3 days. This therapy again induced pregnancy. On September 27th, 1979, she delivered a girl vaginally, weighing 3830 g. After this delivery, she experienced no menstruation. In June 1985, she consulted her family doctor again, and she was diagnosed as being pregnant. Since her fasting blood glucose was 145 mg/dl, she was admitted to Kosei Hospital to control her blood glucose. On October 15th, she delivered a girl weighing 2600 g. On June 13th, 1989, she was referred to Kosei Hospital by her family doctor to achieve an accurate control of her blood glucose. During this admission, she was diagnosed as having Kallmann syndrome because of congenital anosmia and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism without any abnormal morphological changes. Vitamin B1 infusion test was negative.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
