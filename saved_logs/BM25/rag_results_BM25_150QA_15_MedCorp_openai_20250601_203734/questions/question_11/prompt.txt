Document 1 (Title: [Three cases of spontaneous bilateral external carotid-cavernous sinus fistula (dural arteriovenous shunts in the region of the cavernous sinus) (author's transl)].): Since Fincher reported a case with arteriovenous fistula between the external carotid artery and dural sinus, many type of cases have been reported. On the other hand, so called the external carotid avernous fistula has been recognized less 20 cases in literature. We have observed three additional cases of dural arteriovenous shunts in the region of the cavernous sinus. Case 1. A 52 year old woman had suffered from left side sever headache. There was weakness of the left extraocular muscles and left ptosis. A bruit was heard over the left orbit. She was treated for hypertension since 38 year old. And she has no history of recent trauma. Selective internal and external carotid angiographies showed the bilateral external carotid cavernous sinus fistula. No operative treatment was performed in this case and the symptomes disappeared with decrease of blood pressure. Case 2. A 50 year old man came to this clinic with chief complaints of right ptosis, diplopia and headache. He was treated for diabetes mellitus and ...
Document 2 (Title: [An attempt of electrothrombosis of carotid-cavernous fistula (author's transl)].): The patient was 50 year-old female who was admitted to our department on June 13, 1973 complaining of left conjunctival injection and ipsilateral exophthalmos. Visual acuity of her right eye had been lost almost completely due to the previous ocular injury. Ophthalmological examination revealed left conjunctival injection, slight ipsilateral proptosis but pulsation of eye ball, chemosis and bruit were not so obvious. She had a visual acuity of 1.2 on her left eye. Left intraocular pressure was 30 mmHg while right was normal. Left CAG revealed a left carotid-cavernous fistula with anterior, posterior, inferior venous drainage. Temporal craniotomy was done and copper needles were inserted into the posterior part of Parkinson's triangle. An angiogram after operation demonstrated the persistency of the anterior and posterior venous drainage. 6 weeks later, electrothrombosis of left superior ophthalmic vein was carried out. After that, carotid-cavernous fistula disappeared perfectly. Important points of the surgic...
Document 3 (Title: Carotid-cavernous fistula): A carotid-cavernous fistula results from an abnormal communication between the arterial and venous systems within the cavernous sinus in the skull. It is a type of arteriovenous fistula. As arterial blood under high pressure enters the cavernous sinus, the normal venous return to the cavernous sinus is impeded and this causes engorgement of the draining veins, manifesting most dramatically as a sudden engorgement and redness of the eye of the same side. Presentation CCF symptoms include bruit (a humming sound within the skull due to high blood flow through the arteriovenous fistula), progressive visual loss, and pulsatile proptosis or progressive bulging of the eye due to dilatation of the veins draining the eye. Pain is the symptom that patients often find the most difficult to tolerate. Patients usually present with sudden or insidious onset of redness in one eye, associated with progressive proptosis or bulging.They may have a history of similar episodes in the past.
Document 4 (Title: [Abulia: a case of cerebral infarction in the bilateral genua of internal capsules].): A patient was presented with an outstanding symptom of abulia due to cerebral infarcts in the bilateral genua of internal capsules. A 53-year-old woman, generally in good health and active, had no contributory medical history except for hypertension. She was well until August 20, 1988, when she was noted to have become taciturn and absent-minded. In the morning, she got up and went to work as usual. Although she worked without trouble, she hardly talked with her colleagues. After getting home from work, she would lie down without doing any housework, and this was continued on the following day. However, she had no physical problems. She was thus admitted to a hospital on August 22. Lethargy and urinary incontinence were apparent for a few days. Thereafter she became awakeful and could take care of herself. She sat on her bed all the time, and could talk normally with her daughter. She was referred subsequently to the Department of Neurology, Hyogo Prefectural Tsukaguchi Hospital on August 30. On examination, ...
Document 5 (Title: [Tolosa-Hunt syndrome. Report of a surgical case].): A 58-year-old male presented with painful right ophthalmoplegia and was diagnosed as having Tolosa-Hunt syndrome. High-dose oral administration of a corticosteroid provided significant pain relief, but total ophthalmoplegia persisted. Computed tomography (CT) showed a tumor-like mass in the bilateral cavernous sinus. Angiography revealed occlusion of the right internal carotid artery. According to the literature, about 70% of cases of Tolosa-Hunt syndrome are caused by parasellar neoplasms. A transcranial biopsy of the patient's lesion revealed a nonspecific granulomatous process in the wall of the right cavernous sinus. He was again placed on high-dose corticosteroid therapy and within 1 week the right visual acuity improved slightly. The corticosteroid dose was gradually tapered over 3 months. After 2 months of therapy, the external ocular movement had almost fully recovered, although the light reflex was absent and the CT findings did not change.

Question: A 46-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 2-week history of diplopia and ocular pain when reading the newspaper. She also has a 3-month history of amenorrhea, hot flashes, and increased sweating. She reports that she has been overweight all her adult life and is happy to have lost 6.8-kg (15-lb) of weight in the past 2 months. Her pulse is 110/min, and blood pressure is 148/98 mm Hg. Physical examination shows moist palms and a nontender thyroid gland that is enlarged to two times its normal size. Ophthalmologic examination shows prominence of the globes of the eyes, bilateral lid retraction, conjunctival injection, and an inability to converge the eyes. There is no pain on movement of the extraocular muscles. Visual acuity is 20/20 bilaterally. Neurologic examination shows a fine resting tremor of the hands. Deep tendon reflexes are 3+ with a shortened relaxation phase. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's ocular complaints?
Options:
A. Granulomatous inflammation of the cavernous sinus
B. Abnormal communication between the cavernous sinus and the internal carotid artery
C. Glycosaminoglycan accumulation in the orbit
D. Sympathetic hyperactivity of levator palpebrae superioris
