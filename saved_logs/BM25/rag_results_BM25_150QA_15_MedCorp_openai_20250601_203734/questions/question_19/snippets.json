These infections include but are not limited to: bronchitis, ear infections, meningitis, pneumonia, sinus infections, and skin infections. Such infections can potentially damage organs, leading to severe complications. Other symptoms of hypogammaglobulinemia include chronic diarrhea and complications from receiving live vaccines. Certain symptoms of chronic damage may be related to recurrent infection. For example, shortness of breath, chronic cough, and sputum production may indicate the presence of bronchiectasis. Sinus pain, nasal discharge, and postnasal drip may indicate the presence of chronic sinusitis. Diarrhea and steatorrhea may indicate malabsorption. Another sign or symptom that may occur in patients is blotchiness of the skin color, especially noticed above the waist, on the arms, neck, and upper chest areas, however, it may occur anywhere",

        "content": "Acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity has been recognized since 1966. Patients experiencing a massive hepatic insult due to acetaminophen (APAP) may recover with minimal residual complications or develop fulminant hepatic necrosis. We report 3 patients with hepatic failure due to an APAP overdose who received orthotopic liver transplants and survived. An 18-y-o female ingested 60 500 mg APAP tablets (30 g). She presented with tachycardia and lethargy stating that she had taken amoxipine, carbamazepine, and lorazepam. She began to recover but on day 2 experienced an upper gastrointestinal bleed and became hypotensive and hyperpyrexic. She developed hepatic encephalopathy and it was then determined she had ingested APAP. Her APAP level was 13 micrograms/ml 96 h post-ingestion. She was successfully transplanted 19 d post-ingestion with recovery. A 40-y-o female was admitted for flu-like symptoms persisting for 7 d. She was jaundiced, hyperventilating and hypotensive. She admitted ingesting approximately 17 g APAP over 36 h. Her APAP level was 12.2 micrograms/ml. Her condition worsened and on day 3 she was in grade IV coma. She was successfully transplanted 4 d post-arrival with recovery. A 16-y-o female ingested an unknown amount of APAP. She presented approximately 24 h post-ingestion with a serum APAP level of 130 micrograms/ml. Her condition deteriorated and she became encephalopathic with grade IV coma. She was successfully transplanted on day 7 post-arrival. Hepatotoxicity can occur as a result of either acute or chronic APAP overdose. Although n-acetylcysteine (NAC) is effective antidotal therapy, it must be used within 8-12 h post-ingestion to be optimally effective. Inaccurate patient histories may prevent NAC administration resulting in hepatotoxicity. Liver transplantation is a viable option to be considered in those APAP overdose patients who experience rapidly progressing encephalopathy, hemolysis, and hepato-renal failure.",
