Following the first report of transanal evisceration by Brodie in 1827, more than 70 cases have been reported to date, the majority occurring spontaneously in elderly individuals. Straining, chronic constipation, and rectal ulcerations predispose to spontaneous perforation in elderly individuals. Cases of transanal evisceration of children whilst sitting over uncovered swimming pool drains have been reported; notable cases include Valerie Lakey (1993) and Abigail Taylor (2007). In Taylor's case, the suction dislodged and damaged her liver and pancreas; several meters of her small intestine were forcefully pulled through her anus. In both these cases, the victims were left with short bowel syndrome and required feeding by total parenteral nutrition. After multiple operations, Taylor later died from transplant-related cancer.",

        "content": "In each of eight thoracolumbar human cadaveric vertebrae, a hole was made through one pedicle into the vertebral body with a drill bit and through the contralateral pedicle with a probe. Identical metal screws were implanted into the holes to equal depths, and maximum pull-out force was determined for each screw. Using a paired Student t test, no significant difference (P = 0.87) was found in pull-out strength between the screws implanted into drilled holes and those implanted into probed holes. In fact, the average pull-out strengths for the two groups differed by less than 2%. The pedicular cortex was broken through during hole preparation in 5 of the 16 pedicles: 3 as a result of drilling and 2 secondary to probing. The average pull-out strength of the screws in these five pedicles was 11.0% less than the average pull-out strength of the screws implanted into the contralateral intact pedicles. Although this does not represent a statistically significant difference (P = 0.15), it suggests that damaging the pedicular cortex may weaken pedicle screw fixation.",

        "content": "Despite progress in the treatment of imperforate anus, anal stenosis, rectal prolapse, and other late complications may still arise. In 1987, we described the three-flap anoplasty for the treatment of rectal prolapse following pull-through operations. Since 1986, we have performed 14 three-flap anoplasties in combination with an anterior perineal rectal pull-through for primary treatment of imperforate anus. The mean age at definitive repair was 4.4 months (range, 0 to 14 months). Eleven of the 14 primary pull-through procedures could be performed through a perineal approach only. There were no deaths. At a mean follow-up of 24.2 months, none of the patients has developed prolapse, and only one has had a temporary stenosis. Three children are already fully continent, and soiling is absent in 12. All have a good sphincter tone. Although it is too early to evaluate long-term results, it appears that the three-flap anoplasty prevents mucosal prolapse through the interposition of a skin-lined anal canal. Moreover, a combination of this technique with the anterior perineal approach provides an excellent exposure with minimal dissection of the perineal and pelvic musculature and allows for easy and safe pull-through of the rectal pouch, making an abdominal counterincision unnecessary in most cases. It reproduces at the same time a normal anatomy while taking advantage of all existing structures.",

Two adolescent and three adult patients with Hirschsprung's disease treated between 1973 and 1987 at the University of Michigan Medical Center are reported.

Diagnosis in each case was made with barium enema and full-thickness rectal biopsy. Four patients underwent endorectal pull-through procedures, all with good long-term results. The fifth patient, initially treated with a Duhamel retrorectal pull-through procedure, required reoperation for constipation secondary to a retained rectal septum. Review of 199 cases of adult Hirschsprung's disease enables comparison of the various operative procedures for this disorder with respect to postoperative complications and functional outcomes.

        "content": "Because disadvantages are inherent in the conventional station pull-through technique (SPT) currently used for recording lower esophageal sphincter pressure (LESP), a more suitable recording method is needed. In study, we evaluated a rapid pull-through technique (RPT) for recording LESP and compared the results with those obtained by SPT. The RPT features rapid withdrawal of recording sensors across the LES during a 10- to 20-sec interval of suspended respiration. This method avoids recording \"artifact\" caused by respiratory LES motion and provides precise end points for scoring and measurement. In 12 normal subjects, LESP measured by RPT (24.3 plus or minus 0.5 mm Hg) was comparable, but significantly greater, than LESP measured by SPT (21.1 plus or minus 9.1 mm Hg). Analysis of LESP scores for the two recording methods revealed that both intraobserver and interobserver error were substantially less for RPT than SPT (P less than or equal to 0.01). Further correlation of LESP between studies was greater for the RPT than the SPT recording method. We conclude that RPT represents a convenient method for recording LESP which is easier to perform and yields more reproducible values than LESP recording by SPT.",

        "content": "It is unusual for Hirschsprung's disease to go undiagnosed until late childhood. Adolescents presenting with Hirschsprung's disease offer unique challenges to the surgeon because of the massively dilated and hypertrophied colon that is invariably present. Five adolescents (four males and one female; ages, 11 1/2 to 16 1/4 years) with newly diagnosed Hirschsprung's disease were managed by slightly different methods between January 1981 and March 1987. Three patients had a \"leveling\" colostomy, followed by a Swenson procedure in two and a Duhamel procedure with a temporary diverting colostomy in one. One patient had a primary Duhamel procedure with a temporary diverting ileostomy. One patient had a primary Swenson procedure without diversion. Long-term results were uniformly excellent. Based on the experience with these patients the following principles of management emerge: 1) Avoid loop \"leveling\" colostomies because of their grotesque size and their tendency to retract or prolapse. 2) Rectal tube decompression can often adequately prepare a patient for a primary pull-through procedure. 3) When a diverting ostomy is required, it should be an ileostomy rather than a colostomy because its subsequent closure will not endanger the marginal artery, which if divided, could compromise the blood supply to the pulled-through colon. 4) The Swenson procedure, although difficult in adolescents, can be done with excellent long-term results. 5) Several applications of the stapling instrument are required in the Duhamel procedure to fully divide the septum between the aganglionic rectum anteriorly and the normal colon posteriorly.",
