        "content": "A forward evacuation hospital functioned in the southern front in October 1973 Israeli-Arab War as an intermediate unit in the Israeli casualty management logistics. Casualties were characterized by frequent multiple-system injuries and variable combinations of penetrating wounds, blunt trauma, burns, and inhalation injury, with an increased incidence of associated blunt trauma. As the result of the systems organization, the EH was able to provide the wounded with early intensive and definitive resuscitation therapy which permitted further evacuation of the casualties to the central hospitals in a better state of physiological stability. In the most critically wounded when there was imminent threat to survival, operations were performed at the EH as an integral part of the resuscitation process. Performance of operations in a forward evacuation hospital did not increase the number or severity of postoperative complications. Morbidity and mortality were related to the nature and magnitude of injury.",

        "content": "External disasters occur at locations separate from the hospital, such as transportation incidents or industrial accidents. Disasters can be both internal and external disasters concomitantly, such as natural disasters that cause mass casualties as well as damage hospital structure. Disasters can be acute or ongoing. Acute disasters have a general time of onset of the time of an event occurring. Acute disasters have a typical patient flow, which produces numerous low acuity patients presenting to the hospital, overwhelming the surge capacity, or the number of patients the facility can care for presenting at a single time. This surge event is followed by the majority of patients presenting by personal transport and later EMS or prehospital transport of the critically ill. Peak volumes in acute disasters are expected at two to three hours post-event. Evolving disasters such as infectious pandemics have a gradual progression to critical populations, but volumes and resource strain remain for extended periods. Disaster types can further subdivide into categories such as natural disasters, chemical disasters, and bioterrorism; each subdivision produces a specific injury or exposure profile and individual strain on resources that can guide emergency preparedness planning and response.",

        "content": "During the Persian Gulf war, the entire Israeli population was under the threat of chemical missiles. One of the main effects of chemical agents (e.g., organophosphorus) is respiratory distress, which requires treatment with mechanical ventilation and oxygen enrichment. In the event of a chemical missile attack, the civilian hospitals may enter a state of insufficiency for treating such victims due to the limited amount of equipment, staff and oxygen/air sources. A possible technological solution is a multiple respirator system (MRS) with a multiple oxygen enrichment system designed for use in the battlefield. The advantages of these technologies in the civilian hospital setting during a chemical mass casualty situation are: (a) rapid deployment, (b) high transportability, (c) capability of operation in any location, (d) modularity, and (e) less medical staff for operation. Two types of MRS are described and issues concerning their selection are discussed. The authorities responsible for national health policy may wish to adopt and incorporate these technologies into their hospital and emergency services preparedness system.",

Review of medical records of patients hospitalized as a result of missile attacks. During the Persian Gulf War in the winter of 1991, Israel received 18 missile attacks involving 39 surface-to-surface Scud missiles. The uncertainty in time, place, and type of warhead, conventional or chemical, was a source of chronic stress and the immediate cause for many traumatic stress reactions at or near the missile attack sites. Data from victims who were injured after each missile attack were available through a central hookup between 12 local hospitals and the Medical Corps of the Israeli Defence Force. The number of persons diagnosed in the hospital as psychological casualties after each missile attack. Approximately 43% of the 773 casualties evacuated to hospitals were diagnosed as psychological casualties, and an additional 27% had mistakenly injected themselves with atropine. Data also indicated that triage of psychological casualties to hospitals was more a function of the rescue team's training and preparation than the severity or extent of injury or damage. Optimal treatment during events that cause mass casualties requires proper preparation of rescue teams as well as reorganization of the hospital's psychiatric services.

        "content": "During mass casualty events the consequences of psychological trauma are an important cause of morbidity among survivors and rescue personnel. Data available from military and civilian disasters over the past 70 years has shown a fairly predictable ratio of acute and severe emotional trauma associated with mass casualty events. Long-term morbidity from psychological trauma can rival or exceed that of the physical injuries of survivors. Psychological intervention reduces this morbidity, and early psychological intervention is more effective before adverse psychological symptoms have fully developed. However, the widely accepted value of early psychological intervention is not universal, with controversy over the degree of emotional trauma expected after a large-scale catastrophic mass casualty event, as well as the number of victims and the effectiveness of immediate psychological intervention. Some research even suggests that there is only a minor risk of acute emotional trauma among survivors of a major disaster. The United States faces the possibility of mass casualties from national disasters--particularly earthquakes--and conventional warfare. It has been predicted that 100,000 major injuries requiring hospitalization and 20,000 deaths would result from the maximum plausible natural disaster incident in the United States. Pentagon planners expect thousands of servicemen to be evacuated to the United States for hospitalization on a daily basis during an overseas conventional war. With these estimates of potential casualties, it is imperative that this controversy be resolved as quickly as possible.
