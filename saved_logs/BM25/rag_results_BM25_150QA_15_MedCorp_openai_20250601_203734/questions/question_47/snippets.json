        "content": "A 25-year old man with 5-year history of bronchiectasis was admitted to the ICU complaining of severe shortness of breath. He had a respiratory rate of 40 to 50 breath/min. On 0.5 l/min of oxygen with nasal cannula, arterial blood pH was 7.39, Paco2 52.3 mmHg, Pao2 45.0 mmHg. Then, on 1 l/min of oxygen, Pao2 was unchanged, but Paco2 increased to 58 mmHg. As his consciousness was so clear, we applied to him the negative extra-thoracic pressure ventilator which was designed by the authors. Negative extra-thoracic pressure ventilation (NETPV) was maintained at a IMV rate of 30 breath/min, peak negative extra-thoracic pressure of -20 to -30 cmH2O, and an inspiratory/expiratory ratio of 1:2. During NETPV, his respiratory rate and oxygen consumption were decreased and Pao2 was increased compared with his spontaneous breathing. He made a recovery from dyspnea, especially, he was able to take a deep breath. When NETPV was applied to him, pulmonary artery and arterial catheterizations revealed that central venous pressure was slightly decreased, cardiac index unchanged or slightly decreased, heart rate, systemic blood pressure, and pulmonary arterial pressure unchanged compared with spontaneous breathing. The patient was able to read books and maintained communication in his voice with his family and the medical staff. After 3 days of the treatment with NETPV, a marked improvement was noted and the patient was discharged from the ICU. NETPV has the benefits as follows. First, it is very easy for both a patient and a doctor to assist his breathing because an endotracheal intubation is not necessary.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

This hypothesis could not yet be tested because of the lack of methods measuring continuously important parameters of respiration without altering the patient's vigilance.

The following study was performed to investigate the effects of the Benzodiazepine Antagonist Flumazenil (Anexate) on parameters of vigilance and respiration after Midazolam/Fentanyl anesthesia. 40 healthy patients aged 18-65 years who were to undergo arthroscopy were randomly assigned to Flumazenil (Group F) or no Flumazenil = Control (Group C). All patients received 7.5-10 mg Midazolam, 0.3-0.6 Fentanyl, 4-6 mg Vecuronium, were intubated and ventilated with 8 ml/kg BW VT x 12/min - N2O/O2 = 2:1.

The following parameters were registered: Transcutaneous Oxygen Saturation (SAT) and Heart Rate (HR) continuously, Sedation (every minute) and Reactions to acoustic or verbal stimuli in the case of hypoxemia.

Pulse Oximetry offers this possibility. The following study was performed to investigate the effects of the Benzodiazepine Antagonist Flumazenil (Anexate) on parameters of vigilance and respiration after Midazolam/Fentanyl anesthesia. 40 healthy patients aged 18-65 years who were to undergo arthroscopy were randomly assigned to Flumazenil (Group F) or no Flumazenil = Control (Group C). All patients received 7.5-10 mg Midazolam, 0.3-0.6 Fentanyl, 4-6 mg Vecuronium, were intubated and ventilated with 8 ml/kg BW VT x 12/min - N2O/O2 = 2:1. At the end of operation Group F received 0.3-0.5 mg Flumazenil. When adequate spontaneous ventilation was restored the patients were extubated and brought to a single bed room where they were monitored and observed without being disturbed, except at the arrival time (T1), 15 min (T2) and 30 min (T3) when blood pressure was measured and the pain score was asked. The following parameters were registered: Transcutaneous Oxygen Saturation (SAT) and Heart Rate (HR) continuously, Sedation (every minute) and Reactions to acoustic or verbal stimuli in the case of hypoxemia. The two groups were compared with respect to the number and severity of hypoxic events/15 min, the mean degree of sedation (6 point scale) and the number of adequate reactions to the acoustic alarm resp. instruction: \"Take a deep breath!\" Wilcoxon Test, Chi-Square test (p less than or equal to 0.05) is significant). The groups were comparable with respect to their anthropometric data, dosages of Midazolam and Fentanyl, and perioperative blood pressures. Parameters of vigilance: Group F was less sedated than Group C (p = 0.052) and reacted better to the verbal instruction to take a deep breath in the case of hypoxia (p less than or equal to 0.05). Parameters of respiration: Hypoxic states occurred more frequently in group F (p = 0.098) and lasted longer. The severeness was significantly more pronounced in group F (p less than or equal to 0.05). There were no complications and the patients acceptance of the anesthetic procedure was high. The hypothesis that postoperative respiratory depression is related to the degree of vigilance cannot be accepted. In contrast there is a strong evidence that under special conditions patients can be in a relatively high degree of vigilance and do not breathe with subsequent severe hypoxemia. The possible u",
