Document 1 (Title: Enzyme): The rate of a reaction is dependent on the activation energy needed to form the transition state which then decays into products. Enzymes increase reaction rates by lowering the energy of the transition state. First, binding forms a low energy enzyme-substrate complex (ES). Second, the enzyme stabilises the transition state such that it requires less energy to achieve compared to the uncatalyzed reaction (ES‡). Finally the enzyme-product complex (EP) dissociates to release the products. Enzymes can couple two or more reactions, so that a thermodynamically favorable reaction can be used to "drive" a thermodynamically unfavourable one so that the combined energy of the products is lower than the substrates. For example, the hydrolysis of ATP is often used to drive other chemical reactions. Kinetics
Document 2 (Title: Activation energy): site release energy. A chemical reaction is able to manufacture a high-energy transition state molecule more readily when there is a stabilizing fit within the active site of a catalyst. The binding energy of a reaction is this energy released when favorable interactions between substrate and catalyst occur. The binding energy released assists in achieving the unstable transition state. Reactions otherwise without catalysts need a higher input of energy to achieve the transition state. Non-catalyzed reactions do not have free energy available from active site stabilizing interactions, such as catalytic enzyme reactions.
Document 3 (Title: Enzyme): Enzymes can accelerate reactions in several ways, all of which lower the activation energy (ΔG‡, Gibbs free energy) By stabilizing the transition state: Creating an environment with a charge distribution complementary to that of the transition state to lower its energy By providing an alternative reaction pathway: Temporarily reacting with the substrate, forming a covalent intermediate to provide a lower energy transition state By destabilising the substrate ground state: Distorting bound substrate(s) into their transition state form to reduce the energy required to reach the transition state By orienting the substrates into a productive arrangement to reduce the reaction entropy change (the contribution of this mechanism to catalysis is relatively small)
Document 4 (Title: Enzyme catalysis): In 1971-1972 the first quantum-mechanical model of enzyme catalysis was formulated. Active enzyme The binding energy of the enzyme-substrate complex cannot be considered as an external energy which is necessary for the substrate activation. The enzyme of high energy content may firstly transfer some specific energetic group X1 from catalytic site of the enzyme to the final place of the first bound reactant, then another group X2 from the second bound reactant (or from the second group of the single reactant) must be transferred to active site to finish substrate conversion to product and enzyme regeneration. We can present the whole enzymatic reaction as a two coupling reactions:
Document 5 (Title: Active site): Each active site is evolved to be optimised to bind a particular substrate and catalyse a particular reaction, resulting in high specificity. This specificity is determined by the arrangement of amino acids within the active site and the structure of the substrates. Sometimes enzymes also need to bind with some cofactors to fulfil their function. The active site is usually a groove or pocket of the enzyme which can be located in a deep tunnel within the enzyme, or between the interfaces of multimeric enzymes. An active site can catalyse a reaction repeatedly as residues are not altered at the end of the reaction (they may change during the reaction, but are regenerated by the end). This process is achieved by lowering the activation energy of the reaction, so more substrates have enough energy to undergo reaction. Binding site
