        "content": "To explore some determinants of physicians' decisions to change practice habits, we posed three questions: To what extent are some particular innovations diffused among office-based primary care physicians? What characterizes the physicians who have adopted these innovations? And, what caused them to change their behavior and adopt the innovations? Three \"markers,\" recent innovation in medical practice, were chosen using an expert consensus technique. A telephone survey of 200 office-based pediatricians was conducted, and the physicians were asked whether or not they used the following three innovations in medical practice: continuous rather than intermittent phenobarbital for the prevention of febrile seizures, glycosylated hemoglobin measurement in the management of diabetes, and slow release theophylline in the management of asthma. The questionnaire was completed by 156 pediatricians. Of the 110 pediatricians who cared for diabetics, 73% used glycosylated hemoglobin measurement; of the 145 who saw patients with febrile seizures, 77% prescribed the continuous use of phenobarbital (if they used it at all); and, of the 152 pediatricians who cared for asthmatics, 86% reported using slow-release theophylline. The characteristics significantly associated with using the innovations were board certification, group rather than solo practice, teaching, medically related publications, academic appointment, younger age, and caring for a greater number of patients per week. For two of the innovations, discussion with a colleague was the most important source of information leading to a change of practice. The subjects cited local specialists as the colleagues who most often sparked the adoption of an innovation.",

        "content": "Dentists can be divided into five adoption categories based upon their time of adoption of pit and fissure sealants: innovators, early adopters, early majority, late majority, and laggards. The differences among dentists in the five adoption categories were examined for four classes of variables: practice characteristics, dentist characteristics, communication of information, and practice environment. Questionnaires were mailed in September 1984 to a random sample (N = 521) of Washington State dentists in general practices. A total of 376 completed questionnaires were returned, for a response rate of 72 percent. Adoption of sealants proceeded as follows: 5 percent of dentists through 1973, 24 percent through 1979, 50 percent through 1982, and 75 percent through 1984. Adoption category was related to percent of assistants who were certified, delegation to assistants and hygienists, magnitude of the fees charged by the practice, number of staff meetings per month, the dentist having been an officer in a dental organization, year the dentist adopted other new technologies, dentist's self-rating of willingness to try new things, percent of patients who are children, and percent of the dentist's colleagues who used sealants. These data lend some support to the two-stage or opinion-leader model of diffusion and suggest that new technologies can be promoted by first influencing dentists who consistently adopt early.",

        "content": "Current theories of organizational performance are used to guide researchers at the Health Services Research Center of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the University of Illinois Survey Research Laboratory in the evaluation of the National Cancer Institute's Community Clinical Oncology Program (CCOP) and to derive policy options to enhance program operations. CCOP represents an innovative mechanism designed to improve the accrual of patients to phase III clinical trials, involve community-based oncologists in clinical research, and potentially to disseminate new information on the state-of-the-art cancer treatment to areas distant from cancer centers and research-oriented medical centers. Examined in this evaluation of the second phase of the CCOP are the ability of the 52 currently funded CCOPs and 17 research bases to accrue patients to cancer treatment and cancer control research protocols, their influence on the patterns of practice for cancer treatment in CCOP communities, and their influence on cancer control awareness and activity among primary care physicians. The evaluation applies selected organizational perspectives to describe the intraorganizational and interorganizational characteristics of the CCOPs, research bases, and the Institute that may affect the performance of the CCOP. This organizational approach relates the accrual and influence of the CCOP to controllable aspects of the program's design and management strategies that can be changed through policies directed by the National Cancer Institute. These policies include the criteria used to select CCOPs, the role of research bases in the development and implementation of treatment and cancer control research protocols, and the use of accrual credits.",

        "content": "Various external special interest groups are promoting attempts to better measure and control the performance of the medical profession, primarily to restrain costs. We can neither afford to ignore the rising costs nor reject efforts by provincial licensing authorities to improve supervision of the quality of care. Furthermore, there is increasing public interest in the outcome of medical treatment and a suspicion that some care may be unnecessary or inappropriate. Much of what physicians do is not based on impeccable or complete scientific evidence, and we have not established a method whereby science can consistently be translated into practice. Optimal practice patterns must be defined to improve the quality of care and to maximize the efficiency with which scarce resources are used. Careful scientific evaluation of data is particularly necessary with the arrival of new drugs and technology. Sensible, flexible guidelines produced by appropriate panels will help promote improved practice. Rigid standards must be avoided to allow for individual consideration and scientific innovation. The recognized difficulties of influencing clinical practice by precept or education and the problems imposed by rapidly changing scientific knowledge are two hurdles to be overcome. Licensing bodies must identify and enforce minimal standards, but optimal practice patterns are better devised by a broader segment of the profession. Intervention by third-party payers, as is prevalent in the United States, intrudes upon physician autonomy and reduces access to care. Physicians must support the development of guidelines for optimal medical practice based on the best existing data and focused on improving the quality of care.",
