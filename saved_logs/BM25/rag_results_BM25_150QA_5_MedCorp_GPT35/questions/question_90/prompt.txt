Document 1 (Title: Sirtex): Results from the largest most comprehensive study to date evaluating SIRT in liver metastases from colorectal cancer were presented at ASCO in 2012, ASCO-GI 2013 and ASCO in 2014. The various subsets of the MORE study, led by Andrew S. Kennedy M.D. Physician in Chief, Radiation Oncology Sarah Cannon Research Institute Nashville Tenn., have demonstrated safety and efficacy as well as the same in treating the elderly. The most recent set of data presented at ASCO in 2014 documented the ability to predict success of SIRT using standard laboratory tests prior to treatment. In addition, the global SIRFLOX study which completed patient recruitment in 2013 will evaluate SIR-Spheres microspheres a first-line treatment for colorectal liver metastases.
Document 2 (Title: Liver Metastasis -- Epidemiology): Nearly 20% to 25% of patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer will develop liver metastases, with 15% to 25% of these cases presenting with synchronous disease. [4] [5] The most common metastases originated from colorectal primaries, followed by pancreatic and breast. In females less than 50 years of age, metastatic hepatic disease originated more frequently from the breast. Metastatic liver disease in those older than 70 years old was from a gastrointestinal source; 92% of metastatic hepatic lesions were carcinomas. Of these carcinoma lesions, 75% of them were adenocarcinomas. [3] Overall, histologically confirmed hepatic metastases were more common in males than females, and most patients were older than 50 years of age.
Document 3 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): Systemic che-motherapy is recommended in almost all cases of distant spread. However, unlike many other malignancies, highly selected patients with isolated, resectable metastases may benefit from resection (metastasectomy). The most common site of metasta-sis is the liver. Of patients with systemic disease, approximately 15% will have metastases limited to the liver. Of these, 20% are potentially resectable for cure. Survival is improved in these patients (20–40% 5-year survival) when compared to patients who do not undergo resection. Hepatic resection of synchronous metastases from colorectal carcinoma may be performed as a combined procedure or in two stages. The second most com-mon site of metastasis is the lung, occurring in approximately 20% of patients with colorectal carcinoma. Although very few of these patients will be potentially resectable, among those who are (about 1–2% of all colorectal cancer patients), long-term survival benefit is approximately 30% to 40%. There are

Document 5 (Title: [Prognosis in synchronous liver metastasis from colorectal cancer. A multicenter study of patients with cancer of the rectum and cancer of the rectosigmoid colon].): A prospective investigation of 188 patients with cancer of the rectum and rectosigmoid colon with synchronous liver metastases is described. The mean survival time for 183 patients who did not receive any treatment for the liver metastases was six months and only one survived for longer than 37 months. After extirpation of the primary tumour, the most significant prognostic factors were etrahepatic metastases, enlarged liver on account of metastases and more than three liver metastases. Serum basic phosphatases had the greatest significance among a series of laboratory tests. In the sub-groups with the best possible prognoses, the mean survival time was 12 months. 25% five-year survival has been described in the literature following resection of the liver in patients with a maximum of three metastases, no other metastases and age under 70 years. Provided this holds true, liver surgery will be a therapeutic possibility in at least 100 patients per annum in Denmark with synchronous liver metastases and 25 of these will be cured. This figure requires an improved programme for the diagnosis of synchronous liver metastases than at present and the same high frequency of extirpation of the primary colorectal cancer on a national basis which was achieved in the present material.
