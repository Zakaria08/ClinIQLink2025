Document 1 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Epicardial coronary arteries are the major site of atherosclerotic disease. The major risk factors for atherosclerosis (high levels of plasma low-density lipoprotein [LDL], low plasma high-density lipoprotein [HDL], cigarette smoking, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus [Chap. 291e]) disturb the normal functions of the vascular endothelium. These functions include local control of vascular tone, maintenance of an antithrombotic surface, and control of inflammatory cell adhesion and diapedesis. The loss of these defenses leads to inappropriate constriction, luminal thrombus formation, and abnormal interactions between blood cells, especially monocytes and platelets, and the activated vascular endothelium. Functional changes in the vascular milieu ultimately result in the subintimal collections of fat, smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, and intercellular matrix that define the atherosclerotic plaque. Rather than viewing atherosclerosis strictly as a vascular problem, it is useful to
Document 2 (Title: Beta-blockers, plasma lipids, and coronary heart disease.): High plasma cholesterol concentration is an important coronary heart disease risk factor, particularly in subjects less than 50 years old. Cholesterol is transported mainly by low (LDLs) and high (HDLs) density lipoproteins. High plasma levels of HDL and its apolipoprotein (A-I) are associated with low coronary heart disease risk, and the reverse is true for LDL and its apolipoprotein (B). Plasma levels of very low density lipoproteins (VLDLs) are probably not an independent risk factor, and the situation for plasma triglycerides is unclear. beta-Blockers have no significant effects on plasma concentrations of either total or LDL cholesterol, but HDL plasma concentration is reduced by about 10%, particularly by nonselective beta-blockers. Plasma triglyceride and VLDL concentrations are both raised by beta-blockade. Despite these plasma lipid changes, beta-blockers, by decreasing myocardial oxygen requirements, exhibit marked anti-ischemic properties. beta-Blockers without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity effect a 30% decrease in death from myocardial infarction (MI) in the years after an acute MI. Primary prevention of MI by beta-blockade in hypertensive persons has been well debated and probably exists (although to a lesser extent than secondary prevention) in men, particularly for nonsmokers (for nonselective beta-blockers), and despite any plasma lipid changes. beta-Blockade can inhibit the preatheromatous and atheromatous changes induced by catecholamines in the coronary arteries of animals. beta-blockers may also reduce or slow the following processes: 1) endothelial permeability to lipoproteins; 2) acylcholesterol acyltransferase activity within the arterial wall, thereby preventing cholesterol esterification and deposition in foam cells; 3) LDL precipitation with arterial wall proteoglycans; 4) calcium influx into atheromatous areas; 5) preatheromatous increased endothelial turnover; 6) heart rate; 7) blood velocity and flow disturbances; 8) atheromatous plaque rupture and consequent coronary thrombosis; and 9) platelet activity. Thus, beta-blockers may inhibit atheromatous plaque formation and reduce the likelihood of plaque beta-blockers may inhibit atheromatous plaque formation and reduce the likelihood of plaque rupture, clot formation, and coronary thrombosis.
Document 3 (Title: High-density lipoprotein): Recommended ranges The American Heart Association, NIH and NCEP provide a set of guidelines for fasting HDL levels and risk for heart disease. High LDL with low HDL level is an additional risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Measuring HDL concentration and sizes As technology has reduced costs and clinical trials have continued to demonstrate the importance of HDL, methods for directly measuring HDL concentrations and size (which indicates function) at lower costs have become more widely available and increasingly regarded as important for assessing individual risk for progressive arterial disease and treatment methods. Electrophoresis measurements Since the HDL particles have a net negative charge and vary by density & size, ultracentrifugation combined with electrophoresis have been utilized since before 1950 to enumerate the concentration of HDL particles and sort them by size with a specific volume of blood plasma. Larger HDL particles are carrying more cholesterol.
Document 4 (Title: Biochemistry, Lipids -- Clinical Significance): Levels of plasma lipids are good indicators of the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). For instance, hyperlipoproteinemia is related to a greater risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, as well as a higher occurrence of ischemic vascular disease and development of fatty deposits under the skin, known as xanthomas and xanthelasmas. Elevated plasma concentrations of total cholesterol and LDL are linked with an increased risk of coronary heart disease and raised plasma triglycerides.  An increase in VLDL is related to a greater prevalence of atherosclerotic heart disease. However, elevated levels of HDL cholesterol may protect against atherosclerotic heart disease, due to its ability to prevent excessive accumulation of cholesterol in the body. There are several types and subtypes of lipid-related disorders and they are described below. Hypertriglyceridemia is a disorder with high levels of triglycerides in the blood. Five main disorders result in hypertriglyceridemia:
Document 5 (Title: APOA5): Apolipoprotein A-V is a protein that in humans is encoded by the APOA5 gene on chromosome 11. It is significantly expressed in liver. The protein encoded by this gene is an apolipoprotein and an important determinant of plasma triglyceride levels, a major risk factor for coronary artery disease. It is a component of several lipoprotein fractions including VLDL, HDL, chylomicrons. It is believed that apoA-V affects lipoprotein metabolism by interacting with LDL-R gene family receptors. Considering its association with lipoprotein levels, APOA5 is implicated in metabolic syndrome. The APOA5 gene also contains one of 27 SNPs associated with increased risk of coronary artery disease.
