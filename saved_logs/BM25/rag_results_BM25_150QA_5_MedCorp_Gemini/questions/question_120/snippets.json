As for the writer complex in Figure 4\u201340, sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins (transcription regulators) direct where such modifications occur (discussed in Chapter 7). Some idea of the complexity of the above processes can be derived from the results of genetic screens for genes that either enhance or suppress the spreading and stability of heterochromatin, as manifest in effects on position effect variegation in Drosophila (see Figure 4\u201332). As pointed out previously, more than 100 such genes are known, and most of them are likely to code for subunits in one or more reader\u2013writer\u2013remodeling protein complexes.",

        "title": "Citric acid",
        "content": "Acid salts of citric acid can be prepared by careful adjustment of the pH before crystallizing the compound. See, for example, sodium citrate. The citrate ion forms complexes with metallic cations. The stability constants for the formation of these complexes are quite large because of the chelate effect. Consequently, it forms complexes even with alkali metal cations. However, when a chelate complex is formed using all three carboxylate groups, the chelate rings have 7 and 8 members, which are generally less stable thermodynamically than smaller chelate rings. In consequence, the hydroxyl group can be deprotonated, forming part of a more stable 5-membered ring, as in ammonium ferric citrate, \u00b72. Citric acid can be esterified at one or more of its three carboxylic acid groups to form any of a variety of mono-, di-, tri-, and mixed esters. Biochemistry Citric acid cycle",

        "title": "Purification, size, and properties of the complex of orotate phosphoribosyltransferase: orotidylate decarboxylase from mouse Ehrlich ascites carcinoma.",
        "content": "Complex U, which contains the last two enzymes (orotate phosphoribosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.10) and orotidylate decarboxylase (EC 4.1.23)) of the six enzymes for the de novo biosynthesis of UMP, has been purified 200-fold from mouse Ehrlich ascites cells. The specific activity of the orotate phosphoribosyltransferase and the orotidylate decarboxylase activities of the complex were 0.115 and 0.290 mumol of product/mg of protein/min; the recovery of the activities was high being 20 to 30%. The rate of the two activities remained similar to that of the homogenate. At the sixth step of the fractionation, one can obtain a fraction that has lost phosphoribosyltransferase activity but retains decarboxylase activity. The apparent molecular weights, as determined by density gradient centrifugation, of the native complex and the fraction containing only decarboxylase activity are identical, 55,700 +/- 4,000. Both activities of complex U are labile to very mild treatments such as dilution, dialysis, or storage at 3 degrees. Dithiothreitol and 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PP-Rib-P), but not orotic acid or MgCl2, can stabilize either or both of the enzyme activities. The degree of stabilization by three of these chemicals varies with the reagent(s) used, with the nature of the treatment, and with the concentration of Complex U. When PP-Rib-P, Mg2+ and dithiothreitol are present in the diluting buffer the activity losses were slowed and then followed by a partial recovery of the phosphoribosyltransferase activity. Maximum activities of both enzymes are observed by adding undiluted complex to a complete reaction mixture without preincubation. The complex cannot be exposed to pH values of 4 or below, or pH 9 or above. The stability studies have led to the development of conditions that permit one, for the first time, to subject the complex to electrophoresis and to recover a large percentage of both enzyme activities, rather than only decarboxylase activity as has occurred in the past. The electrophoretic studies indicate that PP-Rib-P produces a complex whose conformation and/or net charge differ significantly from that of the complex in the absence of PP-Rib-P. Kinetic characteristics of the transferase are a pH optimum between 6.5 and 7.5, apparent Km values for orotate, PP-Rib-P, and Mg2+ of 1.9 muM, 16 muM, and 2.9 mM, respectively; for the decarboxylase, a sharp pH optimum of 7.0 is observed, and a Km value for orotidine 5'-phosphate of 0.8 muM.",

Benjamin (2002) defines complexes of metals with more than one type of ligand, other than water, as mixed-ligand-complexes. In some cases, a ligand contains more than one donor atom, forming very strong complexes, also called chelates (the ligand is the chelator). One of the most common chelators is EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid), which can replace six molecules of water and form strong bonds with metals that have a plus two charge. With stronger complexation, lower activity of the free metal ion is observed. One consequence of the lower reactivity of complexed metals compared to the same concentration of free metal is that the chelation tends to stabilize metals in the aqueous solution instead of in solids.",
