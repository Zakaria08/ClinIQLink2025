Immediate aggressive surgical debridement of all necrotic tissue was performed. Intravenous antibiotics and resuscitation fluid and hyperbaric oxygenation were also administered to all patients. Skin grafting was performed for 4 patients (40%), 3 weeks after surgical debridement. One patient died (12.5%) and 2 subsequently developed an urethral stricture. Etiology, treatment and outcome of Fournier's gangrene are discussed and the results of the study are compared to other studies. This disease is still serious, its pathogenesis is not completely elucidated, but when immediate adequate treatment is performed, the outcome is generally favourable.",

The pathologic findings are described as synergistic gangrene secondary to a polymicrobial flora with a poorly defined portal of entry. We report 3 cases of Fournier's gangrene. Case 1 was a 67 years old who was admitted with the chief complaint of scrotal swelling and necrosis. Case 2 was a 59 years old who was admitted with the problem of scrotal swelling and pain, he had sought other medical help without success, and was then transferred to our hospital. Case 3 was a 62 years old who was admitted with the chief complaint of scrotal swelling and pain for 2 days. These 3 patients were all found to have diabetes mellitus. All 3 patients required aggressive surgical debridement, broad-spectrum antibiotics and adjunctive measures. Blood cultures were usually negative and pus cultures were typically aerobic gram-negative rods and gram-positive cocci and anaerobic bacteria of various types, especially Bacteroids fragilis. Our pus cultures revealed Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus in Case 1, Enterobacter cloacae in Case 2 and E. coli, B. fragilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in Case 3. This disease is no longer a disease of young men. After 1945, the average age in 119 reported cases was 51.3 years and the average age of our cases was 62.7 years. Before the era of antibiotics, scrotal gangrene was not a rarity. In these modern times, in spite of seeking medical attention early, patients still developed scrotal gangrene and the mortality rate is high.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
