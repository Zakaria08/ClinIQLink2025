Document 1 (Title: Pyloric stenosis): Cause Rarely, infantile pyloric stenosis can occur as an autosomal dominant condition. It is uncertain whether it is a congenital anatomic narrowing or a functional hypertrophy of the pyloric sphincter muscle. Pathophysiology The gastric outlet obstruction due to the hypertrophic pylorus impairs emptying of gastric contents into the duodenum. As a consequence, all ingested food and gastric secretions can only exit via vomiting, which can be of a projectile nature. While the exact cause of the hypertrophy remains unknown, one study suggested that neonatal hyperacidity may be involved in the pathogenesis. This physiological explanation for the development of clinical pyloric stenosis at around 4 weeks and its spontaneous long term cure without surgery if treated conservatively, has recently been further reviewed.
Document 2 (Title: Pyloric stenosis): Most cases of pyloric stenosis are diagnosed/confirmed with ultrasound, if available, showing the thickened pylorus and non-passage of gastric contents into the proximal duodenum. Muscle wall thickness 3 millimeters (mm) or greater and pyloric channel length of 15 mm or greater are considered abnormal in infants younger than 30 days. Gastric contents should not be seen passing through the pylorus because if it does, pyloric stenosis should be excluded and other differential diagnoses such as pylorospasm should be considered. The positions of superior mesenteric artery and superior mesenteric vein should be noted because altered positions of these two vessels would be suggestive of intestinal malrotation instead of pyloric stenosis.
Document 3 (Title: First_Aid_Step1): Abdominal structures enter the thorax A ; may occur due to congenital defect of pleuroperitoneal membrane or from trauma. Commonly occurs on left side due to relative protection of right hemidiaphragm by liver. Most commonly a hiatal hernia, in which stomach herniates upward through the esophageal hiatus of the diaphragm. Sliding hiatal hernia—gastroesophageal junction is displaced upward as gastric cardia slides into hiatus; “hourglass stomach.” Most gastric fundus common type. Associated with GERD. Paraesophageal hiatal hernia— gastroesophageal junction is usually normal but gastric fundus protrudes into the thorax. Goes through the internal (deep) inguinal ring, external (superficial) inguinal ring, and into the groin. Enters internal inguinal ring lateral to inferior epigastric vessels. Caused by failure of processus vaginalis to close (can form hydrocele). May be noticed in infants or discovered in adulthood. Much more common in males B .

Document 5 (Title: Cesarean section does not improve outcome in gastroschisis.): Elective cesarean section (CS) following prenatal diagnosis of gastroschisis has been advocated to decrease morbidity and mortality. To examine this hypothesis, we reviewed the records of 28 consecutive patients with gastroschisis treated between 1975 and 1987. Fourteen infants were delivered vaginally (V) and fourteen by CS, of which seven were elective, five were for fetal distress, and two were for breech presentation. Prenatal diagnosis was made in nine infants in the CS group and none in the vaginal group. The two groups were comparable in gestational age (V = 37.6 weeks, CS = 35.8 weeks, P = .05), birth weight (V = 2,508 g, CS = 2,444 g, P = NS), and five-minute Apgar score (V = 7.8, CS = 6.8, P = NS). Outcome was similar as measured by hospital mortality (V = 0/14, CS = 1/14, P = NS), complications (V = 4/14, CS = 5/14, P = NS), days to enteral feeding (V = 14, CS = 19, P = NS), and days in the hospital (V = 27, CS = 34, P = NS). The only complication related to mode of delivery was preventable; an inf...

Question: A 3900-g (8.6-lb) male infant is delivered at 39 weeks' gestation via spontaneous vaginal delivery. Pregnancy and delivery were uncomplicated but a prenatal ultrasound at 20 weeks showed a defect in the pleuroperitoneal membrane. Further evaluation of this patient is most likely to show which of the following findings?
Options:
A. Gastric fundus in the thorax
B. Pancreatic ring around the duodenum
C. Hypertrophy of the gastric pylorus
D. Large bowel in the inguinal canal
