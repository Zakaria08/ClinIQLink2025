        "content": "Cause Rarely, infantile pyloric stenosis can occur as an autosomal dominant condition. It is uncertain whether it is a congenital anatomic narrowing or a functional hypertrophy of the pyloric sphincter muscle. Pathophysiology The gastric outlet obstruction due to the hypertrophic pylorus impairs emptying of gastric contents into the duodenum. As a consequence, all ingested food and gastric secretions can only exit via vomiting, which can be of a projectile nature. While the exact cause of the hypertrophy remains unknown, one study suggested that neonatal hyperacidity may be involved in the pathogenesis. This physiological explanation for the development of clinical pyloric stenosis at around 4 weeks and its spontaneous long term cure without surgery if treated conservatively, has recently been further reviewed.",

To examine this hypothesis, we reviewed the records of 28 consecutive patients with gastroschisis treated between 1975 and 1987. Fourteen infants were delivered vaginally (V) and fourteen by CS, of which seven were elective, five were for fetal distress, and two were for breech presentation. Prenatal diagnosis was made in nine infants in the CS group and none in the vaginal group. The two groups were comparable in gestational age (V = 37.6 weeks, CS = 35.8 weeks, P = .05), birth weight (V = 2,508 g, CS = 2,444 g, P = NS), and five-minute Apgar score (V = 7.8, CS = 6.8, P = NS).

The only complication related to mode of delivery was preventable; an infant delivered vaginally had avulsion of a short segment of mesentery requiring bowel resection. Infants born by CS were slightly more likely to have primary closure (5/14) than babies delivered vaginally (3/14, P = NS), but this may reflect independent trends in the last 5 years. Elective CS following prenatal diagnosis in seven patients did not improve outcome; primary closure was achieved in only one infant, and three had a complication. Since these data show no significant difference in morbidity and mortality between vaginal and CS delivery, we suggest that CS should not be recommended simply because a prenatal diagnosis of gastroschisis is made.",

The authors retrospectively reviewed prenatal findings in 14 cases of conjoined twins. Thoracoomphalopagus was the most common type of conjoining, occurring in five cases (36%). Prenatal sonography showed shared hearts in nine (64%) cases, indicating severe conjoining and negligible chance for postnatal correction. Two sets of omphalopagus conjoined twins had separate hearts; however, severe congenital heart disease was present. Early prenatal diagnosis and assessment of the degree of conjoining provided couples with the option for pregnancy termination via vaginal delivery. In this series, nine patients elected pregnancy termination prior to 24 weeks and delivered vaginally. Transvaginal ultrasound significantly improved the delineation of conjunction in two patients, and computed tomography permitted the diagnosis to be confirmed in two patients.",
        "contents": "Conjoined twins: prenatal diagnosis and assessment of associated malformations. Prenatal diagnosis of conjoined twins is difficult and was rarely accomplished prior to the advent of sonography. Early prenatal diagnosis and assessment for shared vital organs are desirable for optimal obstetrical counseling and management. The authors retrospectively reviewed prenatal findings in 14 cases of conjoined twins. Thoracoomphalopagus was the most common type of conjoining, occurring in five cases (36%). Prenatal sonography showed shared hearts in nine (64%) cases, indicating severe conjoining and negligible chance for postnatal correction. Two sets of omphalopagus conjoined twins had separate hearts; however, severe congenital heart disease was present. Early prenatal diagnosis and assessment of the degree of conjoining provided couples with the option for pregnancy termination via vaginal delivery. In this series, nine patients elected pregnancy termination prior to 24 weeks and delivered vaginally. Transvaginal ultrasound significantly improved the delineation of conjunction in two patients, and computed tomography permitted the diagnosis to be confirmed in two patients.",
