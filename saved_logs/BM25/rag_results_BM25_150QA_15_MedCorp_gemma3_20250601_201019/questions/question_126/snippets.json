        "title": "Cefpodoxime proxetil. A review of its antibacterial activity, pharmacokinetic properties and therapeutic potential.",
        "content": "Cefpodoxime proxetil is an orally administered prodrug which is absorbed and de-esterified by the intestinal mucosa to release the third generation cephalosporin, cefpodoxime. Cefpodoxime is stable towards the most commonly found plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases and the drug has a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity encompassing both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, rendering it a possible option for empirical use in a wide range of community acquired infections in both adult and paediatric patients. The extended plasma half-life of cefpodoxime (1.9 to 3.7 h) permits twice daily administration. In comparative trials, twice daily cefpodoxime proxetil (dose equivalent cefpodoxime 100 to 400 mg) was as effective as a 3- to 4-times daily regimen of phenoxymethylpenicillin in pharyngotonsillitis, as well as thrice daily amoxicillin (with or without clavulanic acid) or cefaclor against infections of the ear, the upper and lower respiratory tract, the urinary tract and those of the skin and soft tissues. The latter reflects the enhanced antistaphylococcal activity of cefpodoxime, which distinguishes it from other orally active third generation cephalosporins such as cefixime. Most notably, an oral regimen of cefpodoxime proxetil was as efficacious as parenterally administered ceftriaxone for the treatment of bronchopneumonia in hospitalised patients at risk due to the presence of underlying diseases, addictions or advancing age. A single oral dose of cefpodoxime was also as efficacious as ceftriaxone in uncomplicated anogenital gonococcal infections. Cefpodoxime proxetil is generally well tolerated, with mild to moderate gastrointestinal disturbances occurring in 4 to 15% of patients treated with therapeutic doses. Thus, a convenient twice daily oral regimen of cefpodoxime proxetil can be prescribed as an effective alternative to established beta-lactam therapies in the empirical outpatient treatment of infections of the respiratory and urinary tracts as well as those of the skin and soft tissues.",

Thirty-nine of the children had been unsuccessfully treated with vanous oral antibiotics prior to admission [corrected].

        "content": "To discuss the chemistry, mechanism of action, spectrum of activity, pharmacokinetics, clinical trials, adverse-effect profile, drug interactions, and dosage guidelines of azithromycin, the first azalide antibiotic. Pertinent literature published between 1988 and the present was identified via a MEDLINE search. Of 77 articles retrieved, 37 have been referenced. Azithromycin is a new agent, and as such, limited data regarding this drug are available in the literature. We evaluated all pharmacokinetic, microbiologic, and basic science articles pertaining to azithromycin, and reviewed the clinical efficacy trials that we believed were of good quality for each indication for which azithromycin has received approval to date. Comparative clinical trials involving large numbers of patients, clinical outcome assessments, and recommendations for azithromycin use are included. Azithromycin is a macrolide derivative and the first of the 15-membered ring azalide class of antimicrobials. Although its mechanism of action and susceptibility to resistance are similar to those of the macrolide antibiotics, azithromycin's extended spectrum of activity includes gram-positive and gram-negative organisms, as well as atypical pathogens. Azithromycin is stable at gastric pH and has an absolute bioavailability of approximately 37 percent following oral administration. Although its serum concentrations are typically low, the drug concentrates to a high degree in tissue. Azithromycin is cleared primarily by the biliary and fecal routes; its serum half-life is in excess of 60 hours. Several clinical trials have proven that a 5-day course of azithromycin administered once a day is equally efficacious to a 7- to 14-day course of other commonly used oral antimicrobials, administered two to four times a day, for the treatment of upper and lower respiratory tract and skin and skin-structure infections. Urethritis and cervicitis caused by chlamydia are treated with a single 1-g dose. Trials have shown azithromycin's adverse-effect profile to be equal or even superior to that of other agents, with only 0.7 percent of patients discontinuing therapy versus 2.6 percent for comparable drugs. Azithromycin represents a significant improvement in the treatment of selected community-acquired infections. Although this agent may revolutionize the treatment of sexually transmitted diseases caused by chlamydia, it also should impact the management of respiratory tract and skin and skin-structure infections. Because of its unique pharmacokinetics and excellent adverse-effect profile, patient compliance should be greatly enhanced compared with other commonly used oral antimicrobials. Azithromycin's primary role in the near future will be in the community setting. Although its use in the hospital may be limited, this drug will be a convenient therapeutic option to have on hand in the emergency room and outpatient clinic. Azithromycin may also be used in the future to treat opportunistic infections in immunocompromised patients.",

        "content": "Aztreonam, the first commercially available monobactam, has a wide range of activity against aerobic gram-negative bacilli. It can be administered two to three hours daily because its half-life is 1.6 to 2 hours. Excellent blood and tissue concentrations are attained. The MIC of aztreonam against most Enterobacteriaceae is less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml and against P aeruginosa less than or equal to 16 micrograms g/ml. Aztreonam has been used in a wide array of infections of the urinary tract and respiratory tract, blood, intra-abdominal and gynecologic infections and infections of the skin, bones and joints. As empiric therapy, aztreonam is usually combined with another antimicrobial agent active against anaerobes and/or aerobic gram-positive cocci until culture results are available. One exception is empiric therapy for gram-negative urinary tract infections in which aztreonam can be used initially as monotherapy against susceptible gram-negative pathogens. In general, the efficacy of aztreonam is equal or superior to that of the aminoglycosides. Adverse reactions to aztreonam are unusual, and it as been shown to be a poor hapten, permitting its administration to patients with proven allergy to the penicillins and cephalosporins. Aztreonam is a useful addition to the available antibiotics for treatment of gram-negative infections.",

Empiric antibiotic therapy should be guided by the most likely source of infection and the patient's past exposure to healthcare facilities. In particular, a recent history of exposure to a healthcare setting may necessitate the need for antibiotics with pseudomonas aeruginosa coverage or broader coverage for resistant organisms. Extended generation cephalosporins such as ceftriaxone or beta lactam/beta lactamase inhibitor antibiotics such as piperacillin-tazobactam are frequently used for the treatment of gram negative bacteremia.",
