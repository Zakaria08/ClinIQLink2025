        "content": "Mechanism of action Methotrexate is an antimetabolite of the antifolate type. It is thought to affect cancer and rheumatoid arthritis by two different pathways. For cancer, methotrexate competitively inhibits dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), an enzyme that participates in the tetrahydrofolate synthesis. The affinity of methotrexate for DHFR is about 1000-fold that of folate. DHFR catalyses the conversion of dihydrofolate to the active tetrahydrofolate. Folic acid is needed for the de novo synthesis of the nucleoside thymidine, required for DNA synthesis. Also, folate is essential for purine and pyrimidine base biosynthesis, so synthesis will be inhibited. Methotrexate, therefore, inhibits the synthesis of DNA, RNA, thymidylates, and proteins.",

In the case of MTX, the analog might have a therapeutic advantage if MTX polyglutamates are involved primarily in host toxicity. The second approach is through direct inhibitors of FPGS.

None of these compounds were metabolized to the respective polyglutamate derivative as judged by their inability to serve as substrates for CCRF-CEM human leukemia cell folylpolyglutamate synthetase (FPGS) in vitro. All compounds inhibited recombinant human-dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) at nearly equivalent magnitude as MTX. Growth-inhibition studies with H35 hepatoma, Manca human lymphoma, and CCRF-CEM human leukemia cells established greater cytotoxic effects with compounds 3-5 than with compounds 1 and 2. gamma-Methyleneglutamate derivatives 3-5 were transported to H35 hepatoma cells better than MTX or beta-hydroxyglutamate derivatives 1 and 2. Compound 3 was 2.5 times better than MTX in competing with folinic acid transport in H35 hepatoma cells. Compound 1 did not have a significant inhibitory effect on folinic acid transport even at 50 microM under identical conditions. The IC50 for compound 1 against H35-hepatoma cell growth was 8.5-fold higher than MTX. Compounds with the gamma-methyleneglutamate moiety (3-5) exhibited almost equal or lower IC50 values than MTX against the growth of CCRF-CEM human leukemia cells. These studies show that on continuous exposure, the non-polyglutamylatable inhibitors DHFR (3-5) can exhibit superior antifolate activity compared to the polyglutamylatable methotrexate, presumably due to their enhanced transport to these cell lines.

DRM+, a different system based upon the same principles, operates in the VHF band with 100 kHz digital-only bandwidth which allows 700 kbit/s data rate. Actual DRM bit rates vary depending on day versus night transmission (groundwave versus skywave) and the amount of bits dedicated for error correction (signal robustness).",

        "content": "5,10-Dideazatetrahydrofolic acid (DDATHF) is a folate antimetabolite that shows activity against glycinamide ribonucleotide (GAR) transformylase, a folate-requiring enzyme in the de novo purine nucleotide biosynthetic pathway. Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that DDATHF is an effective inducer of the maturation of HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia. In solution, DDATHF is a mixture of two diastereomers due to an asymmetric configuration at carbon 6. Incubation of HL-60 cells with 1 microM of each diastereomer resulted in an inhibition of cellular proliferation after 48 h that preceded an increase in the number of differentiated myeloid cells, as determined by the ability of cells to reduce nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) and by the binding of the myeloid-specific antibody Mo 1. Several analogs of DDATHF were also tested as inducers of the differentiation of HL-60 cells. With the exception of the 10-acetyl analog of 5-deazatetrahydrofolic acid, all compounds displayed similar activities as inducers of maturation. The finding that both stereoisomers of DDATHF, as well as the analogs tested, could selectively reduce intracellular purine nucleotide levels suggested that these compounds inhibited purine nucleotide biosynthesis de novo. This possibility was confirmed by the finding that hypoxanthine completely prevented the reduction of intracellular purine nucleotide levels, as well as the induction of differentiation and the inhibition of cellular growth, by these folate analogs. The results suggest that GAR transformylase is a target for a series of compounds whose structures resemble that of tetrahydrofolate and indicate that the inhibition of GAR transformylase by these compounds is sufficient to induce the maturation of HL-60 leukemia cells.",
