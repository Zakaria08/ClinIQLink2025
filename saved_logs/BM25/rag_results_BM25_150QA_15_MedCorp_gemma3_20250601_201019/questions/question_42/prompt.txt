Document 1 (Title: Alagille syndrome): Heart Common signs of Alagille syndrome include congenital heart problems varying from heart murmurs to significant structural abnormalities, such as Tetralogy of Fallot. Pulmonary Stenosis, overriding aorta, ventricular septal defect, and right ventricular hypertrophy are common amongst Alagille patients. Patients may also present with Ventricular septal defect, Atrial septal defect, Patent ductus arteriosus, and Coarctation of the aorta. The mortality rate of Tetralogy of Fallot when untreated ranges from 70% by age 10 to 95% by age 40. However, complete surgical repair can significantly improve both longevity and quality of life in patients with Alagille syndrome.
Document 2 (Title: Trilogy of Fallot): The Trilogy of Fallot also called Fallot's trilogy is a rare congenital heart disease consisting of the following defects: pulmonary valve stenosis, right ventricular hypertrophy and atrial septal defect. It occurs in 1.2% of all congenital heart defects. A 1960 case report of 22 patients who underwent surgery showed an excess of females with a ratio of 3:2, with the youngest person being 7 months old and the oldest being 50 years old. Symptoms and signs Mechanism Trilogy of Fallot is a combination of three congenital heart defects: pulmonary stenosis, right ventricular hypertrophy, and an atrial septal defect. The first two of these are also found in the more common tetralogy of Fallot. However, the tetralogy has a ventricular septal defect instead of an atrial one, and it also involves an overriding aorta The Three Malformations Diagnosis Diagnosis is done via echocardiography or angiography.

Question: A male neonate is being examined by a pediatrician. His mother informs the doctor that she had a mild fever with rash, muscle pain, and swollen and tender lymph nodes during the second month of gestation. The boy was born at 39 weeks gestation via spontaneous vaginal delivery with no prenatal care. On physical examination, the neonate has normal vital signs. Retinal examination reveals the findings shown in the image. Which of the following congenital heart defects is most likely to be present in this neonate?
Options:
A. Atrial septal defect
B. Ventricular septal defect
C. Tetralogy of Fallot
D. Patent ductus arteriosus
