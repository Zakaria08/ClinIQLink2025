Document 1 (Title: Infectious mononucleosis): Differential diagnosis About 10% of people who present a clinical picture of infectious mononucleosis do not have an acute Epstein–Barr-virus infection. A differential diagnosis of acute infectious mononucleosis needs to take into consideration acute cytomegalovirus infection and Toxoplasma gondii infections. Because their management is much the same, it is not always helpful, or possible, to distinguish between Epstein–Barr-virus mononucleosis and cytomegalovirus infection. However, in pregnant women, differentiation of mononucleosis from toxoplasmosis is important, since it is associated with significant consequences for the fetus. Acute HIV infection can mimic signs similar to those of infectious mononucleosis, and tests should be performed for pregnant women for the same reason as toxoplasmosis.
Document 2 (Title: Infectious mononucleosis): When the infection is acute (recent onset, instead of chronic), heterophile antibodies are produced. Cytomegalovirus, adenovirus and Toxoplasma gondii (toxoplasmosis) infections can cause symptoms similar to infectious mononucleosis, but a heterophile antibody test will test negative and differentiate those infections from infectious mononucleosis. Mononucleosis is sometimes accompanied by secondary cold agglutinin disease, an autoimmune disease in which abnormal circulating antibodies directed against red blood cells can lead to a form of autoimmune hemolytic anemia. The cold agglutinin detected is of anti-i specificity. Diagnosis
Document 3 (Title: Lymphocytosis): Causes of absolute lymphocytosis include: acute viral infections, such as infectious mononucleosis (glandular fever), hepatitis and Cytomegalovirus infection other acute infections such as pertussis some protozoal infections, such as toxoplasmosis and American trypanosomiasis (Chagas disease) chronic intracellular bacterial infections such as tuberculosis or brucellosis chronic lymphocytic leukemia acute lymphoblastic leukemia lymphoma post-splenectomy state CARD11-related congenital B cell lymphocytosis (rare, also known as BENTA disease) Causes of relative lymphocytosis include: age less than 2 years; acute viral infections; connective tissue diseases, thyrotoxicosis, Addison's disease, splenomegaly with splenic sequestration of granulocytes.
Document 4 (Title: Herpesviridae): Nine herpesvirus types are known to primarily infect humans, at least five of which – herpes simplex viruses 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2, also known as HHV-1 and HHV-2; both of which can cause orolabial herpes and genital herpes), varicella zoster virus (or HHV-3; the cause of chickenpox and shingles), Epstein–Barr virus (EBV or HHV-4; implicated in several diseases, including mononucleosis and some cancers), and human cytomegalovirus (HCMV or HHV-5) – are extremely widespread among humans. More than 90% of adults have been infected with at least one of these, and a latent form of the virus remains in almost all humans who have been infected. Other human herpesviruses are human herpesvirus 6A and 6B (HHV-6A and HHV-6B), human herpesvirus 7 (HHV-7), and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV, also known as HHV-8).
Document 5 (Title: Infectious mononucleosis): About 5% to 7% of cases of infectious mononucleosis is caused by human cytomegalovirus (CMV), another type of herpes virus. This virus is found in body fluids including saliva, urine, blood, and tears. A person becomes infected with this virus by direct contact with infected body fluids. Cytomegalovirus is most commonly transmitted through kissing and sexual intercourse. It can also be transferred from an infected mother to her unborn child. This virus is often "silent" because the signs and symptoms cannot be felt by the person infected. However, it can cause life-threatening illness in infants, people with HIV, transplant recipients, and those with weak immune systems. For those with weak immune systems, cytomegalovirus can cause more serious illnesses such as pneumonia and inflammations of the retina, esophagus, liver, large intestine, and brain. Approximately 90% of the human population has been infected with cytomegalovirus by the time they reach adulthood, but most are unaware
