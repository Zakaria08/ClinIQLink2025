Document 1 (Title: Dimercaprol -- Indications): In 1940, Sir Rudolph Albert Peters’ group at the University of Oxford, UK, developed dimercaprol (2,3-dimercapto-1-propanol), also known as British anti-Lewisite (BAL), as an antidote to lewisite, the arsenical chemical weapon used during World War II. [1] Shortly after its development, dimercaprol was also found to be just as effective for other metals such as mercury, gold, lead, and copper.
Document 2 (Title: Arsenic distribution in rabbits after Lewisite administration and treatment with British anti-Lewisite (BAL).): The standard treatment of Lewisite (dichloro(2-chlorovinyl)arsine) poisoning is by chelation with BAL (British anti-Lewisite, dimercaptopropanol). The present study investigated the effect of BAL treatment on the distribution of arsenic after Lewisite administration. Lewisite was administered subcutaneously at the LD10 and LD40 of the compound. Without BAL treatment arsenic was eliminated with a half-life in blood of between 55 and 75 hr and a blood clearance of 120 ml/hr/kg. Arsenic had a large volume of distribution of several liters per kilogram, indicating extensive distribution in tissues. The highest tissue concentrations, more than seven times blood concentrations, were found in the liver, lung, and kidneys. These organs maintained an approximately constant concentration ratio with blood during the sampling period. Concentrations in tissues with a blood-to-tissue barrier, such as the brain and the spinal cord, rose between 4 and 96 hr while blood concentrations declined more than fourfold over the same...
Document 3 (Title: Evaluation of the efficacy of dimercapto chelating agents for the treatment of systemic organic arsenic poisoning in rabbits.): 1 The standard drug for the treatment of arsenic poisoning is BAL (dimercaprol). BAL possesses marked side-effects and a low safety ratio, drawbacks which new BAL analogues, DMPS and DMSA, do not possess. 2 The efficacy of three chelating agents, BAL, DMPS and DMSA, has been evaluated as a treatment for systemic organic arsenic poisoning, induced by intravenous dichloro(2-chlorovinyl)arsine (lewisite) administration to rabbits. Equimolar dosing schedules were used based upon realistic doses for the most toxic agent, BAL. 3 It was concluded that all three dimercapto chelating agents provided significant protection against the lethal systemic effects of lewisite, and, under the test conditions reported here, there was no significant difference between them in therapeutic efficacy. 4 The cause of mortality following intravenous lewisite in treated and untreated rabbits was pulmonary damage. 5 It is considered that DMPS and DMSA are worthy of further study as replacements for BAL in the treatment of systemic pois...
Document 4 (Title: Dimercaprol): Dimercaprol, also called British anti-Lewisite (BAL), is a medication used to treat acute poisoning by arsenic, mercury, gold, and lead. It may also be used for antimony, thallium, or bismuth poisoning, although the evidence for those uses is not very strong. It is given by injection into a muscle. Common side effects include high blood pressure, pain at the site of the injection, vomiting, and fever. It is not recommended for people with peanut allergies as it is typically formulated as a suspension in peanut oil. It is unclear if use in pregnancy is safe for the baby. Dimercaprol is a chelator and works by binding with heavy metals. It has a very, pungent odor. Dimercaprol was first made during World War II. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines.
Document 5 (Title: Antidotes -- Clinical Significance -- Treatment and Antidotes): Heavy metals : Heavy metal toxicity treatment is with chelation therapy. For lead toxicity dimercaprol (British anti-lewisite, BAL), edetate calcium disodium, and succimer are the most common options. A fourth agent, penicillamine is less frequently used as it carries a risk of interstitial nephritis. For severe symptoms including encephalopathy, dimercaprol is the agent of choice at a dosage of 75mg/m2 every 4 hours for five days. [22] For mild or asymptomatic cases succimer is the agent of choice as it is available in an oral preparation. Mercury and arsenic toxicity receive similar treatment. Dimercaprol was also the first antidote to arsenic nerve gas, but its use in arsenic toxicity has largely been supplanted by dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA or succimer) and dimercaptopropane sulfonate, water-soluble derivatives of dimercaprol. [40] DMPS has not yet been approved by the FDA for use in the United States but is the agent of choice outside of the US. Despite the newer agents, dimercaprol is still the most ...
