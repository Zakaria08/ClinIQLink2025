Document 1 (Title: Pulmonary edema): Pulmonary edema (PE), also known as pulmonary congestion, is liquid accumulation in the tissue and air spaces of the lungs. It leads to impaired gas exchange and may cause respiratory failure. It is due to either failure of the left ventricle of the heart to remove blood adequately from the pulmonary circulation (cardiogenic pulmonary edema), or an injury to the lung tissue or blood vessels of the lung (non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema). Treatment is focused on three aspects: firstly improving respiratory function, secondly, treating the underlying cause, and thirdly avoiding further damage to the lung. Pulmonary edema, especially when sudden (acute), can lead to respiratory failure or cardiac arrest due to hypoxia. It is a cardinal feature of congestive heart failure. The term edema is from the Greek (oidēma, "swelling"), from οἰδέω (oidéō, "(I) swell").
Document 2 (Title: Ortner's syndrome): Aortic dissection More commonly affects the right recurrent laryngeal nerve as the most common type of aortic dissection is type A (Figure 2). Pseudoaneurysm Notable case: A male with long-standing uncontrolled hypertension and hoarseness of voice attributed to life-long smoking was found to have a pseudoaneurysm of the aortic arch which was compressing the LRLN. Pulmonary disease: Pathophysiology: Due to vascular congestion in the lung, the pulmonary artery (Figure 3) becomes dilated and can compress the aorta and the LRLN. Primary pulmonary hypertension Pulmonary emboli Malignancy (pulmonary, mediastinal) Autoimmune: Mixed connective tissue disease Notable case: A young female with a history of mixed connective tissue disease presented with hoarseness of voice and was found to have secondary pulmonary artery hypertension. This was causing right heart enlargement and therefore compression of the LRLN. Idiopathic
Document 3 (Title: Pulmonary hypertension): Diagnosis In terms of the diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension, it has five major types, and a series of tests must be performed to distinguish pulmonary arterial hypertension from venous, hypoxic, thromboembolic, or unclear multifactorial varieties. PAH is diagnosed after exclusion of other possible causes of pulmonary hypertension. Physical examination A physical examination is performed to look for typical signs of pulmonary hypertension (described above), and a detailed family history is established to determine whether the disease might be heritable. A history of exposure to drugs such as benfluorex (a fenfluramine derivative), dasatinib, cocaine, methamphetamine, ethanol leading to cirrhosis, and tobacco leading to emphysema is considered significant. Use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors during pregnancy (particularly late pregnancy) is associated with an increased risk of the baby developing persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn.
Document 4 (Title: Mixed connective tissue disease): Cardiac disease: Pericarditis is the most common cardiac manifestation, observed in 10–30% of patients. Myocardial involvement can also be observed, usually secondary to pulmonary hypertension, as well as conduction anomalies. Pulmonary involvement: Is observed in 75% of patients. It can present as pleural effusion, pulmonary hypertension, interstitial lung disease, thromboembolic disease, and others. Renal disease: The absence of severe renal disease is a marker of MCTD. Membranous nephropathy can be observed in some cases. Gastrointestinal disease: The most common change is the alteration of esophageal motility like that observed in scleroderma. Central nervous system involvement (CNS): The original description of this disease stressed the absence of changes to the CNS; however, there have been trigeminal neuropathies (cranial nerve V), sensorineural hearing loss, and headaches observed in patients with MCTD.
Document 5 (Title: Pulmonary hypertension): Treatment Treatment of pulmonary hypertension is determined by whether the PH is arterial, venous, hypoxic, thromboembolic, or miscellaneous. If it is caused by left heart disease, the treatment is to optimize left ventricular function by the use of medication or to repair/replace the mitral valve or aortic valve. Patients with left heart failure or hypoxemic lung diseases (groups II or III pulmonary hypertension) should not routinely be treated with vasoactive agents including prostanoids, phosphodiesterase inhibitors, or endothelin antagonists, as these are approved for the different condition called primary pulmonary arterial hypertension. To make the distinction, doctors at a minimum will conduct cardiac catheterization of the right heart, echocardiography, chest CT, a six-minute walk test, and pulmonary function testing. Using treatments for other kinds of pulmonary hypertension in patients with these conditions can harm the patient and wastes substantial medical resources.

Question: A pulmonary autopsy specimen from a 58-year-old woman who died of acute hypoxic respiratory failure was examined. She had recently undergone surgery for a fractured femur 3 months ago. Initial hospital course was uncomplicated, and she was discharged to a rehab facility in good health. Shortly after discharge home from rehab, she developed sudden shortness of breath and had cardiac arrest. Resuscitation was unsuccessful. On histological examination of lung tissue, fibrous connective tissue around the lumen of the pulmonary artery is observed. Which of the following is the most likely pathogenesis for the present findings?
Options:
A. Thromboembolism
B. Pulmonary ischemia
C. Pulmonary hypertension
D. Pulmonary passive congestion
