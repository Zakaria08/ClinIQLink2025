Document 1 (Title: Disembowelment): When a portion of the intestinal tract is forcefully pulled from or expelled from the body through the anus, it is referred to as transanal evisceration. Following the first report of transanal evisceration by Brodie in 1827, more than 70 cases have been reported to date, the majority occurring spontaneously in elderly individuals. Straining, chronic constipation, and rectal ulcerations predispose to spontaneous perforation in elderly individuals. Cases of transanal evisceration of children whilst sitting over uncovered swimming pool drains have been reported; notable cases include Valerie Lakey (1993) and Abigail Taylor (2007). In Taylor's case, the suction dislodged and damaged her liver and pancreas; several meters of her small intestine were forcefully pulled through her anus. In both these cases, the victims were left with short bowel syndrome and required feeding by total parenteral nutrition. After multiple operations, Taylor later died from transplant-related cancer.
Document 2 (Title: Hole preparation techniques for transpedicle screws. Effect on pull-out strength from human cadaveric vertebrae.): In each of eight thoracolumbar human cadaveric vertebrae, a hole was made through one pedicle into the vertebral body with a drill bit and through the contralateral pedicle with a probe. Identical metal screws were implanted into the holes to equal depths, and maximum pull-out force was determined for each screw. Using a paired Student t test, no significant difference (P = 0.87) was found in pull-out strength between the screws implanted into drilled holes and those implanted into probed holes. In fact, the average pull-out strengths for the two groups differed by less than 2%. The pedicular cortex was broken through during hole preparation in 5 of the 16 pedicles: 3 as a result of drilling and 2 secondary to probing. The average pull-out strength of the screws in these five pedicles was 11.0% less than the average pull-out strength of the screws implanted into the contralateral intact pedicles. Although this does not represent a statistically significant difference (P = 0.15), it suggests that damaging the ...
Document 3 (Title: Anterior perineal approach and three-flap anoplasty for imperforate anus: optimal reconstruction with minimal destruction.): Despite progress in the treatment of imperforate anus, anal stenosis, rectal prolapse, and other late complications may still arise. In 1987, we described the three-flap anoplasty for the treatment of rectal prolapse following pull-through operations. Since 1986, we have performed 14 three-flap anoplasties in combination with an anterior perineal rectal pull-through for primary treatment of imperforate anus. The mean age at definitive repair was 4.4 months (range, 0 to 14 months). Eleven of the 14 primary pull-through procedures could be performed through a perineal approach only. There were no deaths. At a mean follow-up of 24.2 months, none of the patients has developed prolapse, and only one has had a temporary stenosis. Three children are already fully continent, and soiling is absent in 12. All have a good sphincter tone. Although it is too early to evaluate long-term results, it appears that the three-flap anoplasty prevents mucosal prolapse through the interposition of a skin-lined anal canal. Moreover...
Document 4 (Title: Hirschsprung's disease in adolescents and adults.): Hirschsprung's disease in the adolescent and adult is a rare and often misdiagnosed cause of lifelong refractory constipation. Two adolescent and three adult patients with Hirschsprung's disease treated between 1973 and 1987 at the University of Michigan Medical Center are reported. Each patient presented with chronic constipation requiring enemas, cathartics, and multiple hospital admissions for management. Diagnosis in each case was made with barium enema and full-thickness rectal biopsy. Four patients underwent endorectal pull-through procedures, all with good long-term results. The fifth patient, initially treated with a Duhamel retrorectal pull-through procedure, required reoperation for constipation secondary to a retained rectal septum. Review of 199 cases of adult Hirschsprung's disease enables comparison of the various operative procedures for this disorder with respect to postoperative complications and functional outcomes. Anorectal myectomy with low anterior resection, the Duhamel-Martin procedure...
Document 5 (Title: Transabdominal operation for carcinoma of the gastric cardia: application of pulling-up retractor and EEA stapler.): In order to ascertain the advantages of the combined use of the pulling-up retractor and EEA stapler, we reviewed 88 patients who underwent surgery for upper stomach cancer between 1978 and 1986. The length of resected esophagus was significantly longer in patients operated on using an abdominal approach with this combination, as in those using a thoracoabdominal approach, than in those who were operated on using an abdominal approach with only the retractor or without the instruments (p less than 0.05). A relatively high incidence of leakage occurred at the anastomosis of the esophagus to the stomach or jejunum following operation using a transabdominal approach without the instruments. Pulmonary complication tended to be decreased in the non-thoracotomized patients compared to the thoracotomized patients. Postoperative radiogram following the combined use showed an esophagogastrostomy at a high level in the mediastinum. Our combination technique enables lymphadenectomy in the lower mediastinum and a suffici...
