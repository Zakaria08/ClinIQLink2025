        "content": "This case history charts the treatment of a preschooler who first presented at the age of three years and ten months with aggressive and self-destructive behaviors. During the initial months of treatment, the therapist focused upon establishing a therapeutic alliance with the child in order to evoke a transference reaction. Compelling evidence of the transference in this case occurred in the ninth month of treatment when the therapist told the child that she would be going on vacation. The child, whose own mother had abandoned him several times, responded with uncharacteristic physical and verbal abuse. Although the child engaged in aggressive and self-destructive play enactments almost from the onset of treatment, these behaviors intensified from the fifth month of treatment onwards, as it became evident that he had entered the working-through phase. Aggressive impulses were shown in his manipulation of toys and other objects, and self-destructive episodes emerged in the child's incessant efforts to jump from chairs and tables, as well as in repeated threats to \"shoot\" himself with a toy gun. The therapist was sensitive to the child's need to continually repeat and gradually modify these behaviors. She permitted their display without exhibiting shock or alarm, but at the same time, expressed concern for the child's safety and reinforced this concern by setting limits on his unacceptable behavior. Gradually, the child's self-destructive and aggressive tendencies abated. Further evidence that the conflict had been worked through was also seen in the child's ability to express a more realistic assessment of his home environment, one which reconciled the conflict between \"good\" and \"bad\" impulses. This advancement in perception was demonstrated by the child's verbal recognition that while his mother was capable of doing \"bad\" things, she was still his mother and he loved her. Prior to the termination of treatment, both the child's grandmother and teachers reported significant improvement in the child's behavior and linguistic abilities.",

        "content": "The emotional impact of serious illness or injury bears just as much potential for being disabling to an adolescent as does the condition itself. It is also these concerns and the possibilities for difficult behavior on the part of teenagers on the ward which frequently cause staff members to feel at a loss when caring for this reputedly difficult age group. But if one carefully examines the specific developmental stresses of illness and the various coping mechanisms by which the youth may counter them, a logical management approach emerges. To a large degree this approach depends on compensation, intellectualization, displacement and constructive denial but also recognizes that destructive denial, regression and projection do normally and naturally occur at various points in the course of illness and hospitalization and that panic and acting out may also readily occur, but less frequently. The deterence of the more deleterious responses and promotion of the more felicitious dependes on a ward setting which provides for the adolescent's growing need for independence and self-determination; for continued reassurance about body image integrity, for resumption of mastery and control; and for the maintenance or restoration of his sense of self-worth. These goals are achieved by encouraging the youth to be an active partner in his own care; to share in decisions made about his condition; to pursue just as much independent self-management as he can; to actively engage in establishing a peer group with other adolescents in the ward; to continue with his education, socialization, personal interests and outside peer contacts as much as possible; and to feel that the staff respects his dignity and privacy, likes him as a person and appreciates the courage and effort with which he is facing a difficult time.",

        "content": "This essay traces a prominent facet of Freud's personality, his being a \"mighty warrior\" throughout his life. This aspect of his character evolved as a reaction formation against his submissive father and as an identification with his more aggressive mother. He first tried it out in his highly ambivalent relationship to his nephew John, who was one year older. In his childhood play, Freud identified with certain military heroes, such mighty warriors as Napoleon, Hannibal, Alexander the Great, and Massena. As he grew older he shifted from military heroes to other great men including Goethe, Shakespeare, and finally Moses. He substituted these men as ego ideals in place of his father about whose stature he felt disillusioned. He far surpassed his father in his life achievements and yet managed to maintain an even-handed, respectable relationship with him until he died in 1896. His mother all but worshipped Sigmund but also demanded that he achieved the maximum in whatever he did. He had to earn her love by an outstanding performance but always wanted to feel unconditionally loved. His mighty warrior attitude developed into an important part of its personality. It protected him from feelings of helplessness and inadequacy and made him into an outstanding leader of the psychoanalytic movement.",

        "content": "We know quite a lot about the life of the oculist Joseph Hillmer of Vienna between 1746-1775, especially from newspapers of that time. In 1748, Frederic II of Prussia appointed him to a professorship at the Berlin Collegium Medico-Chirurgicum, where his duties were to lecture on ophthalmiatrics twice a week. In 1751 he travelled via Livonia and Estonia to St. Petersburg. After 4 months he was denounced as a charlatan. The First Physician at the court of the Tsarina Elisabeth, Herman Kaau Boerhaave, acting in his capacity as director of the Medical Chancelry at Petersburg (the Russian medical supervising board), had Hillmer expelled from the Russian empire. He also collected all the documents relating to the affair and published them as a book at his expense. The Tsarina suppressed the book, which contained case reports on 125 of Hillmer's patients. There is much to indicate that she was motivated by tactical diplomacy, since the oculist had been involved in such matters by the Prussian king during the preliminaries to the Third Silestan War (1756-1763). Hillmer never held a single lecture during his period of tenure as a professor in Berlin, and there is very little evidence of his ever having practised there. Nonetheless, he had owned a large house near the Berlin castle which he also extended to allow its use for public concerts and festivities. During the summer he let the house while traveling extensively throughout Europe and attending patients in many different places, so that he lived in the house only in winter. After his return from Russia he sold his horses and, later, also his coach.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "content": "In the early 1900s, Adler became an imperative figure in the history of psychotherapy. He was an initial supporter and fellow of Sigmund Freud, who invited Adler to collaborate with the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society, where he served as leader and co-editor. During this time, his work focused on abnormal human behavior and appeared psychoanalytic. After some time, Adler elaborated his hypotheses on the nature of humankind, which caused significant theoretical disagreement with Freud. Following his ideology, he disclosed a novel doctrine and practice of counseling that emerged as a unification of cognitive, existential-humanistic, systemic, and psychodynamic viewpoints. He reaffirmed his theories during World War I by serving his country as a military doctor. This experience profoundly affected him. [1] As a result, Adler became more interested in standard human behavior, allowing him to establish several child guidance clinics in Vienna. For this reason, he developed a relatively small but significant following. His therapeutic methods became more encouragement-focused after the war, emphasizing human strengths and abilities. This postwar advisory technique was the fundamental basis of Adlerian psychotherapy. In 1935, Adler sought refuge in the United States with a hypothesis about a community of social equals. Although he taught and lectured extensively in the United States, his followers found substantial resistance from those who adopted Freud's psychoanalysis. [4]",

An early maturer, this student experienced early success in several sports without a great deal of effort and investment, and derived much of his sense of being from the recognition and reinforcement accorded him by significant others, most notably from a father who placed a higher premium on success in athletics than on other equally worthwhile pursuits. When continued success was not forthcoming, and as later-maturing peers caught up to and surpassed his athletic accomplishments, the student sought to protect his sense of self-esteem by rationalizing that his lack of success was due to a physical problem. He became obsessed with the thought that he was gradually losing his athletic identity and he lapsed deeper and deeper into a depressed state. His compulsive overtraining and starvation diet failed to produce his image of the \"ideal body\" that, of course, was unachievable because of his distorted view of reality. Ultimately, this behavior resulted in hospitalization for treatment of an eating disorder and clinical depression. Even a successful senior football season after his psychiatric care could not filter through his distorted perceptions and he could not cope with the thought of participating in another track and field season and having his performance bested by others whom he had once handily beaten. Thus, once again, he engaged in self-protective behavior and sought verification from sportsmedicine professionals. Diagnosis of Tom's condition was possible only through the collaborative efforts of the athletic trainer, physical therapist, sport psychologist, and family physician. Professionals involved in sportsmedicine must be aware of the critical role that highly valued activities like sports play in the psychosocial development of adolescents. To the adult, these activities may seem trivial, frivolous, and removed from the \"real world,\" but to the adolescent, they are an important source of self-esteem during a critical and volatile period of self-concept edification. During a period of awakening sexuality and heightened awareness of their physical being, activities that emphasize the physical aspect of self gain prominence.

        "content": "Psychoanalysis of a man with active alcoholism, who is able to resume recreational drinking, has never been described. Mr. A. began treatment in denial of his alcoholism. Analysis demonstrated an underlying splitting between his experiencing and observing ego. His analyst received a projection of his observing ego, the part that was worried about his drinking. Because this split was resolved within a therapeutic alliance, Mr. A. decided that he had been attacking and punishing himself with alcohol, and he elected to abstain from alcohol entirely. The first key event that lead up to this dramatic decision was a sense that his analyst was a separate person. The second, arriving for discussion within the analysis through a dream, was his conviction that he would have to choose either to continue to drink with loss of control at the cost of his analysis or that he would have to choose to continue analysis at the expense of having to stop drinking. Mr. A. then came to feel that his analyst was attacking and punishing him with a fee increase. After 15 months of complete abstinence, Mr. A. found that he could drink with rare symptoms, but he still felt saddled with an abusive analyst. Mr. A.'s rages about the fee came up most commonly right after weekend or vacation breaks in the analysis. But the interpretation of these rages as related to missing me were contemptuously regarded as attempts to force him into my psychoanalytic schema rather than regarding his experience as valid. There was a dramatic shift of our alliance when Mr. A. was given complete control over the fee. I was freed to interpret and reconstruct the underlying early relationship with his parents. The final part of this article describes Mr. A.'s working-through process, which stabilized his sense of autonomy and which reconstructed his early relationship with his parents. Mr. A. became convinced that it was up to him exactly how, when, and how much to drink. Drinking too much led to consequences that he chose not to endure.",

Mr. A.'s rages about the fee came up most commonly right after weekend or vacation breaks in the analysis. But the interpretation of these rages as related to missing me were contemptuously regarded as attempts to force him into my psychoanalytic schema rather than regarding his experience as valid. There was a dramatic shift of our alliance when Mr. A. was given complete control over the fee. I was freed to interpret and reconstruct the underlying early relationship with his parents. The final part of this article describes Mr. A.'s working-through process, which stabilized his sense of autonomy and which reconstructed his early relationship with his parents. Mr. A. became convinced that it was up to him exactly how, when, and how much to drink. Drinking too much led to consequences that he chose not to endure.",

        "content": "The elderly patient, who is phobic or exceedingly anxious established behavior patterns years ago when dentistry was not as advanced as today and when dental experiences were unpleasant and uncomfortable. The elderly phobic patient may view his role as a passive participant as he was in his youth; that is, he fears that the dentist will treat him as he was treated by an unsympathetic dentist years ago. In order to create acceptable, positive experiences for the phobic or anxious patient, the first appointment should give the patient an opportunity to know the dentist and office staff. The dentist can take this opportunity to reassure the patient that pain does not have to be a part of dental treatment. It is imperative that the dentist and staff involve the patient and instill trust. One must always have the patient's perspective in mind and constantly, by word or deed, assure the patient that he will always be in control of decisions and treatment. The dentist must not view the geriatric patient as different from his other patients. He or she must be perceptive and deliberate in the initial encounter and early relationship and determine what is the best treatment for that patient. The dentist must be realistic about the goals and requirements of that patient, for whom the dentist's ultimate objective should be to achieve quality dental care, done expeditiously, without fear and pain.",

        "content": "His physical exam revealed clear lungs and a normal heart exam on auscultation. His abdomen was soft and non-tender, and his skin was warm and dry with no rash. He had 2 plus pitting edema at the ankles. Initial laboratory data was consistent with acute kidney injury (AKI) with worsening creatinine from 1.2 to 1.6 over 1 month and nephrotic range proteinuria. Serologies for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, anti-nuclear antibody (ANA), c-ANCA, serine protease 3 (PR3) IgG, myeloperoxidase antibody (MPO), and complement levels were sent. He was started on losartan for proteinuria with plans for renal biopsy; however, he was lost to follow up. The patient then presented two weeks later with worsening edema to his waist, continued weight gain, mild hemoptysis, and streaks of blood in the stool. Physical examination now showed worsening pitting edema up to his waist with new non-pruritic, erythematous excoriations on the medial aspect of his thighs bilaterally. He was admitted to the hospital with concern for worsening vasculitis. He was started on oral prednisone and underwent a renal biopsy. For his edema, he was started on diuretics to which he responded well. Due to persistent leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing was performed to complete the workup.",
