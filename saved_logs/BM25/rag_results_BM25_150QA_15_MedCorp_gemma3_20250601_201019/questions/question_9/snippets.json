        "content": "Several reports suggest that chronic beta blockade, most often with the beta 1 selective agent metoprolol, may improve hemodynamic and clinical function in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. However, controlled trials are limited and some studies have not shown beneficial effects in short term trials. Mechanisms of effectiveness are still debated and probably concern the capacity to avoid toxic myocardial damage by catecholamines, to induce receptor up-regulation, to contribute to the control of arrhythmias, to improve diastolic relaxation and other mechanisms. After a revision of the literature, a preliminary clinical experience with metoprolol in dilated cardiomyopathy diagnosed according to the WHO definition is reported. Sixty-seven patients symptomatic for congestive heart failure or with complex ventricular arrhythmias associated with severe left ventricular dysfunction were submitted to test dose with metoprolol 5 mg bid for 2-7 days. All patients were completely studied, including coronary angiography and endomyocardial biopsy to exclude ischemic heart disease and active myocarditis. Four pts (6%) did not tolerate the first test dosage of metoprolol and twenty-two patients were excluded from analysis because of inadequate follow-up or because they were enrolled in an international trial. Forty-one patients underwent long-term treatment with metoprolol at a final mean dosage of 150 mg a day (range 50-200 mg) and are presently analyzed. The dosage was gradually increased during the first seven weeks. After 6 +/- 2 months and 12 +/- 2 months, 34 patients were stable or ameliorated (Group 1) and experienced an overall significant improvement of functional class (all pts in class I-II NYHA), of left and right ventricular ejection fraction (from 28 +/- 8.8% to 35.8 +/- 13.7% to 33.2 +/- 12.3% and from 38.6 +/- 11.8% to 42.4 +/- 5.8% to 45.2 +/- 12.2% respectively), of clinical signs of congestive heart failure, of cardiothoracic index, of left ventricular diameters and of arrhythmic pattern. Furthermore, the rate of ventricular couplets &gt; 20/24h and of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia changed respectively from 46% and 54% to 4% and 21% at 12 +/- 2 months. None in Group 1 died nor is any waiting for heart transplantation. Eleven patients (Group 2) did not tolerate the drug acutely (4 pts) or deteriorated during the first 6 +/- 2 months (7 pts) of the treatment. In this group a worsening or an insignificant variation of all clinical and instrumental parameters was observed. During follow-up four patients of this group underwent heart transplantation (one died shortly after the operation because of infective complications), one died while waiting, two are currently waiting for heart transplantation, and three are still in heart failure (class III NYHA).

Before and 2.5 h after application of pimobendan left ventricular volumes and left ventricular dP/dtmax were evaluated by left heart catheterization. Right atrial pressure (RAP), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCP), cardiac output (CO), heart rate, and systemic blood pressure were assessed before and 2.5, 4, and 6 h after administration of pimobendan. PCP was reduced from 12.2 +/- 7.5 to 8.3 +/- 7.1 mm Hg (p less than 0.05) by 5 mg of pimobendan, and from 18.3 +/- 6.2 to 6.2 +/- 3.4 mm Hg (p less than 0.005) by 10 mg of pimobendan. Reduction of RAP was significant only in group II (from 6.2 +/- 3.2 to 1.2 +/- 0.9 mm Hg; p less than 0.05). In contrast to other hemodynamic parameters, the significant increase of CO exhibited no dose-dependency. Only 10 mg of pimobendan induced a temporary reduction of mean arterial blood pressure. An increase in heart rate occurred only in group I and was merely transient. Left ventricular end diastolic and end systolic volume indices were clearly reduced by 5 mg as well as by 10 mg of pimobendan.

        "title": "Regular ventricular rhythms in patients with symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.",
        "content": "Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is a grossly irregular tachycardia. Forty-nine patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation who were taking a variety of antiarrhythmic medications including the class IC agents propafenone and flecainide were followed up for a median of 371 days with use of transtelephonic electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring to document symptomatic rhythms. Eighteen patients had 96 episodes of regular tachycardia; the cumulative incidence rate was 25% at 6 months, 33% at 1 year and 41% at 18 months. Eighty of the 96 episodes occurred with a heart rate less than or equal to 180 beats/min and could have been explained by atrial flutter with 2:1 block. However, nine patients had a total of 16 episodes with a rate greater than 180 beats/min that were probably not due to atrial flutter with block; the cumulative incidence rate of these fast regular tachycardias was 14% at 6 months, 17% at 1 year and 25% at 18 months. QRS duration during the first episode of regular tachycardia was significantly longer in patients taking a class IC drug (median 105 vs 90 ms, p less than 0.001 Wilcoxon rank sum test). In contrast to drug therapy with amiodarone or the combination of digoxin and verapamil, the QRS duration of regular tachycardias during class IC therapy was directly related to the tachycardia heart rate (Spearman's rank, p less than 0.01). All episodes of fast, regular tachycardias with a QRS duration greater than 120 ms occurred in patients taking a class IC drug. Clinicians treating patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation should expect a substantial incidence of regular tachycardia in addition to atrial fibrillation.",

        "content": "The appearance of impaired left ventricular diastolic function in chronic ischemic heart disease often precedes systolic dysfunction. Myocardial ischemia and increased calcium loading have been implicated in the genesis of increased left ventricular stiffness. We have assessed the effects of long-term therapy with different classes of calcium channel-blocking drugs on left ventricular peak filling rate in patients with chronic stable angina and congestive heart failure secondary to ischemic heart disease. Therapeutic effects of nicardipine (30 mg t.i.d.), nisoldipine (10 mg b.i.d.), and verapamil (120 mg t.i.d.) (4 weeks) have been assessed on radionuclide left ventricular diastolic filling parameters in patients with chronic stable angina using placebo-controlled studies. All three drugs significantly improved exercise capacity as compared with placebo. Verapamil produced significant improvements in peak filling rate (p less than 0.005), time to peak filling rate (p less than 0.01), and first one-third filling fraction (p less than 0.005), whereas nicardipine only improved peak filling rate (p less than 0.005); neither drug altered the mean ejection fraction (n = 20). Nisoldipine did not significantly alter diastolic filling parameters or ejection fraction (n = 10). Nisoldipine and digoxin were also assessed in congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association [NYHA] classes II and III) associated with ischemic heart disease (n = 26) (open parallel design). Neither produced significant alterations in peak filling rate and ejection fraction after 3 months of therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
