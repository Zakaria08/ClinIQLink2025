Document 1 (Title: Can road traffic law enforcement permanently reduce the number of accidents?): In this paper it is argued that conventional analyses of road user adaptation to traffic law enforcement, based on parametric rational-choice theory, are flawed. Such analyses only consider road-user actions as a response to enforcement level and penalty size and do not simultaneously consider enforcement as a response to road-user behaviour. If each party is considered a rational agent who adapts to the other's behaviour, the proper way to analyze the outcomes is by the way of game theory. A game-theoretic model is presented and the main implications are: (i) most attempts at enforcing road traffic legislation will not have any lasting effects, either on road-user behaviour or on accidents; (ii) imposing stricter penalties (in the form of higher fines or longer prison sentences) will not affect road-user behaviour; (iii) imposing stricter penalties will reduce the level of enforcement; (iv) implementing automatic traffic surveillance techniques and/or allocating enforcement resources according to a chance me...
Document 2 (Title: Roles and expectations for mental health professionals in law enforcement agencies.): To assess consumer needs for and attitudes toward mental health services within law enforcement agencies, a questionnaire composed of a comprehensive list of mental health services potentially available to police departments was administered to populations of police officers and mental health workers. Respondents rated the services according to perceived utility of the service for law enforcement needs. Generally, police officers seemed receptive to several kinds of mental health  service, although they were less enthusiastic about the value of the services than professionals. The implication of these data for the community mental health worker are discussed in terms of establishing and maintaining effective, mutually satisfying relationships with law enforcement agencies.
Document 3 (Title: Drug control strategies of United States law enforcement.): The American approach to drug control is conditioned by several national characteristics, including fragmentation of the law enforcement system, a 12,000-mile international boundary and a legal system that restricts police authority to search, arrest, detain, eavesdrop and maintain intelligence files. Drug problems in the United States, though, are by all accounts greater than in any other country. Enforcement has traditionally emphasized street-level arrests, investigation of distribution networks, crop eradication and smuggling interdiction. These practices can be shown to produce arrests and seizures, but there is little evidence to show that they reduce drug supply or drug abuse. More contemporary and promising approaches include community policing, problem-oriented policing, financially oriented investigations, increased international co-operation and a renewed emphasis on drug demand reduction. The most pressing needs in law enforcement are (a) improved intelligence-gathering and analysis and (b) resear...
