        "content": "Child abuse, a clinical condition in young children who have received serious physical abuse, is a frequent cause of permanent injury or death. The first case is a 7-year-old boy suffering from abdominal distension and pain for 3 days. He was beaten by his mother as a result of inadequately learning his lessons. Sonogram and CT of the abdomen showed massive ascites and a pseudocyst of the pancreatic body about 3 x 3 cm in diameter. The second case is a 4-year-old girl who developed a semicomatose state after her father impulsively struck her with a chair. CT of the brain revealed subdural hematoma over the left fronto-temporal region and midline shift to the right. She expired 5 days later. The third case, a 2-year-old girl, suffered from headache, seizure, vomiting and general malaise. CT of the brain showed severe brain swelling over the right side and midline shift to the left. She expired 1 month later. Psychiatric factors are probably of prime importance in the pathogenesis of the disorder, but our knowledge of these factors is limited. Parents who inflict abuse on children do not necessarily have psychopathic or sociopathic personalities or come from borderline socioeconomic groups, although most published cases fall into one of these categories. It is clearly the responsibility of all physicians serving children to be aware of, to recognize, and to properly manage any child who has been the victim of abuse.",

        "title": "[Long-term nasogastric feeding and complications of acute gastric ulcer in two elderly patients].",
        "content": "Some elderly patients with chronic illness such as stroke, or Parkinsonism cannot take food orally because of dysphagia. In such cases, tube feeding can be used as a supplement to oral intake when malnutrition is present. This route allows for easier nursing care and decreases the frequency of aspiration pneumonia. Complications of tube feeding include nutrient deficiency states, pulmonary aspiration, gastrointestinal and metabolic disorders. We report two cases with complications of acute gastric ulcer which was thought to be induced with long-term tube feeding. Case 1 was a 61-year-old male patient with Parkinson's disease for ten years. L-DOPA had been administered with good control of his condition. However, his ability to swallow has deteriorated gradually. As he often suffered from aspiration pneumonia, nasogastric tube feeding was performed. After three years of tube feeding, he suddenly vomited much bloody material. He died from massive bleeding with acute gastric dilatation. Autopsy showed giant acute gastric ulcer covered with coagulated blood. UL3, 50 mm in maximum diameter, was observed in the middle portion of the greater curvature, where the top of tube probably came in contact with the gastric wall. Case 2 was an 83-year-old female patient with stroke and chronic heart failure. She had been hospitalized for about one year because of the intermittent deterioration of her cardiac condition. Furthermore, her inability to swallow increased during her hospitalization. She also suffered from aspiration pneumonia. Nasogastric tube feeding was performed to prevent aspiration pneumonia and malnutrition. She died of acute heart failure after twelve months. Autopsy revealed heart dilatation, old myocardial infarction and stroke. In addition, two acute gastric ulcers (UL3.10 and 30 mm in diameter) were recognized; one was in the upper portion of the greater curvature, the other in the lower portion of the greater curvature. The location of these gastric ulcers was unusual. Moreover, they coincided with location of top of the nasogastric tube. From these two cases, we conclude that in long-term tube feeding the tip of the tube often comes in contact with the gastric wall, and gastric ulcer could be produced by repeated mechanical stimulus of the wall. Reports of acute gastric ulcer induced by tube feeding have not been published previously. Therefore, we should pay much attention to this complication in the care of the elderly people with long-term tube feeding.",

        "content": "By three weeks of age, the human neonate demonstrates behaviours which are quite different with an object and with a human interactant. He also demonstrates an expectancy for interaction with his caregiver which has clearly defined limits, as demonstrated behaviourally. In microanalysis of videotape, we saw regularly a set of interactive behaviours which were demonstrable in optimal face-to-face interaction between infants and their mothers. All parts of the infant's body move in smooth circular patterns as he attends to her. His face-to-face attention to her is rhythmic with approach-withdrawal cycling of extremities. The attention phase and build-up to her cues are followed by turning away and a recovery phase in a rhythm of attention-non-attention which seems to define a cyclical homeostatic curve of attention, averaging several cycles per minute. When she violates his expectancy for rhythmic interaction by presenting a still, unresponsive face to him, he becomes visibly concerned, his movements become jerky, he averts his face, then attempts to draw her into interaction. When repeated attempts fail, he finally withdraws into an attitude of helplessness, face averted, body curled up and motionless. If she returns to her usual interactive responses, he comes alive after an initial puzzled period, and returns to his rhythmic cyclical behaviour which has previously characterized their ongoing face-to-face interaction. This attentional cycling may be diagnostic of optimal mother-infant interactions and seems not to be present in more disturbed interactions.",

His ECG showed left axis deviation, first degree AV block, abnormal Q waves in the left precordial leads, and disappearance of septal q waves in the left precordial leads. His exercise capacity was found to be more than 12 METS by treadmill exercise testing. His roentgenogram revealed an egg-shaped ventricle with normal CTR (45%). The following findings were obtained by two-dimensional echocardiogram and heart catheterization: 1) the functional left ventricle had the characteristics of the anatomical right ventricle, 2) The positions of the left and right atrioventricular valves were reversed, 3) Other cardiac anomalies such as VSD, pulmonary stenosis, tricuspid regurgitation (TR) were not proved.

Prognosis of CTGA without any defects is dependent on the appearance of TR, advanced AV block, and congestive heart failure. As these later fatal complications are observed very often, it is important to detect the patient of CTGA accurately.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "content": "A breast-fed boy, born to first-cousin parents, had been vomiting since birth; his general condition remained good until age 6 weeks when vomiting became more frequent, and his status suddenly worsened, with polypnea, shock, hypothermia, jaundice, presence of blood in urine, gastric juice, stool, and bleeding tendency during veno-punctures. There was an huge hepatomegaly and a splenomegaly. Hypoglycaemia, metabolic acidosis, severe blood coagulation disturbances, elevated liver enzymes, hypoalbuminemia, pointed to an acute liver failure. He was resuscitated with current supportive measures, and was given a wide spectrum antibiotherapy. Because serologic tests for syphilis were positive in the child and his mother, including the presence of specific IgM the infant was then given Penicillin G therapy only, which resulted in a complete recovery. One month later, a needle liver biopsy showed residual signs of hepatitis. Other possible infectious or metabolic causes of acute liver failure occurring early in life had been excluded.",

        "content": "The author experienced two cases who showed visual hallucinations after they had had CT-proven cerebral infarctions in the left fronto-medial lobe. Cerebral angiography evidenced the occlusion of the left anterior cerebral artery at the genu portion (case 1) and after branching the frontopolar artery (case 2). Case 1 was a 50 year old national rail way officer who had neither past history of a drug abuse nor that of psychoses. His initial symptom was right hemiparesis predominantly in his lower extremity. Mutism and sympathetic apraxia were also observed. About three months after the onset, he showed psychical excitement due to his curious experience of seeing dogs and snakes in the window and ceiling of his hospital room. A famous professional golf player was also seen. This hallucination lasted about three weeks and never occurred afterwards. Case 2 was a 70 year old housewife who was noticed abnormal by her family because of her mutism of sudden onset. Clumsiness of her extremities was also seen. She had nothing to do with a drug abuse and psychoses. Three days after the onset her mutism turned into talkativeness. She complained of seeing dead persons, who were hanging and coming from the ceiling of her room. Animals and familiar landscapes were also seen. This hallucination lasted about a week. In both cases hallucinations were vivid and colorful. Patients were basically critical for the phenomena although they were initially influenced and excited by them. Temporal and occipital lobes have been thought to bo responsible for the occurrence of organic hallucinations in supratentorial lesions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "content": "The ventral pancreatic bud develops into the pancreatic head and uncinate process. Associated Disorders In pancreas divisum the ducts of the pancreas are not fused to form a full pancreas, but instead it remains as a distinct dorsal and ventral duct. Without the proper fusion of both ducts the majority of the pancreas drainage is mainly through the accessory papilla. Three different variations in pancreas divisum have been described: the first is the classic example of pancreas divisum in which the ventral duct is visualized but there is total failure of fusion; the second variation is with the absence of a ventral duct; and the third variation is when there is very basic communication between the two ducts.

The pancreas develops from these buds on either side of the duodenum. The ventral bud rotates to lie next to the dorsal bud, eventually fusing. In about 10% of adults, an accessory pancreatic duct may be present if the main duct of the dorsal bud of the pancreas does not regress; this duct opens into the minor duodenal papilla. If the two buds themselves, each having a duct, do not fuse, a pancreas may exist with two separate ducts, a condition known as a pancreas divisum. This condition has no physiologic consequence. If the ventral bud does not fully rotate, an annular pancreas may exist, where part or all of the duodenum is encircled by the pancreas. This may be associated with duodenal atresia.
