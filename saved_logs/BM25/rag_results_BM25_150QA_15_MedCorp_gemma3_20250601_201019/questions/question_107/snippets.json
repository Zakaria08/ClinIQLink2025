In the present studies, 4.5 mumole trans,trans-muconaldehyde was reacted with 14C-2'deoxyguanosine 5'-phosphate in phosphate buffer. Products were separated by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Absorbance was monitored using a diode array detector, and aliquots of the HPLC eluant were collected for UV spectrophotometric analysis and scintillation counting. Under these conditions, deoxyguanosine 5'-phosphate eluted at 12.5 min and muconaldehyde at 22.0 min. The HPLC and radioactivity profiles of the muconaldehyde/deoxyguanosine reaction mixture indicated the presence of multiple adducts. Three adducts were detected eluting at 36, 39, and 42 min, which represented approximately 2.5, 2.5, and 1% of the radioactivity, respectively. These adducts had similar UV spectra with absorption maxima between 334 and 347 nm. Another product of the reaction mixture, eluting at 19.0 min and accounting for 10% of the radioactivity, was also observed. This compound had absorption maxima at 348 and 372 nm. These results suggest that trans,trans-muconaldehyde can react with deoxyguanosine monophosphate in vitro under physiological conditions to form stable adducts. Studies are being conducted to determine the structure of these adducts and whether these adducts are formed by the reaction of DNA with muconaldehyde or metabolically activated benzene.",

        "contents": "High-performance liquid chromatography. Detectors HPLC detectors fall into two main categories: universal or selective. Universal detectors typically measure a bulk property (e.g., refractive index) by measuring a difference of a physical property between the mobile phase and mobile phase with solute while selective detectors measure a solute property (e.g., UV-Vis absorbance) by simply responding to the physical or chemical property of the solute. HPLC most commonly uses a UV-Vis absorbance detector, however, a wide range of other chromatography detectors can be used. A universal detector that complements UV-Vis absorbance detection is the Charged aerosol detector (CAD). A kind of commonly utilized detector includes refractive index detectors, which provide readings by measuring the changes in the refractive index of the eluant as it moves through the flow cell. In certain cases, it is possible to use multiple detectors, for example LCMS normally combines UV-Vis with a mass spectrometer.",
