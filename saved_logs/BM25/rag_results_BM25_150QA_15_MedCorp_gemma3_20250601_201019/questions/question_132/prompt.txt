Document 1 (Title: Heinrich Pette Institute): Research The aim of the research at the HPI is to develop new approaches for improved diagnostic techniques and therapies for viral diseases and virus-associated tumor diseases. Scholars of the institute explore a wide range of viruses, such as hepatitis viruses (HPV, HCV), herpes viruses (herpes simplex type 1, herpes simplex type 2, Epstein-Barr virus, and Kaposi's sarcoma herpes virus), leukemia viruses (human T-cell leukemia virus-1, murine leukemia virus), coronaviruses, human immunodeficiency virus and DNA tumor viruses (adenoviruses, SV-40). The drive towards practical applications of the results in diagnosis and treatment is reflected in numerous collaborations with clinical institutions and industry. The institute is divided into six research departments, one independent research unit and two independent junior research group. The institute also has two associated groups. The topics of the current working groups are:
Document 2 (Title: Sexual and reproductive health): Support for contraception is based on views such as reproductive rights, women's rights, and the necessity to prevent child abandonment and child poverty. The World Health Organization states that "By preventing unintended pregnancy, family planning /contraception prevents deaths of mothers and children". Sexually transmitted infection A sexually transmitted infection (STI) --previously known as a sexually transmitted disease (STD) or venereal disease (VD)-- is an infection that has a significant likelihood of transmission between humans by means of sexual activity. The CDC analyses the eight most common STIs: chlamydia, gonorrhea, hepatitis B virus (HBV), herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), human papillomavirus (HPV), syphilis, and trichomoniasis.
Document 3 (Title: Herpes virus): Herpes virus may refer to: Any member of the large family of DNA viruses known as Herpesviridae Human herpesviruses, nine types of herpesviruses that can cause diseases in humans Herpes simplex virus 1 and 2, responsible for herpes simplex infections Human alphaherpesvirus 3, also called varicella-zoster virus, responsible for chickenpox and shingles Human gammaherpesvirus 4, or Epstein–Barr virus, one of the most common viruses which can cause various diseases Human betaherpesvirus 5 Roseolovirus, a genus that includes three human herpesviruses: Human herpesvirus 6, the collective name for Human betaherpesvirus 6A and Human betaherpesvirus 6B Human betaherpesvirus 7 Human gammaherpesvirus 8, or Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus
Document 4 (Title: Herpes simplex virus): Herpes simplex virus 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2), also known by their taxonomical names Human alphaherpesvirus 1 and Human alphaherpesvirus 2, are two members of the human Herpesviridae family, a set of new viruses that produce viral infections in the majority of humans. Both HSV-1 (which produces most cold sores) and HSV-2 (which produces most genital herpes) are common and contagious. They can be spread when an infected person begins shedding the virus. About 67% of the world population under the age of 50 has HSV-1. In the United States, about 47.8% and 11.9% are believed to have HSV-1 and HSV-2, respectively. Because it can be transmitted through any intimate contact, it is one of the most common sexually transmitted infections.
Document 5 (Title: Transmission (medicine)): Some diseases transmissible by the sexual route include HIV/AIDS, chlamydia, genital warts, gonorrhea, hepatitis B, syphilis, herpes, and trichomoniasis. Oral sexual Sexually transmitted diseases such as HIV and hepatitis B are thought to not normally be transmitted through mouth-to-mouth contact, although it is possible to transmit some STDs between the genitals and the mouth, during oral sex. In the case of HIV this possibility has been established. It is also responsible for the increased incidence of herpes simplex virus 1 (which is usually responsible for oral infections) in genital infections and the increased incidence of the type 2 virus (more common genitally) in oral infections.
