In August 1986, she developed involuntary movement which started in the right hand but subsided spontaneously. In September 1988, she again developed right-sided involuntary movements which started in the right hand but rapidly progressed to involve the whole of the right side. In September 1990, she was admitted to our hospital for investigation of choreiform movements, because her involuntary movements had progressed to involve all four extremities. She had no family or past history of chorea, psychiatric, rheumatological or vascular disease. On admission, she had difficulty in speaking and swallowing due to choreiform movements of her mouth and tongue. Her gait was unsteady. On walking she had wild gyrations of the arms. Choreiform movements of all four extremities, neck, face, mouth and tongue were present at rest, more marked on the right side. There was no other neurological deficits. She had none of the classical features of SLE. She had none of the complications commonly associated with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS) (i.e., recurrent spontaneous abortion, thrombosis and thrombocytopenia). Laboratory tests revealed that antinuclear antibody was present. Cardiolipin antibody (VDRL) was positive but specific tests for syphilis were negative. Anticardiolipin antibodies were present. All coagulation studies have failed to reveal lupus anticoagulant. Brain CT, MRI, 123IMP-SPECT and cerebral angiography were normal. Associated with her chorea, she had the serological but not the clinical features of APS. We suggest that antiphospholipid antibodies should be looked for in all unexplained cases of chorea, even when the associated clinical signs of APS are absent.",

        "content": "Serial brain CT and 123I-IMP SPECT were examined in a case with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). A 61-year-old woman had the onset of progressive dementia and gait disturbance in December 1988.

In February 1989, myoclonic movements appeared in several parts of the body and EEG revealed periodic synchronous discharges. Myoclonus was observed most frequently from March to May 1989, and then reduced gradually. She died in June 1990, and the total clinical course was 19 months. Brain atrophy on CT started from about 4 months after the onset, and progressed subacutely. At the end stage of the disease, diffuse brain atrophy including the cerebellum and the brain stem on CT was observed. SPECT revealed decreased perfusion in the cerebral cortex from 5 months after the onset to the end stage, but; perfusion in the cerebellum and the basal ganglia was relatively kept even at the end stage of the disease.

She had no muscle weakness or hypotonia up to 2 years of age when she received mumps vaccination. Three days after the injection, she was first noticed to have limb muscle weakness. The muscle weakness progressed rapidly with increasing difficulty in gait and raising the upper arms, particularly the left. Four months later, she had difficulty in keeping her head up and could no longer climb the stairs. On physical examination, she had proximal dominant generalized muscle weakness, with a preferential neck muscle involvement. She walked waddlingly and stood up with Gowers' maneuver. Facial and ocular muscles were intact. No dysarthria, dysphagia or respiratory difficulty was noted. EMG showed myopathic pattern. Serum creatine kinase level was moderately elevated to 739 IU/l. In the biopsied left biceps muscle, there was marked variation in fiber size, but no apparent necrotic or regenerating fibers. The most striking feature was the presence of numerous eosinophilic inclusions which reduced nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) and were, therefore, stained dark with menadione-linked alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase even without the substrate of menadione, showing the histochemical characteristics of \"reducing\" body. The bodies were predominantly seen in fibers with disorganized intermyofibrillar networks and with high acid phosphatase activity. On electron microscopy, the reducing bodies consisted of fine granular material with the similar electron density to the chromatin granules and were located mostly around the degenerated nuclei, suggesting the nuclear degeneration playing a role in forming the reducing bodies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "content": "We reported a case of intracranial primary malignant lymphoma following Behçet disease treated with colchicine. A 43-year-old female with a past history of oral ulcer and folliculitis visited the Department of Ophthalmology on December, 1990, because of her impaired visual acuity. A diagnosis of uveitis due to incomplete type Behçet disease was made from funduscopic examination and her past history. She had been received 1.0mg/day colchicine for six months in the outpatient clinic. She was referred to our department on August 19, 1991, with nausea and headache. On admission, neurological examination revealed slight right cerebellar ataxia showing dysmetria and dysdiadochokinesis. Computed tomography scan and magnetic resonance images demonstrated a malignant lymphoma in the left cerebellar hemisphere. Stereotaxic biopsy resulted in the B cell type malignant lymphoma (Diffuse large cell type). Galliumscintigraphy, physical examination and peripheral blood examination disclosed no systemic abnormalities. There was a reduction of lymphocyte's response to PHA (phytohemagglutinin) stimulation (1.24). The tuberculin reaction was negative. Colchicine was discontinued and the therapy with radiation and prednisolone (20 mg/day) was started under the diagnosis of intracranial primary malignant lymphoma. She was discharged without any neurological deficits on November 25, 1991. She still suffers from impaired visual acuity, but has no problems in daily life. To our knowledge no intracranial primary malignant lymphoma following Behçet disease has been reported previously. The relationship between Behçet disease treated with colchicine and the occurrence of malignant lymphoma is discussed. In our case we speculated that malignant lymphoma might have occurred in an immunosuppressive state due to administration colchicine.",

        "title": "[A case of idiopathic hypoparathyroidism with extrapyramidal signs and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus].",
        "content": "A case of a 29-year-old woman with idiopathic hypoparathyroidism was reported. There were neither endocrine nor neurological disorders among her family, except for her mother's hearing loss. She had been suffering from insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus since 21 years of age, and was noticed to be hard of hearing for several years, but never been examined. At the age of 27, choreic movement on her left upper limb and gait disturbance appeared. A year before admission, gait disturbance gradually developed and she could not walk any more. On admission, her height was 137.2 cm and her weight 36.5 kg. She had a round face, uneven teeth and borderline metacarpal sign on her right hand. On neurological examination, Parkinsonism, bucco-lingo-masticatory dyskinesia and bilateral extensor planter reflex were present, but tetany was not observed anywhere. Serum calcium was 3.9 mEq/l, and serum phosphorus 5.3 mEq/l. A CT scan of brain revealed calcifications in the bilateral basal ganglia and thalami, low density area in the left putamen, and atrophy of both caudate nuclei. Serum PTH was less than 100 pg/ml. Ellsworth-Howard's test showed hyperresponsiveness in the secretion of urinary phosphorus and cyclic-AMP. Other endocrinological studies showed no abnormality except for hyporesponsiveness in the secretion of insulin on glucose tolerance test. On the basis of these results, a diagnosis of idiopathic hypoparathyroidism with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus was made. Administration of alfacalcidol returned serum calcium and phosphorus to normal with considerable clinical benefit. Parkinsonism was gradually improved and she became to be able to walk with a cane after one year of treatment. But buco-lingo-masticatory dyskinesia were not reduced.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
