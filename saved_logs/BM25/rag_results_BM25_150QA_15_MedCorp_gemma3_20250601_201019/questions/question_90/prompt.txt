Document 1 (Title: Sirtex): Results from the largest most comprehensive study to date evaluating SIRT in liver metastases from colorectal cancer were presented at ASCO in 2012, ASCO-GI 2013 and ASCO in 2014. The various subsets of the MORE study, led by Andrew S. Kennedy M.D. Physician in Chief, Radiation Oncology Sarah Cannon Research Institute Nashville Tenn., have demonstrated safety and efficacy as well as the same in treating the elderly. The most recent set of data presented at ASCO in 2014 documented the ability to predict success of SIRT using standard laboratory tests prior to treatment. In addition, the global SIRFLOX study which completed patient recruitment in 2013 will evaluate SIR-Spheres microspheres a first-line treatment for colorectal liver metastases.
Document 2 (Title: C-C chemokine receptor type 6): Clinical significance CCR6 has a function in development and metastatic spread of gastrointestinal malignancies. Expression of CCR6 was found to be up-regulated in colorectal cancer. Many patients with colorectal cancer have liver metastases. Colorectal carcinoma cells express CCR6 and CCL20. High level of CCL20 in liver chemoattract colorectal carcinoma cells and cause metastases in liver. Novel research has identified a microRNA that is able to downregulate CCR6 in cancer cell lines. CCR6 has been associated with Crohn's disease. References External links Further reading Chemokine receptors Clusters of differentiation
Document 3 (Title: Colorectal cancer): If there are only a few metastases in the liver or lungs, these may also be removed. Chemotherapy may be used before surgery to shrink the cancer before attempting to remove it. The two most common sites of recurrence of colorectal cancer are the liver and lungs. For peritoneal carcinomatosis cytoreductive surgery, sometimes in combination with HIPEC can be used in an attempt to remove the cancer. Chemotherapy In both cancer of the colon and rectum, chemotherapy may be used in addition to surgery in certain cases. The decision to add chemotherapy in management of colon and rectal cancer depends on the stage of the disease.
Document 4 (Title: Sirtex): Metastatic colorectal cancer Colorectal cancer (CRC), also called colon cancer or large bowel cancer, is the third leading cause of cancer-related death in the western world. An estimated 1.6 million people are diagnosed with the disease worldwide every year. An estimated 50% of CRC patients will show liver metastases. It is this form of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) Sirtex targets with SIR-Spheres microspheres. It has been estimated that in 30-40% of patients with advanced disease, the liver is the only site of spread.
Document 5 (Title: Hepatic arterial infusion): Hepatic Arterial Infusion (HAI) is a medical procedure that delivers chemotherapy directly to the liver. The procedure, mostly used in combination with systemic chemotherapy, plays a role in the treatment of liver metastases in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). Although surgical resection remains the standard of care for these liver metastases, majority of patients have lesions that are unresectable. The liver derives its blood supply from two sources – via the hepatic arterial circulation and the portal circulation. Liver metastases get most of their blood supply primarily from the hepatic artery, whereas the normal liver cells get their blood supply from the portal circulation. This allows for chemotherapeutic drugs to be delivered directly to the cancer cells if infused into the hepatic artery.
