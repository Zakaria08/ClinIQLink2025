Document 1 (Title: When a solution is not a solution: Medicaid and Health Maintenance Organizations.): Health Maintenance Organization (HMOs) are repeatedly described as a general solution to the health care crisis and a specific solution to the problems confronting Medicare and Medicaid. The potential incorporation of HMOs into Medicaid has promised to improve the states' ability to accurately budget program expenditures, simplify management, eliminate abusive practices directly linked to fee-for-service (e.g., billing for undelivered services for providing unnecessary care) and, most important, contain costs. At the same time it has promised to increase access to mainstream medicine. Experience has shown, however, that the promise has often been severely compromised by unethical HMO marketing practices, inadequacy of services and excessive administrative costs. This article examines some of the reasons: the political process which created HMOs, the rhetorical claims which exaggerated the strengths of prepaid group practice and distorted the formulation of policy, and the peculiar characteristics of the Medic...
Document 2 (Title: Comparing the medical utilization and expenditures of low income health plan enrollees with Medicaid recipients and with low income enrollees having Medicaid eligibility.): The study examines the medical care (hospital, physician, drug, diagnostic) utilization and expenditures of low income persons enrolled in a prepaid health plan with a matched group of Medicaid recipients. The study also examines the medical care utilization of low income persons enrolled in a prepaid health plan with a similar group of low income persons enrolled in the health plan but also eligible for Medicaid benefits. Utilization and population-at-risk data were obtained from the Kaiser-Permanente Medical Care Program of Portland, Oregon and from the State of Oregon Welfare Division. A hypothesis of lower hospital utilization by low income enrollees compared with Medicaid recipients was accepted. A hypothesis of higher ambulatory care utilization was accepted for diagnostic procedures and prescription use, but rejected for office visit utilization. An analysis of the findings appeared to implicate the Medicaid program for differences observed. The hypotheses of no significant differences in inpatient and...
Document 3 (Title: Access to office-based physicians under capitation reimbursement and Medicaid case management. Findings from the Children's Medicaid Program.): This study reports the effects of a voluntary Medicaid case-management demonstration on the primary care provided to young children by office-based physicians. The MDs who participated were reimbursed at rates higher than the regular Medicaid fee schedule, either through augmented fees for specific services or through monthly capitation payments. Using the Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS) claims data, we compared the rates at which children in the experimental program and children in the regular Medicaid program were seen by a physician during a one-year period. The majority of experimental children received regular and frequent care from primary care physicians during the demonstration. After controlling for race and prior utilization differences, we found that augmented fee-for-service children received more primary care from office-based physicians than children in the regular Medicaid program. Capitation children received at least the same amount of primary care as children in the regular Med...
Document 4 (Title: Case management (US healthcare system)): Case management focuses on delivering personalized services to patients to improve their care, and involves four steps: Referral of new patients (perhaps from another service if the client has relocated to a new area out of previous jurisdiction, or if client no longer meets the target of previous service, such as requiring a greater level of care. Alternatively, they may be referred after having been placed on an ITO or in an inpatient unit. Planning & delivery of care Evaluation of results for each patient & adjustment of the care plan Evaluation of overall program effectiveness & adjustment of the program In the context of a health insurer or health plan it is defined as: Specific types of case management programs include catastrophic or large claim management programs, maternity case management programs, and transitional care management programs. Functions Health insurer and HMO Case managers working for health insurers and HMOs typically do the following:
Document 5 (Title: Quality assurance and utilization review in a health insuring organization. The HealthPASS example.): HealthPASS is a Philadelphia-based health insurance organization (HIO), owned and operated by the Penn Health Corporation, a subsidiary of Maxicare, the large for-profit health maintenance organization (HMO) company based in California. In a contractual agreement with the Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare (DPW), Maxicare contracts primary care physician services on a capitated basis, and other services on a fee basis, to about 96,000 Medicaid enrollees in certain zip codes in Philadelphia. Although HealthPASS does not provide care directly, it contracts with providers for these medical services. HealthPASS serves a primarily poor, minority, and inner city population with high rates of drug abuse, alcoholism, and mental illness. Currently, the enrollees are served by a network of providers including more than 40 participating hospitals and over 500 primary care providers (PCPs) in the community. HealthPASS is unique as previous HIOs in Kentucky and Arizona both failed. This paper describes the quality ...
