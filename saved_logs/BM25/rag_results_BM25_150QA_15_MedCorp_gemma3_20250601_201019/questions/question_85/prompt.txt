Document 1 (Title: Pap test): More frequent Pap smears may be needed to follow up after an abnormal Pap smear, after treatment for abnormal Pap or biopsy results, or after treatment of cancer ( cervical, colon, etc ). Effectiveness The Pap test, when combined with a regular program of screening and appropriate follow-up, can reduce cervical cancer deaths by up to 80%. Failure of prevention of cancer by the Pap test can occur for many reasons, including not getting regular screening, lack of appropriate follow-up of abnormal results, and sampling and interpretation errors. In the US, over half of all invasive cancers occur in females who have never had a Pap smear; an additional 10 to 20% of cancers occur in those who have not had a Pap smear in the preceding five years. About one-quarter of US cervical cancers were in people who had an abnormal Pap smear but did not get appropriate follow-up (patient did not return for care, or clinician did not perform recommended tests or treatment).
Document 2 (Title: Georgios Papanikolaou): In 1928, Papanikolaou told an incredulous audience of physicians about the noninvasive technique of gathering cellular debris from the lining of the vaginal tract and smearing it on a glass slide for microscopic examination as a way to identify cervical cancer. That year, he had undertaken a study of vaginal fluid in women, in hopes of observing cellular changes over the course of a menstrual cycle. In female guinea pigs, Papanicolaou had already noticed cell transformation and wanted to corroborate the phenomenon in human females. It happened that one of Papanicolaou's human subjects was suffering from uterine cancer. Upon examination of a slide made from a smear of the patient's vaginal fluid, Papanicolaou discovered that abnormal cancer cells could be plainly observed under a microscope. "The first observation of cancer cells in the smear of the uterine cervix," he later wrote, "gave me one of the greatest thrills I ever experienced during my scientific career."
Document 3 (Title: Pap test): The Papanicolaou test (abbreviated as Pap test, also known as Pap smear (AE), cervical smear (BE), cervical screening (BE), or smear test (BE)) is a method of cervical screening used to detect potentially precancerous and cancerous processes in the cervix (opening of the uterus or womb) or colon (in both men and women). Abnormal findings are often followed up by more sensitive diagnostic procedures and, if warranted, interventions that aim to prevent progression to cervical cancer. The test was independently invented in the 1920s by Georgios Papanikolaou and Aurel Babeș and named after Papanikolaou. A simplified version of the test was introduced by Anna Marion Hilliard in 1957.
Document 4 (Title: Peutz–Jeghers syndrome): A 2011 Dutch study followed 133 patients for 14 years. The cumulative risk for cancer was 40% and 76% at ages 40 and 70, respectively. 42 (32%) of the patients died during the study, of which 28 (67%) were cancer related. They died at a median age of 45. Mortality was increased compared with the general population. A family with sinonasal polyposis were followed up for 28 years. Two cases of sinonasal type adenocarcinoma developed. This is a rare cancer. This report suggested that follow up of sinus polyps in this syndrome may be indicated. Monitoring Some suggestions for surveillance for cancer include the following: Small intestine with small bowel radiography every 2 years, Esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy every 2 years, CT scan or MRI of the pancreas yearly, Ultrasound of the pelvis and testes yearly Mammography from age 25 annually Papanicolaou smear (Pap smear) annually beginning at age 18-20
Document 5 (Title: Clinical significance of hyperkeratosis on otherwise normal Papanicolaou smears.): Although hyperkeratosis is a common cytological finding on Papanicolaou smear, its clinical significance is unclear. A profile of patients with hyperkeratosis was constructed by comparing them to an age-matched control population having normal Papanicolaou smears. The clinical significance of hyperkeratosis was evaluated and appropriate follow-up studies were recommended. Of 2198 Papanicolaou smears done in the University of Kansas Family Practice Department between October 1, 1988, and October 31, 1989, there were 184 diagnoses of hyperkeratosis from smears on which no other pathological findings were noted. Charts of 183 of these patients with hyperkeratosis were reviewed and compared with an age-matched control population having normal Papanicolaou smears. Patients with hyperkeratosis had a statistically higher incidence of infections with Gardnerella vaginalis, but a lower incidence of infections with Chlamydia trachomatis. Diaphragm use was more prevalent in the group with hyperkeratosis. The incidence o...
