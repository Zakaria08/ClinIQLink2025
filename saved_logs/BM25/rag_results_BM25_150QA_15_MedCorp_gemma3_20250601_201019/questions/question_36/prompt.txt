Document 1 (Title: [Detection of immune complexes in the sera and around the muscle fibers in a case of myasthenia gravis and polymyositis].): A case of myasthenia gravis accompanied with polymyositis and malignant thymoma, detected immune complexes in the sera and around the muscle fibers, was described. A 37-year-old woman was admitted to Shinshu University Hospital in September, 1987 because of dyspnea, dysphagia and muscle weakness. She first noticed her right blepharoptosis 3 weeks before admission. Weakness of all four limbs and myalgia of lower extremities were noticed one week later. These symptoms got worse and nocturnal dyspnea, dysphagia and easy fatigability at mastication appeared. On admission, she looked ill and neurological examination revealed left blepharoptosis, bilateral facial weakness, weakness of all four limbs, more prominent in proximal muscles and tenderness of lower extremities. Edrophonium test was positive, improving her muscle weakness. Laboratory examination revealed the elevated serum levels of CK, the increased titre of circulating immune complexes and high titres of acetylcholine receptor antibodies and anti-skeleta...
Document 2 (Title: [Motor neuron disease with Parkinson's disease--case report].): The patient was a 64-year-old woman who showed muscle weakness and tremor of upper extremities and gait disturbance at the age of 62 years. The symptoms progressed and she was admitted to our hospital. Neurological examination revealed muscle weakness, muscle atrophy and fasciculation bilaterally in the upper extremities. The deep tendon reflexes were reduced in the upper extremities and increased in the lower extremities, but Babinski's sign was not present. There was mild hand tremor at rest (right greater than left). Muscle rigidity was also evident. Her gait was small-stepped and her trunk was bent forward. She showed hypomimia, but no dementia was detected. She died of respiratory failure 7 months after admission. The duration of the illness was about 2 years. At autopsy, macroscopic examination showed depigmentation of the substantia nigra and locus ceruleus, and atrophy of the anterior roots of the spinal cord. Microscopic examination revealed a few senile plaques in the temporal cortex. In the substan...
Document 3 (Title: Lambert–Eaton myasthenic syndrome): Signs and symptoms The weakness from LEMS typically involves the muscles of the proximal arms and legs (the muscles closer to the trunk). In contrast to myasthenia gravis, the weakness affects the legs more than the arms. This leads to difficulties climbing stairs and rising from a sitting position. Weakness is often relieved temporarily after exertion or physical exercise. High temperatures can worsen the symptoms. Weakness of the bulbar muscles (muscles of the mouth and throat) is occasionally encountered. Weakness of the eye muscles is uncommon. Some may have double vision, drooping of the eyelids and difficulty swallowing, but generally only together with leg weakness; this too distinguishes LEMS from myasthenia gravis, in which eye signs are much more common. In the advanced stages of the disease, weakness of the respiratory muscles may occur. Some may also experience problems with coordination (ataxia).
Document 4 (Title: [A case of myasthenia gravis occurring in the period of remission of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy].): A 31-year-old woman noticed progressive muscular weakness in the limbs and paresthesia in the fingers in February 1989. Paresthesia worsened and improved 4 times during 2 months. Intravenous edrophonium chloride failed to improve her muscular weakness. She had high antiacetylcholine receptor antibody titer in serum. We made a diagnosis of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) because of slow nerve conduction velocity (NCV), increased CSF protein, and the clinical course. Treatment with prednisolone improved muscular weakness and the slow NCV. Two years later she acutely had dyspnea, dysphagia, and muscular weakness after upper respiratory infection. Intravenous edrophonium chloride dramatically improved her symptoms. The diagnosis was made as myasthenia gravis (MG). After thymectomy her weakness was getting better without any medications. There may exist an autoimmune mechanism common, at least in part, to both CIDP and MG in our patient.
Document 5 (Title: [Reducing body myopathy--a case report].): A 2-year-old girl with reducing body myopathy was reported. She had no family history of neuromuscular disease. She developed normally with no delay in milestones during infancy. She had no muscle weakness or hypotonia up to 2 years of age when she received mumps vaccination. Three days after the injection, she was first noticed to have limb muscle weakness. The muscle weakness progressed rapidly with increasing difficulty in gait and raising the upper arms, particularly the left. Four months later, she had difficulty in keeping her head up and could no longer climb the stairs. On physical examination, she had proximal dominant generalized muscle weakness, with a preferential neck muscle involvement. She walked waddlingly and stood up with Gowers' maneuver. Facial and ocular muscles were intact. No dysarthria, dysphagia or respiratory difficulty was noted. EMG showed myopathic pattern. Serum creatine kinase level was moderately elevated to 739 IU/l. In the biopsied left biceps muscle, there was marked variati...

Question: A 35-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 1-month history of double vision, difficulty climbing stairs, and weakness when trying to brush her hair. She reports that these symptoms are worse after she exercises and disappear after she rests for a few hours. Physical examination shows drooping of her right upper eyelid that worsens when the patient is asked to gaze at the ceiling for 2 minutes. There is diminished motor strength in the upper extremities. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options:
A. Myasthenia gravis
B. Polymyositis
C. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
D. Multiple sclerosis
