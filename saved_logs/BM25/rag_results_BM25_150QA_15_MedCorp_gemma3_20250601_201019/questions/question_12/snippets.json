        "content": "The mute or nearly mute patient who is alert and has good understanding of speech and a right hemiparesis could have Broca's aphasia, akinesia of speech (transcortical motor aphasia), or aphemia. The patient who has Broca's aphasia does not write well, and his speech does not improve greatly with repetition. The speech of a patient with akinesia of speech improves with repetition. The aphemic patient writes normally, but his speech does not improve with repetition. The mute patient whose eyes are open but who is poorly responsive and moves little or not at all could be an akinetic mute (with either a cingulate or a thalamomesencephalic lesion) or have a locked-in syndrome. The latter is diagnosed by asking the patient to look up and down or to open and close his eyes. If he obeys these commands, the physician questions him using a code of eye movement responses. If the patient fails to respond at all, he is an akinetic mute; intense stimulation may result in speech or movement. If the patient is drowsy and has third nerve involvement, the lesion is in the thalamomesencephalic reticular formation. If the patient appears alert and has episodes of agitation, he probably has bilateral lesions in the gyri cinguli. Patients with weakness of the bulbar musculature (facial, palatal, and tongue weakness and dysphonia) may have either upper motor neuron or lower motor neuron lesions. Only bilateral upper motor neuron lesions produce permanent dysarthria. As a typical example, a patient has a transient left hemiparesis with dysarthria and almost completely recovers. Later, however, a right hemiparesis develops and the patient experiences severe bilateral facial weakness, drooling, dysphagia, and severe dysarthria. The absence of atrophy of the bulbar musculature, a hyperactive jaw jerk and gag reflex and, sometimes, inappropriate laughing or crying episodes indicate that the lesion is located above the medulla in the corticobulbar tracts. Flaccid paralysis, absence of the jaw jerk or gag reflex, and absence of other upper motor neuron signs, such as upgoing toes, indicate a lower motor neuron or neuromuscular junction problem. Appropriate tests to rule out myasthenia gravis should be done. The other conditions discussed here are often obvious from their clinical presentation. Although the specific disorder of speech sometimes is helpful in localizing the cause, in most patients, the associated deficits on neurologic examination are of greatest value.",

This rare disease can be marked by a unique triad of symptoms: proximal muscle weakness, autonomic dysfunction, and areflexia. Proximal muscle weakness is a product of pathogenic autoantibodies directed against P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channels, which in turn leads to a reduction of acetylcholine release from motor nerve terminals on the presynaptic cell. Examples of autonomic dysfunction caused by LEMS include erectile dysfunction in men, constipation, and, most commonly, dry mouth. Less common dysfunctions include dry eyes and altered perspiration. Areflexia is a condition in which tendon reflexes are reduced and it may subside temporarily after a period of exercise.",

A 46-year-old man was admitted to Shinshu University Hospital on June 2, 1989, with the chief complaint of muscle weakness and pain. He had a 1.5-year history of frequent episodes of Raynaud's phenomenon. Five months before presentation, he noticed muscle weakness and pain in the proximal muscles of his extremities. One month after the onset of these symptoms, his body temperature increased to 38 degrees C and remained elevated until the following month. He subsequently entered a local hospital. He was found to have diminished strength in all limbs that was more marked in the proximal areas. The muscle weakness and pain progressed until the patient was no longer able to walk. Muscle biopsy of the left quadriceps femoris showed mononuclear cell infiltration in the endomyosium that was accompanied by phagocytosis and interstitial fibrosis. Based on these findings, a diagnosis of polymyositis was made. During hospitalization, the weakness continued to worsen despite pulse therapy with methylprednisolone 1000 mg per day for 3 days and the administration of prednisolone 100 mg and azathioprine 100 mg per day. The patient was transferred to our hospital for further evaluation and treatment. On physical examination, he demonstrated hair loss, soft palate aphthae, tonsillar injection, and cervical lymphadenopathy. Neurological examination revealed generalized weakness; the patient was barely able to move all of his limbs.

His thymoma was found in July 1988, and in October 1988, he was admitted to our hospital for treatment. Neurological examination showed muscular weakness, muscular atrophy, fasciculation, and distal dominant sensory disturbance of his right upper extremity and his bilateral lower extremities. The immunological examination showed an increase in serum IgG, gamma-globulin, OKT3 and OKT4 lymphocytes. Electromyographic studies showed severe waxing by repeated stimulations (200% by 10 Hz; 330% by 20 Hz), very low M wave amplitude by single stimulation, and post-tetanic exhaustion. An Eaton-Lambert-type neuromuscular transmission block was thus thought to exist. Concentric needle electromyography showed a neurogenic pattern. The sensory and motor nerve conduction velocity was delayed. Microscopic examination of biopsied skeletal muscle showed neurogenic change. A sural nerve biopsy specimen showed a decrease in the number of myelinated fibers (fiber density 4333/mm2), segmental demyelination, remyelination, and mild axonal change. Thymectomy was performed and pathological examination showed invasive thymoma of predominantly the epithelial type. His muscular weakness and sensory disturbance improved gradually after thymectomy. On the postoperative immunological examination, serum IgG, gamma-globulin, OKT3 and OKT4 lymphocytes were normalized. On the other hand, OKT8 lymphocytes were increased and the OKT4 to OKT8 ratio was decreased. The electromyographic studies showed no waxing, normal M wave amplitude, and no post-tetanic exhaustion.

In 1988 weakness of left elbow flexion appeared and he was admitted to our hospital. On examination, he had weakness and atrophy of both upper extremities. Fasciculation was noticed in the proximal part of right arm. When his head was bent forward, dysesthesia appeared around radial side of his arm. There were no long tract sign or objective sensory loss. EMG showed neurogenic change over both his upper extremities. In plain cervical roentgenogram there existed abnormal kyphosis of cervical vertebrae. In MRI imaged with his neck flexed, cervical cord was compressed by the posterior surface of 4th cervical vertebral body, which corresponded to the top of cervical kyphosis. Based on these signs and examinations, a diagnosis of flexion myelopathy was made. Spinal immobilization by wiring and bone graft implantation ranging from C2 to C6 was performed to limit the range of anterior nuchal flexion. After this operation, improvement of muscle strength along with the disappearance of dysesthesia on neck flexion was observed. Clinically, this case closely resembles to juvenile type of distal and segmental muscular atrophy of upper extremities (Hirayama type). From our study, pathomechanism of this case seems to be a flexion myelopathy at C4 level. This view is supported also by the good recovery after the operation.

At the age of 54, he was admitted to our hospital when neurological findings revealed marked amyotrophy of general skeletal muscle and tongue with fasciculation. Deep tendon reflexes were decreased. Cerebellar ataxia was impossible to evaluate because of profound muscle weakness. And sensory disturbance was suspected in the distal portion of the lower extremities. CT scan revealed progressive atrophy of the brain stem and cerebellum. The patient died at the age of 54 due to CO2 narcosis. The clinical course was 8 years. A summary of the pathological findings was as follows: 1) Marked neuronal loss of the anterior horn of the spinal cord and motor cranial nerve nuclei except for oculomotor nuclei, with mild degeneration of pyramidal tract below lumbosacral level. 2) Degeneration of cerebellipetal system, spinocerebellar tract, Clarke's column and the middle root zone and cerebellifugal system, dentate nucleus, superior cerebellar peduncles, and red nucleus. 3) Mild degeneration of pontine nuclei, inferior olivary nuclei, pontine transverse fibers, the middle and inferior cerebellar peduncles, cerebellar white matter and Purkinje cells as in OPCA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "content": "A case of mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with a partial cytochrome c oxidase deficiency was reported with special reference to electrophysiological studies. A 56-year-old man was readmitted to Himeji Central Hospital due to mental deterioration and character change. At the age of 44 when he was attacked by his first epileptic seizure, he was admitted to Himeji Central Hospital, where EEG abnormalities and cerebral atrophy were found. Anticonvulsants helped to relieve his generalized convulsions but the EEG abnormalities persisted. At age 46, he had the second generalized seizure, so he quit his job as a crane operator. His family began to notice deterioration of his intellectual function and hyperaggressive behavior. His daily activities, intellectual performance and mental condition gradually deteriorated (WAIS FIQ less than 60). Other clinical and laboratory findings are as follows: bilateral impaired hearing, no optic nerve atrophy, no disturbance of extra ocular muscle movements, mild wasting and weakness of his extremities, normal coordination and sensation, no myoclonus or other involuntary movements, normal laboratory data of serum creatinine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase and aldolase, and increased amount of lactate and pyruvate in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), no abnormal amino acids in urine. A biopsy specimen of right biceps brachii muscle revealed numerous ragged-red fibers in frozen sections stained by the Gomori trichrome method. These fibers did not react to a cytochrome c oxidase staining. An ATPase staining demonstrated an atrophy of type-2 fibers. An electron micrograph showed many mitochondria in the sarcoplasm but few paracrystalline inclusions. A biochemical analysis of the muscle biopsy also revealed a significant decrease in the cytochrome c oxidase activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "content": "A 57-year-old man of Kennedy-Alter-Sung syndrome (K-A-S) with type IIa hyperlipidemia was reported with studies of several sex hormone receptors. He noticed tremulous movements of hands on gripping at age 40 and gynecomastia at age 46. He had been pointed out to waddle since 52 years old, and also noticed difficulty in going up stairs and standing up at age 54. He was admitted to our Neurology Service on June 5, 1989. On general physical examinations, gynecomastia, eyelids xanthomas and hypertrophy of Achilles tendons were found. Neurologic examination revealed clear consciousness and slight dysarthric speech with nasal voice. Cranial nerves showed mild bilateral facial weakness, poor uvula and soft palatal movements, atrophy and weakness of bilateral sternocleidomastoid muscles, and atrophy of tongue with fasciculation. The four extremities were hypotonic, and proximal muscular atrophy and weakness of four extremities were seen. Deep tendon reflexes were absent in four extremities and fasciculation on both thighs was noted on contraction. Sensory and cerebellar functions were intact. Waddling gait and Gowers' sign were present. In K-A-S syndrome, abnormal lipid metabolism such as a family of type IIa hyperlipidemia, or familial and sporadic cases of type IV hyperlipidemia has been documented. In the family of our cases, his elder sister was found to have type IIa hyperlipidemia, while his son had type IV hyperlipidemia. The coexistence of these two types of hyperlipidemia in the same family of K-A-S syndrome has not been reported so far to our knowledge.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "content": "An 18-year-old high-school boy presented facial muscle weakness since birth, and then developed wasting around the neck, shoulder girdle, upper arms, and thighs. He was born to un-consanguineous parents. His father had suffered from similar but milder muscle atrophy with predominance on the right side of the face and shoulder girdle since adolescence. His mother and his only sibling were clinically unaffected. Hearing disturbance was detected at the age of 6, and he also noted atrophy of the tongue and the bilateral thighs at the age of 10. The symptom progressed gradually. Neurological examination on admission revealed a well-developed boy (166 cm/60 kg) with a prominent facial diplegia with distinct proximal muscular atrophy of the extremities. Muscles of the tongue, neck, upper arms, shoulder and pelvic girdles, and hamstrings were markedly involved. The anterior tibial muscles were also affected, while the calf muscles were hypertrophic. High arched palate, X legs, mild lordoscoliosis were also noted. Serum CK was slightly increased (424 IU/l), and needle EMG in the extremities including the tongue revealed myopathic changes. Muscle CT demonstrated marked atrophy of the proximal muscles in the lower limbs and hypertrophy of the calf muscles. Audiogram showed bilateral sensorineural hearing disturbance. Muscle biopsy of the gastrocnemius showed myogenic as well as neurogenic changes consisting of atrophic and hypertrophic fibers with interstitial cellular infiltration, and type I fiber predominance. With these family history as well as clinical and laboratory examinations, this case could be diagnosed as \"congenital facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy\".(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "content": "A 56 year-old man presented with vertigo and the right sided weakness. Neurological examination revealed a lethargic man with good orientation to three spheres. His neck was supple. He had anisocoria, the right pupil being larger than the left by 1.5 mm with sluggish light reaction bilaterally. He had exotropia of the right eye in primary gaze. The abduction of both eyes were full with terminal horizontal nystagmus. The adduction of both eyes were quite limited in each eye. He had a limited upward gaze with poor convergence. These were interpreted as the syndrome of the medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF) bilaterally. He had a depressed gag reflex on the right side with tongue deviation to the right. He had a mild weakness of the right side limb and also had the right sided hemihyperesthesia including his face to pain and temperature. Twenty four hours after the onset, the left brachial angiography revealed a complete occlusion of the rostral portion of the basilar artery without visualization of the posterior cerebral and superior cerebellar arteries bilaterally. CT scans three days after the onset revealed a low density area in the mid pons with extension rostrally up to the mesencephalon. Four days later he became quadriplegic with bilateral horizontal gaze palsy. No more internuclear ophthalmoplegia is noted on both sides. The midline location of the MLF in the pons, and the separate blood supplies by different paramedian branches of the basilar artery, form the anatomical explanation for the frequent unilaterality of vascular and bilaterality of demyelinating lesions. Bilateral MLF syndrome has been considered almost pathognomonic of multiple sclerosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

He experienced left putaminal bleeding following mild right hemiparesis and emotional incontinence without any difficulties in his daily life since three years before admission. On neurological examination the patient was alert and oriented. He showed forced crying. Myerson's sign was positive. There were no abnormal findings in ocular movements, pupillary reflexes and other cranial nerves. Muscle tone was increased with cog-wheel phenomenon in bilateral upper extremities. Coordination was preserved. He showed severe akinesia and small steppage gait with stooped posture. Freezing phenomenon was observed in initiation of gait and turning. The deep tendon reflexes were increased in the right side with bilateral pathological reflexes. There was no definite weakness and sensory disturbance in all extremities. Brain CT revealed a small high density lesion in the medial side of right cerebral peduncle and a lens-shaped low density lesion in the left putamen. On T1 and T2 weighted images of MRI, right peduncular lesion showed low signal. It extended to the substantia nigra which was partially destructed. His parkinsonism was rapidly improved and completely disappeared within following two weeks. High density lesion of right peduncle on CT also disappeared. We discussed the mechanisms of parkinsonism following unilateral mesencephalic hemorrhage in this patient.",
