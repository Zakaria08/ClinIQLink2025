Document 1 (Title: Nonlanguage disorders of speech reflect complex neurologic apparatus.): The mute or nearly mute patient who is alert and has good understanding of speech and a right hemiparesis could have Broca's aphasia, akinesia of speech (transcortical motor aphasia), or aphemia. The patient who has Broca's aphasia does not write well, and his speech does not improve greatly with repetition. The speech of a patient with akinesia of speech improves with repetition. The aphemic patient writes normally, but his speech does not improve with repetition. The mute patient whose eyes are open but who is poorly responsive and moves little or not at all could be an akinetic mute (with either a cingulate or a thalamomesencephalic lesion) or have a locked-in syndrome. The latter is diagnosed by asking the patient to look up and down or to open and close his eyes. If he obeys these commands, the physician questions him using a code of eye movement responses. If the patient fails to respond at all, he is an akinetic mute; intense stimulation may result in speech or movement. If the patient is drowsy and ha...
Document 2 (Title: Neuromuscular junction): Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) is an autoimmune disorder that affects the presynaptic portion of the neuromuscular junction. This rare disease can be marked by a unique triad of symptoms: proximal muscle weakness, autonomic dysfunction, and areflexia. Proximal muscle weakness is a product of pathogenic autoantibodies directed against P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channels, which in turn leads to a reduction of acetylcholine release from motor nerve terminals on the presynaptic cell. Examples of autonomic dysfunction caused by LEMS include erectile dysfunction in men, constipation, and, most commonly, dry mouth. Less common dysfunctions include dry eyes and altered perspiration. Areflexia is a condition in which tendon reflexes are reduced and it may subside temporarily after a period of exercise.
Document 3 (Title: [Chronic demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy associated with malignant histiocytosis].): A case of malignant histiocytosis (MH) presenting with peripheral nerve involvement is described. A 67-year-old man initially noted left facial weakness on July 20, 1986. The symptom was improved within a week, however, two weeks later he noticed numbness in his fingers and a burning pain in his legs, which was followed by double vision and progressive weakness in all four limbs. On examination, he was found to have total ophthalmoparesis of the right eye and a trace of the left facial palsy. There was severe weakness of the leg muscles, as well as mild weakness of the arms. This was accompanied by wasting of his limbs. All tendon reflexes were absent. Planter responses were flexor. Although cutaneous sensation was intact, vibratory sense was markedly impaired in the legs below the knees. The sphincter function was mildly disturbed. The sedimentation rate was 32 mm/hr. The hemoglobin was 11.9 g/dl and the leukocyte count was 5,700/mm3. The platelet count fell to 60,000/mm3. Results of routine biochemical and ...
Document 4 (Title: [Successful treatment of "steroid-immunosuppressant resistant" polymyositis with immunoadsorption].): We report a case of "steroid and immunosuppressant-resistant" polymyositis that was successfully treated with immunoadsorption. A 46-year-old man was admitted to Shinshu University Hospital on June 2, 1989, with the chief complaint of muscle weakness and pain. He had a 1.5-year history of frequent episodes of Raynaud's phenomenon. Five months before presentation, he noticed muscle weakness and pain in the proximal muscles of his extremities. One month after the onset of these symptoms, his body temperature increased to 38 degrees C and remained elevated until the following month. He subsequently entered a local hospital. He was found to have diminished strength in all limbs that was more marked in the proximal areas. The muscle weakness and pain progressed until the patient was no longer able to walk. Muscle biopsy of the left quadriceps femoris showed mononuclear cell infiltration in the endomyosium that was accompanied by phagocytosis and interstitial fibrosis. Based on these findings, a diagnosis of polymy...
Document 5 (Title: [A case of malignant thymoma associated with Eaton-Lambert-type neuromuscular transmission block and sensorimotor neuropathy].): The patient is a 73-year-old male. In January 1988, he noticed sensory disturbance and muscular weakness of his extremities. His thymoma was found in July 1988, and in October 1988, he was admitted to our hospital for treatment. Neurological examination showed muscular weakness, muscular atrophy, fasciculation, and distal dominant sensory disturbance of his right upper extremity and his bilateral lower extremities. The immunological examination showed an increase in serum IgG, gamma-globulin, OKT3 and OKT4 lymphocytes. Electromyographic studies showed severe waxing by repeated stimulations (200% by 10 Hz; 330% by 20 Hz), very low M wave amplitude by single stimulation, and post-tetanic exhaustion. An Eaton-Lambert-type neuromuscular transmission block was thus thought to exist. Concentric needle electromyography showed a neurogenic pattern. The sensory and motor nerve conduction velocity was delayed. Microscopic examination of biopsied skeletal muscle showed neurogenic change. A sural nerve biopsy specimen sh...

Question: A 1-year-old boy presents to the emergency department with weakness and a change in his behavior. His parents state that they first noticed the change in his behavior this morning and it has been getting worse. They noticed the patient was initially weak in his upper body and arms, but now he won’t move his legs with as much strength or vigor as he used to. Physical exam is notable for bilateral ptosis with a sluggish pupillary response, a very weak sucking and gag reflex, and shallow respirations. The patient is currently drooling and his diaper is dry. The parents state he has not had a bowel movement in over 1 day. Which of the following is the pathophysiology of this patient’s condition?
Options:
A. Autoantibodies against the presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels
B. Autoimmune demyelination of peripheral nerves
C. Blockade of presynaptic acetylcholine release at the neuromuscular junction
D. Lower motor neuron destruction in the anterior horn
