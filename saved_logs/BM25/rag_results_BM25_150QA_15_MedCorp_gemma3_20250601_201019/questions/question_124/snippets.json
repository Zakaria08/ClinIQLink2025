The protein encoded by this gene is an apolipoprotein and an important determinant of plasma triglyceride levels, a major risk factor for coronary artery disease. It is a component of several lipoprotein fractions including VLDL, HDL, chylomicrons. It is believed that apoA-V affects lipoprotein metabolism by interacting with LDL-R gene family receptors. Considering its association with lipoprotein levels, APOA5 is implicated in metabolic syndrome. The APOA5 gene also contains one of 27 SNPs associated with increased risk of coronary artery disease.
