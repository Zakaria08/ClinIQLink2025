Document 1 (Title: [MRI findings of brain-stem tuberculoma in a case of tuberculous meningitis].): A 54-year-old woman developed headache and slight fever. When she consulted a physician, she could not move either of her eyes to the right. Cranial CT scan revealed no significant findings. Lumbar puncture was performed and CSF examination showed the cell count of 10,304/mm3, glucose level of 10 mg/dl, and total protein value of 270 mg/dl. Her symptoms and laboratory findings suggested meningitis and she was admitted to our hospital. Neurological examination revealed bilateral dilated pupils with sluggish light reflex, right gaze palsy, and hypesthesia of the left side of her face. A diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis was established by a positive test for acid-fast bacillus in CSF, and anti-tuberculous therapy was started at once. One month after the onset of symptoms, her main complaints were double vision and cerebellar ataxia. Both CT and MRI revealed a right brain-stem lesion. Pre-contrast CT could not clearly visualize the lesion but with contrast medium a homogeneously-enhanced circular lesion was sh...
Document 2 (Title: [Recurrent episodic unilateral mydriasis with pleocytosis in the cerebrospinal fluid--a case report].): A 24-year-old female was admitted to our hospital on Aug. 20 in 1986 because of blurred vision and right pupillary dilatation. She had sometimes noticed headache later than 1976, and blurred vision without headache several times a year later than 1983. She had been told her right pupil dilated when she had complained of blurred vision. Neurological examination revealed abnormal findings as follows; diminished sense of smell in the right side, anisocoria (R 8 mm, L 5 mm), bilateral hippus, hypesthesioalgesia in her right face, left trunk and left arm. The pupils were round and contracted promptly to light. Accommodation reflex and ciliospinal reflexes were normal. Neither blepharoptosis nor external ocular muscle paresis were observed. Deep tendon reflexes were normal. Planter responses were flexor. There was no meningeal irritative sign. No abnormal findings were obtained in blood and urine, chest X-p, brain enhanced CT scan, EEG, and cerebral angiography except for slight degree of anemia. Serum TPHA was neg...
Document 3 (Title: Pseudo-pseudo-Foster Kennedy syndrome.): An 80-year-old woman presented with a classic story and findings of an anterior ischemic optic neuropathy in her left eye. Her right eye had slow and progressive decreased vision, ostensibly secondary to a cataract. However, the right eye showed slight temporal pallor of the optic disc and a superior temporal field defect was found. Her radiologic exam showed a tuberculum sella meningioma extending into the right optic canal compressing the right optic nerve. Two diseases, ischemic optic neuropathy and meningioma, in one patient may be termed a pseudo-pseudo-Foster Kennedy syndrome.
Document 4 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): Introduction to Autonomic Pharmacology Bertram G. Katzung, MD, PhD A 56-year-old woman is brought to the university eye center with a complaint of “loss of vision.” Because of visual impair-ment, she has lost her driver’s license and has fallen several times in her home. Examination reveals that her eyelids close involuntarily with a frequency and duration sufficient to pre-vent her from seeing her surroundings for more than brief moments at a time. When she holds her eyelids open with her fingers, she can see normally. She has no other muscle dysfunction. A diagnosis of blepharospasm is made. Using a fine needle, several injections of botulinum toxin type A are made in the orbicularis oculi muscle of each eyelid. After observation in the waiting area, she is sent home. Two days later, she reports by telephone that her vision has improved dramatically. How did botulinum toxin improve her vision? How long can her vision be expected to remain normal after this single treatment?
Document 5 (Title: [A case of presumed radiation optic neuropathy].): A case of a 37-year-old woman with radiation optic neuropathy was reported. She had undergone subtotal removal of the right orbital tumor (adenoid cystic carcinoma) by frontal craniotomy, followed by radiation therapy (64Gy). She had been quite well until she noticed a gradual loss of vision in her right eye 18 months later. Her visual acuity was 0.2 in the right eye and 1.5 in the left eye with right relative afferent pupillary defect and dense central scotoma. Funduscopy revealed optic disc swelling with surrounding retinal edema and small hemorrhage in the right eye. Fluorescein angiography revealed a hypoperfusion area and obstruction of the small retinal vessels in the posterior pole, but this was not large enough to explain the dense central scotoma. Although prednisolone therapy gave temporary improvement, the visual function gradually deteriorated.

Question: A 63-year-old woman presents to her primary-care doctor for a 2-month history of vision changes, specifically citing the gradual onset of double vision. Her double vision is present all the time and does not get better or worse throughout the day. She has also noticed that she has a hard time keeping her right eye open, and her right eyelid looks 'droopy' in the mirror. Physical exam findings during primary gaze are shown in the photo. Her right pupil is 6 mm and poorly reactive to light. The rest of her neurologic exam is unremarkable. Laboratory studies show an Hb A1c of 5.0%. Which of the following is the next best test for this patient?
Options:
A. Direct fundoscopy
B. Intraocular pressures
C. MR angiography of the head
D. Temporal artery biopsy
