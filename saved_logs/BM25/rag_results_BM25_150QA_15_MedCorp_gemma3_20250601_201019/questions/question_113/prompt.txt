Document 1 (Title: Plasmodium mackerrasae): Plasmodium mackerrasae is a parasite of the genus Plasmodium. Like all Plasmodium species P. mackerrasae has both vertebrate and insect hosts. The vertebrate hosts for this parasite are reptiles. Description The parasite was first described by Telford in 1979. Both schizonts and gametocytes parasitize all cells in the erythrocyte series. The presence of pigment in both asexual and sexual stages is correlated with maturity of the host cell. While asexual forms contain a single large vacuole, the mature gametocytes may show 1-4 vacuoles. The mature schizonts containing 6-12 nuclei arranged peripherally as a rosette. The gametocytes are round to oval and are equal to or slightly smaller than host cell nuclei. This species resembles Plasmodium sasai and Plasmodium tropiduri. It may be distinguished from these species by the following characteristics: P. sasai possess fan-shaped schizonts and its gametocytes are more heavily pigmented
Document 2 (Title: Plasmodium falciparum): P. falciparum does not have a fixed structure but undergoes continuous change during the course of its life cycle. A sporozoite is spindle-shaped and 10–15 μm long. In the liver it grows into an ovoid schizont of 30–70 μm in diameter. Each schizont produces merozoites, each of which is roughly 1.5 μm in length and 1 μm in diameter. In the erythrocyte the merozoite form a ring-like structure, becoming a trophozoite. A trophozoites feed on the haemoglobin and forms a granular pigment called haemozoin. Unlike those of other Plasmodium species, the gametocytes of P. falciparum are elongated and crescent-shaped, by which they are sometimes identified. A mature gametocyte is 8–12 μm long and 3–6 μm wide. The ookinete is also elongated measuring about 18–24 μm. An oocyst is rounded and can grow up to 80 μm in diameter. Microscopic examination of a blood film reveals only early (ring-form) trophozoites and gametocytes that are in the peripheral blood. Mature trophozoites or schizonts in
Document 3 (Title: Plasmodium falciparum): The species originated from the malarial parasite Laverania found in gorillas, around 10,000 years ago. Alphonse Laveran was the first to identify the parasite in 1880, and named it Oscillaria malariae. Ronald Ross discovered its transmission by mosquito in 1897. Giovanni Battista Grassi elucidated the complete transmission from a female anopheline mosquito to humans in 1898. In 1897, William H. Welch created the name Plasmodium falciparum, which ICZN formally adopted in 1954. P. falciparum assumes several different forms during its life cycle. The human-infective stage are sporozoites from the salivary gland of a mosquito. The sporozoites grow and multiply in the liver to become merozoites. These merozoites invade the erythrocytes (RBCs) to form trophozoites, schizonts and gametocytes, during which the symptoms of malaria are produced. In the mosquito, the gametocytes undergo sexual reproduction to a zygote, which turns into ookinete. Ookinete forms oocytes from which sporozoites are
Document 4 (Title: Plasmodium falciparum Malaria -- Etiology): Five species of genus Plasmodium are known to cause malaria in humans. The vector for Plasmodium spp. is a female A nopheles mosquito that inoculates sporozoites contained in her salivary glands into the puncture wound when feeding. [3] Sporozoites enter peripheral bloodstream and are uptaken by hepatocytes, where they undergo an asexual pre-erythrocytic liver-stage as liver schizonts lasting up to 2 weeks before the onset of the blood stage. [3] [4] As they replicate within hepatocytes, they form motile merozoites that are subsequently released into the bloodstream, where they invade red blood cells (RBC). The process continues through serial cycles of asexual replication of merozoites that go through ring, trophozoite, and schizont stages before forming and releasing new invasive daughter merozoites that consequently infect new RBC, therefore causing a rise in parasite numbers. [3] [5] P. falciparum produces high levels of blood-stage parasites and is known to modify the surface of the infected RBC, creatin...
Document 5 (Title: Plasmodium diminutivum): Plasmodium diminutivum is a parasite of the genus Plasmodium subgenus Carinamoeba. Like all Plasmodium species P. diminutivum has both vertebrate and insect hosts. The vertebrate hosts for this parasite are reptiles. Description This species was described by Telford in 1973. The parasites have no apparent effect on the host erythrocyte and tend to lie in a polar or lateral position within the host cell. This species appears to infect only mature cells. The schizonts are initially round to oval but as they mature become fan shaped with a pigment mass forming the handle of the fan. Mature schizonts measure 4.1 +/- 0.2 (range: 3-4) micrometres x 3.1 +/- 0.1 (range: (3-4) micrometres and contain 4-6 merozoites. Mature gametocytes are round to oval and measure 5.6 +/- 0.2 (range: 5-7) micrometres x 4.8 +/- 0.2 (range: 4-6) micrometres. Vacuoles are rarely seen. Geographical occurrence This species occurs in Panama. Clinical features and host pathology
