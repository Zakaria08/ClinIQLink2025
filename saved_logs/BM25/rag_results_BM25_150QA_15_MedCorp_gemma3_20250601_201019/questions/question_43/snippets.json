A 53-year-old man was admitted to Keio University Hospital on June 13, 1988, because of a fever and a headache. On June 3, he suddenly started shivering and his temperature rose to 39 degrees C. He then began to complain of polydipsia, polyuria, and a weight loss of 4 kg a week. On June 11, he developed a severe headache. Four years prior to this incident, he had been diagnosed as having diabetes after a routine medical examination, but had neglected to undergo medical treatment. On admission, laboratory data showed leukocytosis, hyperglycemia (394 mg/dl) and ketonuria (4+). A lumbar puncture yielded cloudy cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) containing 500/3 cells/mm8, of which about 70% were neutrophils. A diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis and purulent meningitis was made. A treatment with ampicillin (ABPC) and CTX, (12 g/day, each) was begun. On the third day, cultures of a blood specimen and CSF yielded both K. pneumoniae. The MICs of CTX to K. pneumoniae isolated from blood and CSF were both 0.05 microgram/ml. ABPC was discontinued, gentamicin was administered for 2 days, CTX was continued at the same dosage level and an administration of prednisolone 40 mg daily was begun.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

As his consciousness was so clear, we applied to him the negative extra-thoracic pressure ventilator which was designed by the authors. Negative extra-thoracic pressure ventilation (NETPV) was maintained at a IMV rate of 30 breath/min, peak negative extra-thoracic pressure of -20 to -30 cmH2O, and an inspiratory/expiratory ratio of 1:2. During NETPV, his respiratory rate and oxygen consumption were decreased and Pao2 was increased compared with his spontaneous breathing. He made a recovery from dyspnea, especially, he was able to take a deep breath. When NETPV was applied to him, pulmonary artery and arterial catheterizations revealed that central venous pressure was slightly decreased, cardiac index unchanged or slightly decreased, heart rate, systemic blood pressure, and pulmonary arterial pressure unchanged compared with spontaneous breathing. The patient was able to read books and maintained communication in his voice with his family and the medical staff. After 3 days of the treatment with NETPV, a marked improvement was noted and the patient was discharged from the ICU. NETPV has the benefits as follows.

Decreased consciousness Significant weakness such that the person is unable to walk Inability to feed Two or more convulsions Low blood pressure (less than 70 mmHg in adults and 50 mmHg in children) Breathing problems Circulatory shock Kidney failure or haemoglobin in the urine Bleeding problems, or hemoglobin less than 50 g/L (5 g/dL) Pulmonary oedema Blood glucose less than 2.2 mmol/L (40 mg/dL) Acidosis or lactate levels of greater than 5 mmol/L A parasite level in the blood of greater than 100,000 per microlitre (μL) in low-intensity transmission areas, or 250,000 per μL in high-intensity transmission areas",

        "content": "Definition Blood sugar levels naturally fluctuate throughout the day, however hypoglycemia, also called low blood sugar or low blood glucose, is when blood sugar levels drop below 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L). Blood sugar levels are generally maintained between 70 and 110 mg/dL (3.9-6.1 mmol/L). Although 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) is the lower limit of normal glucose, symptoms of hypoglycemia usually do not occur until 55 mg/dL (3.0 mmol/L) or lower. The blood glucose level at which symptoms of hypoglycemia develop in someone with several prior episodes of hypoglycemia may be even lower. Whipple's triad The symptoms of low blood sugar alone are not specific enough to characterize a hypoglycemic episode. A single blood sugar reading below 70 mg/dL is also not specific enough characterize a hypoglycemic episode. Whipple's triad is a set of three conditions that need to be met in order to accurately characterize a hypoglycemic episode. The three conditions are the following:",

The diagnostic criteria from the National Diabetes Data Group (NDDG) have been used most often, but some centers rely on the Carpenter and Coustan criteria, which set the cutoff for normal at lower values. Compared with the NDDG criteria, the Carpenter and Coustan criteria lead to a diagnosis of gestational diabetes in 54 percent more pregnant women, with an increased cost and no compelling evidence of improved perinatal outcomes. The following are the values which the American Diabetes Association considers to be abnormal during the 100 g of glucose OGTT: Fasting blood glucose level ≥95 mg/dL (5.33 mmol/L) 1 hour blood glucose level ≥180 mg/dL (10 mmol/L) 2 hour blood glucose level ≥155 mg/dL (8.6 mmol/L) 3 hour blood glucose level ≥140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L)",
