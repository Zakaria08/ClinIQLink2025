Document 1 (Title: Iodothyronine deiodinase): Hypothyroidism is a disease diagnosed by decreased levels of serum thyroxine (T4). Presentation in adults leads to decreased metabolism, increased weight gain, and neuropsychiatric complications. During development, hypothyroidism is considered more severe and leads to neurotoxicity as cretinism or other human cognitive disorders, altered metabolism and underdeveloped organs. Medication and environmental exposures can result in hypothyroidism with changes in deiodinase enzyme activity. The drug iopanoic acid (IOP) decreased cutaneous cell proliferation by inhibition of deiodinase enzyme type 1 or 2 reducing the conversion of T4 to T3. The environmental chemical DE-71, a PBDE pentaBDE brominated flame retardant decreased hepatic deiodinase I transcription and enzyme activity in neonatal rats with hypothyroidism. Quantifying enzyme activity
Document 2 (Title: Thyroid): An examination of the thyroid will also include observation of the person as a whole, to look for systemic signs such as weight gain or loss, hair loss, and signs in other locations – such as protrusion of the eyes or swelling of the calves in Graves' disease. Tests Thyroid function tests include a battery of blood tests, including the measurement of the thyroid hormones, as well as the measurement of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). They may reveal hyperthyroidism (high T3 and T4), hypothyroidism (low T3, T4), or subclinical hyperthyroidism (normal T3 and T4 with a low TSH).
Document 3 (Title: Wilcoxon signed-rank test): Pratt observed that the reduced sample procedure can lead to paradoxical behavior. He gives the following example. Suppose that we are in the one-sample situation and have the following thirteen observations: 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 14, 15, 17, −18. The reduced sample procedure removes the zero. To the remaining data, it assigns the signed ranks: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, −12. This has a one-sided p-value of , and therefore the sample is not significantly positive at any significance level . Pratt argues that one would expect that decreasing the observations should certainly not make the data appear more positive. However, if the zero observation is decreased by an amount less than 2, or if all observations are decreased by an amount less than 1, then the signed ranks become: −1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, −13.
Document 4 (Title: An interaction between thyroid hormone and nerve growth factor promotes the development of hippocampus, olfactory bulbs and cerebellum: a comparative biochemical study of normal and hypothyroid rats.): The effects of treatment with L-thyroxine (T4;20 ng/g body weight, given subcutaneously on days 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9), 2.5 S nerve growth factor (NGF; 2 ng/mg brain weight, given intracerebroventricularly on days 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9), monoclonal anti-NGF (2 ng/mg wet weight, given intracerebroventricularly on days 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9), and monoclonal anti-NGF receptor (192 IgG; 2 ng/mg wet weight, injected daily from day 1 to day 9) antibodies, separately or together, were studied on the biochemical development of hippocampal formation, olfactory bulbs and cerebellum in 10-day-old and 15-day-old normal and hypothyroid rats. The results provide the following information: (1) CNS structures other than the basal forebrain are sensitive to NGF during early development. (2) Both normal and hypothyroid rats are more sensitive to NGF deprivation than NGF supplementation. (3) The effects of anti-NGF antibodies in normal rats are similar to those induced by anti-NGFr antibodies. (4) NGF alone had little or no effect, but intera...
Document 5 (Title: Thyroid function tests): Thyroid hormones Total thyroxine Total thyroxine is rarely measured, having been largely superseded by free thyroxine tests. Total thyroxine (Total T4) is generally elevated in hyperthyroidism and decreased in hypothyroidism. It is usually slightly elevated in pregnancy secondary to increased levels of thyroid binding globulin (TBG). Total T4 is measured to see the bound and unbound levels of T4. The total T4 is less useful in cases where there could be protein abnormalities. The total T4 is less accurate due to the large amount of T4 that is bound. The total T3 is measured in clinical practice since the T3 has decreased amount that is bound as compared to T4. Reference ranges depend on the method of analysis. Results should always be interpreted using the range from the laboratory that performed the test. Example values are: Free thyroxine Free thyroxine (fT4 or free T4) is generally elevated in hyperthyroidism and decreased in hypothyroidism.

Question: During hypothyroidism, the following sign(s) is/are observed:
Options:
1. A decrease in free T4
2. Nervousness
3. Hypothermia
4. Weight gain
5. Hypercholesterolemia
