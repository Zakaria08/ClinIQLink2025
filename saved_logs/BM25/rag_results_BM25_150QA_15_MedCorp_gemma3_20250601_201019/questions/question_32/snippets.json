        "content": "Psychoanalysis of a man with active alcoholism, who is able to resume recreational drinking, has never been described. Mr. A. began treatment in denial of his alcoholism. Analysis demonstrated an underlying splitting between his experiencing and observing ego. His analyst received a projection of his observing ego, the part that was worried about his drinking. Because this split was resolved within a therapeutic alliance, Mr. A. decided that he had been attacking and punishing himself with alcohol, and he elected to abstain from alcohol entirely. The first key event that lead up to this dramatic decision was a sense that his analyst was a separate person. The second, arriving for discussion within the analysis through a dream, was his conviction that he would have to choose either to continue to drink with loss of control at the cost of his analysis or that he would have to choose to continue analysis at the expense of having to stop drinking. Mr. A. then came to feel that his analyst was attacking and punishing him with a fee increase. After 15 months of complete abstinence, Mr. A. found that he could drink with rare symptoms, but he still felt saddled with an abusive analyst. Mr. A.'s rages about the fee came up most commonly right after weekend or vacation breaks in the analysis. But the interpretation of these rages as related to missing me were contemptuously regarded as attempts to force him into my psychoanalytic schema rather than regarding his experience as valid. There was a dramatic shift of our alliance when Mr. A. was given complete control over the fee. I was freed to interpret and reconstruct the underlying early relationship with his parents. The final part of this article describes Mr. A.'s working-through process, which stabilized his sense of autonomy and which reconstructed his early relationship with his parents.

This premonitory hemiparesis was called as \"herald hemiparesis\" by Fisher (1988). Its early detection is important because immediate anticoagulant therapy may prevent its evolution. We reported two patients with such hemiparesis. The first case was a 71-year-old diabetic and hypertensive man who was admitted because of right hemiparesis, dysarthria and decreased spontaneous speech. Initially, his symptoms looked like those of a left cerebral lesion. CT scans revealed no fresh cerebrovascular lesion. A few hours later, a myoclonic movement appeared in his left lower limb, and right MLF syndrome developed. We thought he had basilar artery thrombosis and we started intravenous administration of heparin. But he developed tetraplegia with locked-in state. The second case was a 76-year-old diabetic and hypertensive man with a confusional state, right hemiparesis, dysarthria and conjugate gaze deviation to left. After admission, he rapidly became comatose and developed respiratory arrest. CT scans revealed low density areas in the brainstem, cerebellum and the occipital lobe. He died ten days later. Early detection of herald hemiparesis is by no means easy. However, severe dysarthria and myoclonic jerks in a patient with hemiparesis should be considered as warning signs to indicate the herald hemiparesis with subsequent severe brainstem infarction.",

After that, in 1986, he was aware of a weakness in the right arm and leg and of right sensory disturbances. Histopathological study of a biopsy specimen revealed a malignant lymphoma in the left thalamus, and the lesion was effectively treated by radiation to the brain. In 1987, he complained of visual disturbances in the left eye. According to the history and ocular manifestation, the disease was diagnosed as ocular reticulum cell sarcoma. Radiation therapy to his left orbital cavity was effective and inflammatory signs in the left eye subsided.",

        "content": "A 74-year-old right-handed man with multiple cerebral infarction who presented with dementia simulating dementia of Alzheimer type (DAT) is reported. He had been well until April 20, 1987 when he developed transient right hand palsy lasting overnight. Eleven days later, he became confused, disorientated, and amnestic. He was admitted to this hospital on June 8. Physical examination revealed hypertension (170/90mmHg). On neurological examination, his consciousness was clear but he was demented. He showed disorientation, amnesia, and urinary incontinence. His most prominent symptom was disturbance of speech, including fluent aphasia and alexia with agraphia. Additionally, he showed ideomotor apraxia, construction apraxia, right-left agnosia, finger agnosia, and acalculia. On July 9, he had a transient attack of right hemiplegia with confusion. The brain CT scan performed on admission was unremarkable except for cavum septi pellucidum and a small low density area in the right basal ganglia. However, single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) by 123I-labeled N-isopropyl-p-iodoamphetamine disclosed hypoperfusion of the cerebral blood flow in the border zones of the temporoparietal and frontal lobes on the left. A follow-up brain CT scan taken one month later demonstrated low density in the new areas corresponding to hypoperfusion shown by SPECT. Although the clinical features of the present case resembled those of DAT, dementia in this case was regarded as the result of multiple cerebral infarction since it occurred acutely with mild motor deficits, and brain CT scans and SPECT showed lesions indicating focal cerebral ischemia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "content": "A 49-year-old man was admitted to Mitsui Memorial Hospital because of fever of unknown origin. Since one year ago, he had often used intravenous narcotic drugs. Ten months before his admission, he had his first experience of fever and a chill. Four months later, he was admitted to a hospital under the diagnosis of pneumonia and he was treated successfully. After his discharge, he began to use drugs again, which resulted in the repetition of fever and chills during four months prior to his admission to our hospital. On admission, physical findings concerning the patient were unremarkable, except for mild hepatomegaly. ECG and chest X-ray were normal. Laboratory data revealed marked inflammatory changes and severe liver injury. Blood culture disclosed Campylobacter fetus and two dimensional echocardiography showed a large vegetation on the anterior tricuspid valve. He was diagnosed as isolated tricuspid infective endocarditis accompanied with acute hepatitis due to drug abuse. Moreover pulmonary perfusion scintigraphy showed decreased perfusion in the right lower lung field, which suggested that pneumonia of six months ago was due to septic pulmonary emboli from the infected tricuspid valve. The combined antibiotics therapy was successful. By the follow-up echocardiographic studies, the size of vegetation was observed to decrease progressively.",

        "content": "We reported clinical and neuropathological observations of a 41-year-old man with Degos disease. He first noted painless skin lesions over the upper extremities in January, 1982. Three years later he was diagnosed as Degos disease by skin biopsy, and treatment with aspirin was started. In September, 1985, he complained of paresthesia on his right arm, followed by a series of new neurological manifestations suggesting multifocal spinal cord lesions. On October 28, examination of admission showed papules with central umblication over the whole body except the head, face, palms, soles and scrotum. Neurological examination revealed no weakness, diminished right biceps reflex, exaggerated patellar reflexes and Achilles reflexes, left extensor plantar reflex, hypesthesia and hypalgesia to the level of Th8, mild left spastic gait, and retention of urine. In November, he had paraparesis, loss of vibration sense of lower extremities, hypesthesia and hypalgesia to the level of TH4, and weakness of right upper extremity. In December, he showed tetraplegia, left-sided facial palsy, and hypesthesia and hypalgesia to the level of C5. In January, 1986, he showed right facial palsy, left facial hypesthesia, pseudobulbar palsy. In February, he had bilateral abducens nerve palsy and hiccups. On February 18, he died of intracranial hemorrhages. He had episodic abdominal pain several times during admission. His condition deteriorated progressively in four months after the first manifestation of neurological symptoms, despite the therapy with heparin, urokinase, ticlopidine, dipyridamole, and prednisolone. Laboratory studies showed gradual increase of CSF proteins (from 156 mg/dl to 602 mg/dl) and extremely increased platelet aggregation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
