        "content": "The pathogenesis remains unknown in the majority of patients with precocious puberty, and yet infrequently such causative cerebral lesions as hypothalamic hamartomas are associated with sexual precocity. We reported a rare case of suprasellar arachnoid cyst in an infant presenting with precocious puberty, which eventually disappeared after a cyst-peritoneal shunt. It was believed that the mass effect of the arachnoid cyst upon the hypothalamus was, at least in part, responsible for development of precocious puberty. The role of surgical decompression of the cyst was also discussed. A one-year-old girl was admitted to the hospital for evaluation of genital bleeding which had persisted on and off for two months. The height, 80cm, and the weight, 12.4kg, exceeded by far the two standard deviations from the mean level of the normal population. In addition she had the development of breast tissue as classified Tanner's Stage II, and both pubic and axillary hair. The bone age by skeletal survey of the hand was rated as 3 years. Endocrinological examination showed that serum levels of luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol had increased for her age, to levels equivalent to those for females at puberty. An LH-RH test revealed an excessive LH reaction. There were no definite neurological deficits. CT and MRI demonstrated the presence of a large arachnoid cyst involving the suprasellar region as well as the right middle and posterior fossa. After the patient underwent a cyst-peritoneal shunt, the cyst decreased in size and such symptoms as genital bleeding and breast growth disappeared. Serum levels of her LH and FSH also significantly decreased.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "content": "We report a case of a 47-year-old woman with McCune-Albright syndrome associated with unusual growth-hormone and prolactin hypersecretion. Acromegaly was suspected on clinical examination, and she was referred to us. She had no history of precocious puberty or pathological fracture. She was 154cm tall, weighing 62kg with so-called acromegalic facies. There were two lumps, one of which was on her right lateral forehead. The other on the right lower extremity seemed to be due to a bone deformity. Some brown pigmented macules with irregular borders were present on her lips and oral mucosa. Endocrine examination revealed elevated basal levels of plasma GH (54ng/ml) and PRL (36.2ng/ml), which paradoxically increased after injection of TRH. Plasma levels of these hormones did not change after LHRH test, and plasma GH level increased after GHRH test. A skull X-ray film showed a double floor of the sella turcia and hyperostotic formation of the right sphenoid bone. MRI and CT showed a tumor shadow in the right sella turcica. Bone roentogenography of the right fibula and tibia showed a large centrally expanding lesion with a ground-glass or cystic appearance and a thin cortex. The left fibula showed a similar lesion. We recognized similar findings in other bones which also showed abnormal accumulation in a radionuclide bone scan with 99mTc. On the basis of physical, endocrinological and roentogenographical examination, we diagnosed her as displaying McCune-Albright syndrome. We operated on her by transsphenoidal surgery and confirmed a functioning chromophobe adenoma which was removed during surgery. She has been free of GH and PRL hypersecretion since then. The pathology of the sphenoidal sinus affected with fibrous bone was in accordance with the findings of fibrous dysplasia. McCune-Albright syndrome (MCAS) is known as a syndrome characterized by polyostotic fibrous dysplasia and cutaneous pigmentation and multiple endocrinopathy. Its etiology is unknown. This syndrome with acromegaly is rare, and although 26 cases have been described in literature, pathological examinations have been undertaken in only three cases. This case was very rare and valuable because, by operating on her by the transsphenoidal route in spite of the sphenoidal sinus being affected with fibrous bone, we were able to confirm a chromophobe adenoma secreting both GH and PRL. We recognized that acromegaly with MCAS was endocrinologically, morphologically and immunohistologically the same as acromegaly without MCAS. Therefore, we concluded that acromegaly with MCAS is much the same as acromegaly without MCAS.",

Postoperative course was uneventful and her growth rate returned to normal range. CT scans after radiation therapy of 49 Gy showed marked decrease in size of the tumor. At 3 years and 6 months of age, enlargement of her breast was pointed out although MRI indicated no enlargement of the tumor. Basal value of LH, FSH, E 1 and E 2 elevated and LHRH test showed over-response of LH and FSH. Other hypothalamic-pituitary functions were partially preserved.

Children with adrenocortical oncocytomas will present with \"premature pubarche, clitoromegaly, and increased serum dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate and testosterone\" which are some of the presentations associated with precocious puberty. Precocious puberty in girls begins before the age of 8. The youngest mother on record is Lina Medina, who gave birth at the age of either 5 years, 7 months and 17 days or 6 years 5 months as mentioned in another report. \"Central precocious puberty (CPP) was reported in some patients with suprasellar arachnoid cysts (SAC), and SCFE (slipped capital femoral epiphysis) occurs in patients with CPP because of rapid growth and changes of growth hormone secretion.\" If no cause can be identified, it is considered idiopathic or constitutional.",

        "content": "We describe three patients in whom at the age of 4-7 yrs the diagnosis adrenogenital syndrome (21-hydroxylase deficiency) was made. There was no salt-loss. Two boys presented with precocious pubic hair development and increased growth velocity and bone maturation. The third patient was a severely virilized girl raised as a boy until she was 4 yrs old. Following an extensive psychiatric evaluation, it was decided to raise her as a girl and feminoplasty was performed. Clinical and biochemical evidence of central precocious puberty was present in one boy at the time of diagnosis at age 7 and developed under hydrocortisone substitution therapy in the two other patients. The precocious puberty was treated in two patients with the anti-androgen cyproterone acetate. In one boy suppression of pituitary gonadotropin secretion was obtained by LH-RH analogue (Buserelin) treatment.",

        "content": "High levels of beta-hCG in serum and cerebrospinal fluid observed in a 9-year-old boy suggest a pineal gland tumor. The tumor is called a chorionic gonadotropin secreting pineal tumor. Radiotherapy and chemotherapy reduced tumor and beta-hCG levels normalized. In a study using neonatal melatonin on rats, results suggest that elevated melatonin could be responsible for some cases of early puberty. Familial cases of idiopathic central precocious puberty (ICPP) have been reported, leading researchers to believe there are specific genetic modulators of ICPP. Mutations in genes such as LIN28, and LEP and LEPR, which encode leptin and the leptin receptor, have been associated with precocious puberty. The association between LIN28 and puberty timing was validated experimentally in vivo, when it was found that mice with ectopic over-expression of LIN28 show an extended period of pre-pubertal growth and a significant delay in puberty onset.",

        "content": "Hypothalamic hamartoma is reported to be associated with precocious puberty. Here, the authors present a seven-year-old girl whose onset of puberty occurred at the age of two. Under the impression of idiopathic precocious puberty, cyproterone acetate was initially tried. Since the effect of her medication was not satisfactory, it was discontinued at the age of five years and 11 months. However, rapid advance of bone age and vaginal spotting recurred after the withdrawal of treatment. She was re-evaluated at the age of six, and a magnetic resonance image (MRI) study of the head revealed a hypothalamic hamartoma. At that time, a long-acting analog of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRHa), leuprolide acetate, was prescribed. Her secondary sex characteristics regressed and her hypothalamic-pituitary-gonad axis was suppressed after treatment. The clinical presentation, mechanism and treatment of precocious puberty caused by hypothalamic hamartomas are fully discussed in this report.",
