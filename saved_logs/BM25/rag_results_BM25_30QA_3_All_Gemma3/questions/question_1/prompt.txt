Document 1 (Title: Comparison of Landolt C and Snellen E Acuity in Strabismus Amblyopia): Purpose: Assessment of visual acuity depends on the optotypes used for measurement. The ability to recognize different optotypes differs even if their critical detail appears under the same visual angle. Since optotypes are evaluated on individuals with good visual acuity and without eye disorders, differences in the lower visual acuity range cannot be excluded. In this study, visual acuity measured with the Snellen E was compared to the Landolt C acuity. Methods: 100 patients (age 8–90 years, median 60.5 years) with different eye disorders, among them 39 with amblyopia due to strabismus, and 13 healthy volunteers (age 18–33 years, median 24 years) were tested. Visual acuity assessment was performed using charts with the Snellen E and the Landolt C (Precision Vision) which mimic the ETDRS charts. 3 out of 5 optotypes per line had to be correctly identified, while wrong answers were monitored. In the group of patients, the eyes with the lower visual acuity, and for the healthy subjects, the right eyes were evaluated. Results: Differences between Landolt C and Snellen E acuity were small. The mean decimal values for Landolt C and Snellen E were 0.25±0.4 and 0.29±0.4 in the entire group and 0.14±0.8 and 0.16±0.8 for the eyes with strabismus amblyopia. The mean difference between Landolt C and Snellen E was 0.55 lines in the entire group and 0.55 lines for the eyes with strabismus amblyopia, with higher values for the Snellen E in both groups. In the acuity range below 0.1, the mean difference between Landolt C and Snellen E was 0.58 lines for the entire group and 0.58 lines for the eyes with strabismic amblyopia with higher values for the Snellen E in both groups. Conclusions: Using the charts described, there was a slight overestimation of visual acuity by the Snellen E compared to the Landolt C, even in strabismus amblyopia. Small differences in the lower visual acuity range have to be considered.
Document 2 (Title: Visual acuity): The precise distance at which acuity is measured is not important as long as it is sufficiently far away and the size of the optotype on the retina is the same. That size is specified as a visual angle, which is the angle, at the eye, under which the optotype appears. For 6/6 = 1.0 acuity, the size of a letter on the Snellen chart or Landolt C chart is a visual angle of 5 arc minutes (1 arc min = 1/60 of a degree). By the design of a typical optotype (like a Snellen E or a Landolt C), the critical gap that needs to be resolved is 1/5 this value, i.e., 1 arc min. The latter is the value used in the international definition of visual acuity:
Document 3 (Title: Snellen Chart -- Definition/Introduction): Tumbling E: Dr. Snellen also developed this chart, which he designed for children and those unable to read or unfamiliar with the Roman alphabet. This chart displays a capital letter E facing in various directions. While observing each character, the patient points in the direction that the E is facing. Landolt C: Comparable to the Tumbling E, this chart displays a C - which some say appears more similar to a broken ring - facing in various directions. The chart was developed by the Swiss ophthalmologist Landolt and is regarded as a laboratory standard by the International Council of Ophthalmology. LEA Symbols Chart : This chart was designed for visual acuity screening in children to eliminate the problems of language barriers. The chart utilizes symbols and creates a play environment to entertain the pediatric patient during the exam. Vivekanand et al. determined that the LEA symbols chart performs better than the Snellen chart for visual acuity assessments in preschool children. [4]
