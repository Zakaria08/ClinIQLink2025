        "title": "[A case of miliary tuberculosis associated with acute respiratory failure during pregnancy].",
        "content": "A case of miliary tuberculosis associated with acute respiratory failure during pregnancy was reported. A 39-year-old, 29-week pregnant woman was admitted to our hospital with complaints of nonproductive cough and fever on June 12. On admission, her temperature was 38.2 degrees C; pulse rate was 90/min., and blood pressure was 120/76 mmHg. Physical examination revealed moist rales at right lung basis. Chest X-ray showed small nodular infiltrates in right lower lung field. Laboratory data revealed positive CRP, accelerated ESR and increased level of alpha 2-globulin. The number of T-cells was markedly decreased (14/mm3). The PPD skin test was negative, and the sputum smears for acid-fast bacilli were negative. Suspected of bacterial or viral pneumonia, the patient was treated with antibiotics (CPM, EM and CAZ), which had no effects for her. On June 16, the Chest X-ray showed infiltrates throughout bilateral lung fields, and the patient became increasingly dyspneic. On June 18, the results of arterial blood gas, analysis under room air were: PaO2 26.7 Torr, PaCO2 29.0 Torr, pH 7.505. Because of severe hypoxemia, she was intubated and placed on a volume-cycled respirator. Hydrocortisone (1000 mg, daily) was added to treatment because ARDS was suspected. Since the smears of tracheobronchial secretions showed acid-fast bacilli on June 24, she was diagnosed to have miliary tuberculosis. Then the intensive therapy with antituberculosis drugs (isoniazid 400 mg, rifampicin 450 mg, and streptomycin 1g, daily) was started. The non specific antibiotics were discontinued; hydrocortisone was tapered and stopped. The next week, she became afebrile and hypoxemia steadily improved.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "content": "A case of congenital, isolated tricuspid regurgitation is reported. A 48 year old woman has been admitted because of shortness of breath and progressive fatigue. Although the heart murmur had been heard in her childhood, the first symptoms appeared when she was 25. One year later she underwent a plastic surgery of tricuspid valve. During the following 20 years she remained asymptomatic, until dyspnea and fatigue developed again. On admission she was cyanotic and positive, systolic jugular venous pulse was seen. Atrial flutter was present and no systolic cardiac murmur was heart. The liver was enlarged without peripheral oedema. Echo-Doppler examination and cardiac catheterisation revealed huge right cardiac chambers and significant tricuspid regurgitation. During reoperation a valve consisting of only two cusps was found with extremely dilated valvular anulus. A Bex valvuloplasty was successfully performed. One month later a control echo-Doppler showed the diminution of right ventricle and right atrium with hardly visible regurgitant jet. The pathogenesis and the course of this extremely rare disease have been also discussed in the paper.",
