Document 1 (Title: KOH test): Evaluation Dermatophytes are easily recognized under the microscope by their long branch-like tubular structures called hyphae. Fungi causing ringworm infections produce septate (segmented) hyphae. Some show the presence of spores formed directly from the hyphae (arthroconidia). Under the microscope Tinea versicolor is recognized by curved hyphae and round yeast forms that give it a spaghetti-and-meatball appearance. Yeast cells appear round or oval and budding forms may be seen. The KOH prep cannot identify the specific organism; the specimen can be submitted for fungal culture to identify the organism. A normal, or negative, KOH test shows no fungi (no dermatophytes or yeast). Dermatophytes or yeast seen on a KOH test indicate the person has a fungal infection. Follow-up tests are usually unnecessary. The skin may be sore after the test because of the tissue being scraped off the top of the surface of the skin. References
Document 2 (Title: Dermatophyte): Trichophyton: rubrum, tonsurans, mentagrophytes, verrucosum, and schoenlenii Microsporum: canis, audouinii, and gypseum Epidermophyton: floccosum About 76% of the dermatophyte species isolated from humans are Trichophyton rubrum. 27% are Trichophyton mentagrophytes 7% are Trichophyton verrucosum 3% are Trichophyton tonsurans Infrequently isolated (less than 1%) are Epidermophyton floccosum, Microsporum audouinii, Microsporum canis, Microsporum equinum, Microsporum nanum, Microsporum versicolor, Trichophyton equinum, Trichophyton kanei, Trichophyton raubitschekii, and Trichophyton violaceum. The mixture of species is quite different in domesticated animals and pets (see ringworm for details). Epidemiology Since dermatophytes are found worldwide, infections by these fungi are extremely common. Infections occur more in males than in females, as the predominantly female hormone, progesterone, inhibits the growth of dermatophyte fungi.
Document 3 (Title: Athlete's foot): Causes Athlete's foot is a form of dermatophytosis (fungal infection of the skin), caused by dermatophytes, fungi (most of which are mold) which inhabit dead layers of skin and digest keratin. Dermatophytes are anthropophilic, meaning these parasitic fungi prefer human hosts. Athlete's foot is most commonly caused by the molds known as Trichophyton rubrum and T. mentagrophytes, but may also be caused by Epidermophyton floccosum. Most cases of athlete's foot in the general population are caused by T. rubrum; however, the majority of athlete's foot cases in athletes are caused by T. mentagrophytes.
Document 4 (Title: Dermatophyte): The course of infection varies between each case, and may be determined by several factors including: "the anatomic location, the degree of skin moisture, the dynamics of skin growth and desquamation, the speed and extent of the inflammatory response, and the infecting species." The ring shape of dermatophyte lesions result from outward growth of the fungi. The fungi spread in a centrifugal pattern in the stratum corneum, which is the outermost keratinized layer of the skin. For nail infections, the growth initiates through the lateral or superficial nail plates, then continues throughout the nail. For hair infections, fungal invasion begins at the hair shaft. Symptoms manifest from inflammatory reactions due to the fungal antigens. The rapid turnover of desquamation, or skin peeling, due to inflammation limits dermatophytoses, as the fungi are pushed out of the skin.
Document 5 (Title: Dermatophyte test medium): Dermatophyte test medium (DTM) is a specialized agar used in medical mycology. It is based on Sabouraud's dextrose agar with added cycloheximide to inhibit saprotrophic growth, antibiotic to inhibit bacterial growth, and phenol red a pH indicator. The pH indicator is useful in distinguishing a dermatophyte fungus, which utilizes nitrogenous material for preferred metabolism, producing alkaline by-products, imparting a red color change to the medium. Typical saprotrophic fungi utilize carbohydrates in the medium producing acidic by-products and no red color change. References Mycology Microbiological media
