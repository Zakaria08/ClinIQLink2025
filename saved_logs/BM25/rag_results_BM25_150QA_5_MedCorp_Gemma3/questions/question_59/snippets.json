        "title": "Can short hospital admissions be avoided? A review of admissions of less than 24 hours' duration in a paediatric teaching hospital.",
        "content": "To review the records of children admitted to hospital for less than 24 hours to assess the appropriateness of the admission and subsequent discharge, and the suitability of these patients for admission to a short stay area rather than the hospital wards. Retrospective study consisting of a one in three sample of all children admitted to the hospital's general medical units over one year. All admissions were listed sequentially, and every third patient was included in the study. Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne; a tertiary paediatric hospital with a major primary care role. There were a total of 660 patients eligible for inclusion in the study; 220 were selected, and all records were reviewed. It was found that although 87.7% of admissions could be justified on medical grounds alone, the children quickly recovered with at least 65% being fit for discharge within 12 hours of admission. In spite of this the mean duration of admission was 17.0 hours. The majority of patients were suffering from easily diagnosed and treated disorders, with 78.9% falling into four diagnostic groups (asthma, ingestions, infections, and convulsions). Criteria for admission to a short stay observation area were satisfied in 65% of patients (at the time of the study no such area existed in the hospital). No patients were discharged inappropriately early. A significant number of children require brief hospitalisation for relatively minor illness, but unnecessary delays caused by administrative aspects of hospital admission and relatively infrequent inpatient review by medical staff often lengthen the period of admission. Significant cost savings are possible with the use of a short stay facility, and a large number of patients are suitable for this form of care.",

        "title": "[Activity of pediatric emergency departments in 1991].",
        "content": "The authors report the results of a prospective survey concerning the children examined in the pediatric emergency ward of the Lenval's hospital in Nice. The study was conducted over a period of 124 days, one month of each season, and included 3,611 children. There was a majority of boys (60.8%) and children older than 7 years (56.8%). The representation of foreign children was 11.2%. Most of the consultations were decided by the parents (86%); 6.2% were sent by a general practitioner and 1.1% by a pediatrician; 6.5% were conveyed through a professional public health service transport. Traumatology was the main surgical etiology and supplied the large majority of benign cases and 23% of the emergencies. Upper respiratory and bronchopulmonary tract infections and gastroenteritis represented 70% of medical etiologies. A complementary investigation, essentially a radiological examination, was carried out in 53.6% of cases. A wound suture was performed in 13% and a plaster immobilization in 9.2% of cases. The hospitalisation's rate was 22%. Emergencies represented 1.8% of cases. A surgical intervention with general anesthesia was performed in 4.4% of cases within 12 hours following the admission. A recent law (ministerial circular: 14.05, 1991) defines the organisation and working principles of the public emergency departments in France as requiring an uninterrupted activity, a continuous medical presence and an area for very short hospitalization. This should improve the quality of the pediatric emergency wards, providing that the financial means will be available.",

        "title": "Psychological stress, ego defenses, and cortisol production in children hospitalized for elective surgery.",
        "content": "This study was designed to investigate the relationship between the effectiveness of coping mechanisms and physiological indicators of distress in children faced with the experience of hospitalization and surgery. Twenty-five children between the ages of 7 and 11 were studied in the out-patient department, 2 weeks before surgery, and again during their hospital stay. Effectiveness of defenses and defense style was measured by a clinical interview and by the Rorschach test. Cortisol production rates were measured by the analysis of 24-hour urine collections at home and again in the hospital. Ward adjustment was also rated by a ward questionnaire. The results indicated no relationship between defense effectiveness and cortisol production rates in the out-patient department and an inverse relationship between cortisol production and defense effectiveness under the stress of hospitalization. Defense style was found to correlate with coping under stress. Four different groups of children emerged, suggesting four different types of reaction to the hospital experience.",

        "content": "In a trial of 360 patients with hernia or varicose veins, day care surgery provided an economic alternative to the provision of surgical aftercare either in the surgical wards of a district hospital or in a convalescent hospital. There was only slightly more work for general practitioners. Most of the additional work for the community services was carried out by district nurses, with an average contact time in the postoperative period of 325 minutes for day care patients, compared with 186 minutes and 204 minutes respectively for patients admitted for 48 hours to the surgical or convalescent wards. Day care produced estimated savings of 30 pounds compared with the costs of a 48-hour stay in the surgical wards, and savings of 22 pounds compared with a 48-hour stay in the convalescent wards.",
