        "content": "An autopsy case of HTLV-I associated myelopathy (HAM) was reported. The patient was a 55-year-old man from Kagoshima, who had no history of blood transfusion. He was admitted to our hospital because of muscle weakness of legs and dysuria, which having since one month ago. On admission, he was able to walk with assistance, but his legs were severely spastic, and Babinski's sign was positive bilaterally. Superficial sensation was normal, but vibration sense was mildly decreased in his legs. CSF showed mild mononuclear pleocytosis with elevated protein. Myelogram and CT were normal. Serum and CSF antibodies to HTLV-I were positive at titers of X4,096 and X128, respectively by immunofluorescent assay, and specific IgG bands (p19, p24, p28 and p53 in serum and p19, p24, p53 in CSF) were detected by western blot analysis. His paraparesis continued to worsen. He became bed-ridden within 2 months. He was received corticosteroid medication. He regained the ability to walk with assistance, and continued taking corticosteroid. In July 4, 1986, macrohematuria appeared and inoperable transitional cell carcinoma of rt. kidney was found by further examination. Chemotherapy were not effective against the carcinoma and he died on July 21, 1987. Neuropathological findings were summarized as follows: cerebral hemisphere was normal except for mild cellular infiltration in the leptomeninges; lesions consisted in unilateral pyramidal tract of pons &amp; medulla and in partial anterior, posterior and lateral columns of the spinal cord; demyelination with axonal degeneration, marked gliosis, numerous lipid-laden macrophages and mild perivascular infiltration of mononuclear cells in these areas.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "content": "A 60 year-old man was admitted to our hospital because of gait disturbance and dizziness. At 57 years of age, he noticed his walking unstable. After then, he had dizziness due to orthostatic hypotension, urinary difficulty, loss of livid, and forgetfulness. Neurological examination revealed he had severe orthostatic hypotension, cerebellar ataxia, dysarthria, hyperreflexia of four limbs, myoclonus of right leg, and atonic bladder. His brain CT showed cerebellar atrophy. Thereafter he had recurrent syncopic attacks. His gait disturbance progressed steadily, so he became bedridden. In his terminal stage, his limbs showed rigidity. About 3 years later he died of pneumonia and sepsis. At autopsy brain weighted 1,230 g. Glossly the putamens was bilaterally shrunken, the color of the substantia nigra and locus ceruleus became pale. Base of the pons and the cerebellum were atrophic. Microscopical examination confirmed the degeneration of striato-nigral and olivo-ponto-cerebellar systems without Lewy body. In the spinal cord there was depletion of neuronal cells in the intermediolateral nuclei and Onufrowitz nuclei. In addition to the conventional neuropathological staining methods, we performed the immunohistochemical studies using monoclonal antibody against synthetic peptide of beta protein which detected senile plaque of every stages with formic acid pretreatment, and compared to the modified Bielschowsky method and Congo red method. Our case showed many very primitive and primitive senile plaque in neocortices and hippocampal region. A few neurofibrally tangle were seen in hippocampus. We supposed our case might combine multiple system atrophy and Alzheimer' pathology.",

        "content": "A 42-year-old man suffered from numbness in his right leg in May, 1989, and was admitted to another hospital for examination. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed thoracic intramedullary tumor and multiple intracranial tumors in the right frontal convexity, the right lower surface of the tentorium and the right parietal parasagittal region. In December, he underwent craniotomy and the right frontal tumor was totally removed. It was diagnosed histologically as meningioma. Because of continuing numbness in his right leg, he visited a neurologist at our university and was referred to us for removal of the spinal tumor on April 25, 1990. Neurological examination on admission revealed mild weakness of his right leg and exaggerated right knee jerk. Though he complained of numbness in his right leg, no sensory disturbance was demonstrated objectively. His bladder-bowel function was normal. There were no caf\u00e9 au lait spots or subcutaneous neurofibromas. He and his mother were positive for anti-HTLV-1 (human T-lymphotrophic virus type 1) antibody. On May 1, laminectomy was performed at Th-7 to Th-9, and a yellowish brown tumor was found occupying the right posterolateral portion of the cord and extending to the surface. The dorsal root of Th-9, which was involved in the tumor, was cut and the tumor was subtotally removed. Histological examination showed interlacing bundles of spindle cells and loose areolar region. Immunohistochemically, the tumor was positive for S-100 protein and negative for GFAP. From these findings, the tumor was diagnosed as neurinoma. The postoperative course was uneventful, numbness disappeared, and the patient was discharged without neurological deficits.",

He had suffered from a severe head injury incurred in a traffic accident with brief unconsciousness 6 months before admission. Three weeks after his injury, tremor and rigidity in the right upper limb developed, and he walked dragging his right leg. Five months after his injury, he received 1-dopa therapy, exhibiting a moderate improvement in parkinsonian symptoms. On admission, he was demented to a mild degree with masked face and monotonous speech. He presented with resting-postural-kinetic tremor and muscle rigidity on the right side. Cranial CT and MRI showed no abnormality. Inter-peak latencies of waves III to V of BAEP were significantly longer in this patient than in normal subjects. This BAEP findings suggested an upper brainstem lesion. 123I-IMP SPECT disclosed decreased cerebral blood flow in the left thalamus, bilateral frontal and parietal cortices. We diagnosed this case as having posttraumatic parkinsonism. Parkinsonism in the present case may be due to the involvement of multiple neuronal circuits of the extrapyramidal system at the level of the midbrain to the thalamus.",
