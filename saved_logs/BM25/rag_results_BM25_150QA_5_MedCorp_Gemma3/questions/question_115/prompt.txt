Document 1 (Title: Paracetamol poisoning in children and hepatotoxicity.): 1. Paracetamol is one of the most common drugs that children accidentally ingest. Unlike the situation in adults, death and hepatotoxicity in children from paracetamol poisoning are exceedingly uncommon events. A review of the literature has revealed only seven deaths and fourteen cases of hepatotoxicity in children, with most of the cases resulting from chronic poisoning and not acute poisoning. 2. Children may be less prone to paracetamol hepatotoxicity because of developmental differences in the drug's metabolism and its pathways of detoxification. In the therapeutic setting of treatment of fever and pain in children, paracetamol is regarded as a drug with a higher therapeutic index, and as such, there seems to be little concern with strict adherence to dosage regimes. 3. Scrutiny of the above paediatric cases associated with chronic paracetamol poisoning suggests that the margin of safety of frequent therapeutic doses of paracetamol in infants and young children to be a lot lower than previously appreciated. This review highlights the need to re-evaluate the safety of paracetamol in the context of chronic therapy in infants and young children.
Document 2 (Title: Hepatotoxicity of paracetamol enhanced by ingestion of alcohol: report of two cases.): Two fatal cases of poisoning by paracetamol are described. Both patients were heavy imbibers of alcohol and both had swallowed less paracetamol that that generally regarded as a lethal dose. The biochemistry of paracetamol hepatotoxicity is outlined and the increased susceptibility of alcoholic patients to the hepatotoxic effects of paracetamol is remarked upon. Recent trends in the treatment of acute paracetamol poisoning are mentioned.
Document 3 (Title: [Hemoperfusion with coated activated charcoal for treating acute poisoning by remedies, plant protectants, and fungi. I. Remedies (author's transl)].): Hemoperfusion with coated activated charcoal is a novel procedure for treating acute poisoning. It enables the elimination of both, water-soluble and liposoluble toxins. Hemoperfusion with coated activated charcoal has proved to be superior to hemodialysis in the treatment of barbiturate or bromocarbamide poisoning both under experimental conditions as well as in the ward. Analogous statements may be made for the therapy of glutethimide poisoning. Methaqualone, on the other hand, could not be eliminated sufficiently well in animal trials. Intoxications by "mild" analgetics, such as paracetamol and acetylsalicylic acid, may be treated successfully with hemoperfusion. Treatment of acetylsalicylic acid poisoning is equally effective with hemoperfusion as with hemodialysis. Prospects for the success of hemoperfusion in treating intoxication from tricyclic antidepressants and neuroliptics are slight. It is simply the danger of antidepressant poisoning that justifies using this method of treatment in the first few hours after ingestion in order to reduced the flow of the psychopharmaceutical substance into the tissue.
Document 4 (Title: Predicate transformer semantics): Monotonic Predicate transformers of interest (wp, wlp, and sp) are monotonic. A predicate transformer T is monotonic if and only if: This property is related to the consequence rule of Hoare logic. Strict A predicate transformer T is strict iff: For instance, wp is strict, whereas wlp is generally not. In particular, if statement S may not terminate then is satisfiable. We have Indeed, true is a valid invariant of that loop. Terminating A predicate transformer T is terminating iff: Actually, this terminology makes sense only for strict predicate transformers: indeed, is the weakest-precondition ensuring termination of S. It seems that naming this property non-aborting would be more appropriate: in total correctness, non-termination is abortion, whereas in partial correctness, it is not. Conjunctive A predicate transformer T is conjunctive iff: This is the case for , even if statement S is non-deterministic as a selection statement or a specification statement.
Document 5 (Title: Intravenous N-acetylcysteine, hepatotoxicity and plasma glutathione S-transferase in patients with paracetamol overdosage.): The concentration of glutathione S-transferase B1 (GST B1) subunits was measured in sequential plasma samples taken at frequent intervals for 48 h from ten patients with severe paracetamol poisoning who were treated with intravenous N-acetylcysteine. No significant increase in plasma GST B1 concentration was observed over the study period and with 4 h of starting treatment with N-acetylcysteine there were significant decreases in plasma GST B1 concentrations. None of the patients subsequently developed significant liver damage. At the dose used for the treatment of paracetamol poisoning, N-acetylcysteine has no hepatotoxic effects.

Answer the following list question.
Question: Select the correct statement(s) regarding paracetamol poisoning:
Options:
1. Early administration of activated charcoal decreases the bioavailability of paracetamol
2. N-acetylcysteine used orally, in combination with activated charcoal, loses its detoxifying activity
3. Acute tubular nephropathy constitutes an early sign of intoxication
4. Early gastric lavage constitutes an essential therapeutic measure
5. The toxifying metabolic pathway uses cytochrome P450
