The use of radiotherapy in colon cancer is not routine due to the sensitivity of the bowels to radiation. As with chemotherapy, radiotherapy can be used as a neoadjuvant for clinical stages T3 and T4 for rectal cancer. This results in downsizing or downstaging of the tumour, preparing it for surgical resection, and also decreases local recurrence rates. For locally advanced rectal cancer, neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy has become the standard treatment. Additionally, when surgery is not possible radiation therapy has been suggested to be an effective treatment against CRC pulmonary metastases, which are developed by 10-15% of people with CRC.",

A 2015 article reports that pelvic exenteration can provide long-term survival for patients with locally advanced primary rectal carcinoma. The 5-year survival rate of patients undergoing pelvic exenteration following complete resection of disease was 59.3%. Factors shown to influence the survival rate following a pelvic exenteration procedure include age, the presence of metastatic disease, lymph node status, circumferential resection margin, local recurrence of disease, and the need for neoadjuvant therapy. History The procedure was first described by Alexander Brunschwig in 1948. References Surgical oncology Female genital procedures",

        "content": "TAFAZZIN has been found to be highly expressed in gastric cancer cells resistant to cisplatin. This resistance was identified to be due to the acquired ability of the cancer cells to undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The findings that TAFAZZIN is involved in inducing EMT as well as its high levels in these cancer cells may point to its involvement in gastric cancer. TAFAZZIN overexpression has been linked to rectal cancer, prostate cancer, thyroid neoplasm, and cervical cancer. In a study of 140 Swedish rectal cancer patients, TAFAZZIN overexpression was associated with an increase in the expression of oncogenes (FXYD-3 and Livin). It was also found to enhance cell anti-apoptosis response and abnormal cell growth and was even found to be an indicator of rectal cancer's stage, type, and progression. Additionally, the levels of TAFAZZIN were connected to the radiotherapy response of the patients, potentially offering insight into cancer recurrence in patients. A",
