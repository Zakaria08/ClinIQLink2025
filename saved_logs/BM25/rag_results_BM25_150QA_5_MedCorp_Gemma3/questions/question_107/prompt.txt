Document 2 (Title: Construction of a fast, inexpensive rapid-scanning diode-array detector and spectrometer.): A 512-element diode-array spectroscopic detection system capable of acquiring multiple spectra at a rate of 5 ms per spectrum with an effective scan rate of 102.9 kHz has been constructed. Spectra with fewer diode elements can also be acquired at scan rates up to 128 kHz. The detector utilizes a Hamamatsu silicon photodiode-array sensor that is interfaced to Hamamatsu driver/amplifier and clock generator boards and a DRA laboratories 12-bit 160-kHz analog-to-digital converter. These are standard, commercially available devices which cost approximately $3500. The system is interfaced to and controlled by an IBM XT microcomputer. Detailed descriptions of the home-built detector housing and control/interface circuitry are presented and its application to the study of the reaction of horseradish peroxidase with hydrogen peroxide is demonstrated.
Document 3 (Title: Apache Point Observatory Lunar Laser-ranging Operation): The increased optical gain brings some problems due to the possibility of getting more than one returned photon per pulse. The most novel component of the APOLLO system is the integrated array of Single-Photon Avalanche Diodes (SPADs) used in the detector. This technology is needed to deal with multiple photon returns within each pulse. Most single photon detectors suffer from "dead time": they cannot detect a photon if it arrives soon after another. This means that if more than one photon comes back in a single pulse, a conventional single-photon detector would only record the arrival time of the first photon. However, the important quantity is the centroid of the time of all returned photons (assuming the pulse and reflectors are symmetrical), so any system that can return multiple photons per pulse must record the arrival times of each photon. In APOLLO, the incoming photons are spread over an array of independent detectors, which reduces the chance that two or more photons hit
Document 4 (Title: Miniature silicon diode matrix-detector for in vivo measurement of 133xenon disappearance in the canine myocardium following local tissue injection.): After local tissue depositioning of 133Xenon (133Xe) the regional washout is usually registered by a NaI(Tl) detector. The residual radioactivity of 133Xe is usually measured at its 81 keV photopeak. However, using small Silicon (Si) photodiodes it is feasible to measure only the low-energy activity in the X-ray energy range. In the myocardium of open chest dogs 133Xe washout measurements by a matrix of Si diodes composed in a 4 x 4 array and a conventional NaI(Tl) detector were carried out simultaneously. Fourteen separate pairs of measurements were performed in 3 dogs. When the Si-diodes in the matrix were selected individually in accordance to the position with reference to the diode with maximum count rate or pooled, comparisons could be made between the corresponding washout rate constants measured by the reference detector. In the correlation between the rate constants the intercepts with the y axis were not significantly different from zero allowing the correlation lines to be fitted through (0.0). The slope of the correlation line was close to unity. The registration of the low-X-ray energy of 133Xe by the Si-detectors is an alternative to the conventional high energy activity recording appearing from the gamma-energy of the photopeak. The detector matrix concept allows elimination of motion artefacts and indicator distribution in the myocardial tissue. Due to the uniformity and low cost of Si-diodes the perspective may be the introduction as a disposable transducer useful during cardiac surgery for example.
Document 5 (Title: Ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy): The basic parts of a spectrophotometer are a light source, a holder for the sample, a diffraction grating in a monochromator or a prism to separate the different wavelengths of light, and a detector. The radiation source is often a Tungsten filament (300–2500 nm), a deuterium arc lamp, which is continuous over the ultraviolet region (190–400 nm), Xenon arc lamp, which is continuous from 160 to 2,000 nm; or more recently, light emitting diodes (LED) for the visible wavelengths. The detector is typically a photomultiplier tube, a photodiode, a photodiode array or a charge-coupled device (CCD). Single photodiode detectors and photomultiplier tubes are used with scanning monochromators, which filter the light so that only light of a single wavelength reaches the detector at one time. The scanning monochromator moves the diffraction grating to "step-through" each wavelength so that its intensity may be measured as a function of wavelength. Fixed monochromators are used with CCDs and
