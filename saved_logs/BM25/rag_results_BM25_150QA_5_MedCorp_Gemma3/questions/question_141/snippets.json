        "content": "The clinical, analytical, evolutive and therapeutic aspects of 33 cases of polycythemia vera which were diagnosed according to the Polycythemia Vera Study Group criteria, are described. Mean age was 65 years with a slight predominance of females (54.5%). Hemorrhagic manifestations were the most frequent (67%) with a great number of patients with digestive manifestations consisting of GI hemorrhage, abdominal pain, portal or suprahepatic veins thrombosis. Splenomegaly was the most frequently found sign upon examination (73%). The mean hemoglobin leukocyte, and platelet levels were 18 g/dl, 16,000 mm3 and 738,000 mm3 respectively. It is note worthy the value of the erythropoietin for the differential diagnosis of secondary erythrocytosis as well as the value of the bone marrow histologic study which should be included in the diagnostic criteria of the disease. The evolution of the process is favorably altered by bleedings and chemotherapeutic cytoreduction which are often performed simultaneously.",

        "content": "Signs and symptoms People with polycythemia vera can be asymptomatic. A classic symptom of polycythemia vera is pruritus or itching, particularly after exposure to warm water (such as when taking a bath), which may be due to abnormal histamine release or prostaglandin production. Such itching is present in approximately 40% of patients with polycythemia vera. Gouty arthritis may be present in up to 20% of patients. Peptic ulcer disease is also common in patients with polycythemia vera; most likely due to increased histamine from mast cells, but may be related to an increased susceptibility to infection with the ulcer-causing bacterium H. pylori. Another possible mechanism for the development for peptic ulcer is increased histamine release and gastric hyperacidity related with polycythemia vera.",

One study found the median age at diagnosis to be 60 years, while a Mayo Clinic study in Olmsted County, Minnesota found that the highest incidence was in people aged 70\u201379 years. The overall incidence in the Minnesota population was 1.9 per 100,000 person-years, and the disease was more common in men than women. A cluster around a toxic site was confirmed in northeast Pennsylvania in 2008.

        "content": "Primary polycythemia Primary polycythemias are due to factors intrinsic to red cell precursors. Polycythemia vera (PCV), polycythemia rubra vera (PRV), or erythremia, occurs when excess red blood cells are produced as a result of an abnormality of the bone marrow. Often, excess white blood cells and platelets are also produced. PCV is classified as a myeloproliferative disease. Symptoms include headaches and vertigo, and signs on physical examination include an abnormally enlarged spleen and/or liver. In some cases, affected individuals may have associated conditions including high blood pressure or formation of blood clots. Transformation to acute leukemia is rare. Phlebotomy is the mainstay of treatment. A hallmark of polycythemia is an elevated hematocrit, with Hct > 55% seen in 83% of cases. A somatic (non-hereditary) mutation (V617F) in the JAK2 gene, also present in other myeloproliferative disorders, is found in 95% of cases.",
