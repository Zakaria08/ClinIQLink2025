Document 3 (Title: Obstetrical bleeding): Risk factors In rare cases, inherited bleeding disorders, like hemophilia, von Willebrand disease (vWD), or factor IX or XI deficiency, may cause severe postpartum hemorrhage, with an increased risk of death particularly in the postpartum period. The risk of postpartum hemorrhage in patients with vWD and carriers of hemophilia has been found to be 18.5% and 22% respectively. This pathology occurs due to the normal physiological drop in maternal clotting factors after delivery which greatly increases the risk of secondary postpartum hemorrhage. Another bleeding risk factor is thrombocytopenia, or decreased platelet levels, which is the most common hematological change associated with pregnancy induced hypertension. If platelet counts drop less than 100,000 per microliter the patient will be at a severe risk for inability to clot during and after delivery.

Document 5 (Title: EGF-like domain): Impaired coordination of calcium can result in serious disorders. Defective calcium binding to coagulation factor IX contributes to the development of hemophilia B. Individuals afflicted with this hereditary disease tend to develop hemorrhages, potentially leading to life-threatening conditions. The cause of hemophilia B is decreased activity or deficiency of blood coagulation factor IX. Point mutations resulting in decreased affinity of factor IX to calcium are thought to be implicated in this bleeding disorder. On a molecular basis, it appears that hemophilia B can be the result of an impaired ability to localize the Gla module efficiently, as it usually occurs after calcium coordination by the cbEGF module in fully functional factor IX. This defect is thought to impair the biological function of factor IX. A similar problem occurs in patients suffering from hemophilia B and carrying a mutation (Glu78Lys) in factor IX that prevents interaction of the two cbEGF modules with one
