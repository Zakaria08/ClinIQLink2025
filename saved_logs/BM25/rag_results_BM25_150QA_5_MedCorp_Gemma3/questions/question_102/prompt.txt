Document 1 (Title: Sinus bradycardia): Sinus bradycardia is commonly seen in normal healthy persons and athletes in the absence of pathophysiological diseases or conditions. Different factors or etiologies could lead to the dysfunction of the sinus node, causing a malformation or prolongation of the impulse. In terms of pathophysiological diseases, sinus rhythm may be caused by: Diseases/Conditions: Acute myocardial infarction, carotid sinus syndrome, eating disorders (such as anorexia nervosa), rhodotoxin poisoning, hypothermia, hypothyroidism, infections (such as diphtheria, acute rheumatic fever, or viral myocarditis), intrinsic disease of the SA node (such as sick sinus syndrome), Roemheld syndrome, sleep apnea Physiological causes: Increased vagal tone, increased intracranial pressure Medications, most commonly: digitalis glycosides, beta-blockers, quinidine, adenosine, calcium channel blockers, class I antiarrhythmic agents, ivabradine, clonidine, reserpine, cimetidine, lithium, amitriptyline
Document 2 (Title: Amitriptyline): Amitriptyline should be used with caution in patients with epilepsy, impaired liver function, pheochromocytoma, urinary retention, prostate enlargement, hyperthyroidism, and pyloric stenosis. In patients with the rare condition of shallow anterior chamber of eyeball and narrow anterior chamber angle, amitriptyline may provoke attacks of acute glaucoma due to dilation of the pupil. It may aggravate psychosis, if used for depression with schizophrenia, or precipitate the switch to mania in those with bipolar disorder. CYP2D6 poor metabolizers should avoid amitriptyline due to increased side effects. If it is necessary to use it, half dose is recommended. Amitriptyline can be used during pregnancy and lactation, in the cases when SSRI do not work.
Document 3 (Title: Digoxin immune fab): Regulatory information and clinical studies Case series have reported benefits from anti‐digoxin Fab, but data regarding the response in acute or chronic poisoning are conflicting. Recent observational data support an effect in acute poisoning, but efficacy in chronic poisoning be minimally effective in alleviating cardiac toxicities in chronic digoxin poisoning. Data also support outcomes of acute digoxin poisoning without use of anti‐digoxin Fab. A case series of 147 patients showed that not all cases of acute digoxin overdose require anti‐digoxin Fab, nor should anti‐digoxin Fab dose be calculated based on ingested dose. In contrast, a higher mortality (7.6%) was noted in a case series of acute and chronic digoxin and digitoxin poisoning despite Fab being used first line. Further, a retrospective case‐controlled study of chronic digoxin poisoning did not observe a beneficial effect of anti‐digoxin Fab on mortality.
Document 4 (Title: Poison): Most biocides, including pesticides, are created to act as acute poisons to target organisms, although acute or less observable chronic poisoning can also occur in non-target organisms (secondary poisoning), including the humans who apply the biocides and other beneficial organisms. For example, the herbicide 2,4-D imitates the action of a plant hormone, which makes its lethal toxicity specific to plants. Indeed, 2,4-D is not a poison, but classified as "harmful" (EU). Many substances regarded as poisons are toxic only indirectly, by toxication. An example is "wood alcohol" or methanol, which is not poisonous itself, but is chemically converted to toxic formaldehyde and formic acid in the liver. Many drug molecules are made toxic in the liver, and the genetic variability of certain liver enzymes makes the toxicity of many compounds differ between individuals. Exposure to radioactive substances can produce radiation poisoning, an unrelated phenomenon.
Document 5 (Title: Nick Drake): At the inquest in December, the coroner stated that the cause of death was "Acute amitriptyline poisoning—self-administered when suffering from a depressive illness", and concluded a verdict of suicide. Although the verdict has been disputed by some of his friends and members of his family,Brown, M., "Nick Drake: the fragile genius", The Daily Telegraph, 25 November 2014. there is a widely held view that, accidental or not, Drake had by then "given up on life". Rodney described his son's death as unexpected and extraordinary; however, in a 1979 interview he said he had been "worried about Nick being so depressed. We used to hide away the aspirin and pills and things like that."
