Document 1 (Title: Alice in Wonderland syndrome): Causes Because Alice in Wonderland syndrome is not commonly diagnosed and documented, it is difficult to estimate what the main causes are, if there are any. The cause of over half of the documented cases of Alice in Wonderland syndrome is unknown. Complete and partial forms of the Alice in Wonderland syndrome exist in a range of other disorders, including epilepsy, intoxicants, infectious states, fevers, and brain lesions. Furthermore, the syndrome is commonly associated with migraines, as well as the use of psychoactive drugs. It can also be the initial symptom of the Epstein–Barr virus (see mononucleosis), and a relationship between the syndrome and mononucleosis has been suggested. Within this suggested relationship, Epstein–Barr virus appears to be the most common cause in children, while for adults it is more commonly associated with migraines.
Document 2 (Title: Human betaherpesvirus 5): Immunocompetent adults CMV infections can still be of clinical significance in adult immunocompetent populations. CMV mononucleosis (some sources reserve "mononucleosis" for Epstein–Barr virus only). However, the mononucleosis syndrome associated with CMV typically lacks signs of enlarged cervical lymph nodes and splenomegaly. CMV has also been associated with Guillain–Barré syndrome, type 1 diabetes, and type 2 diabetes. The question of whether latent CMV infection has any negative effects on people who are otherwise healthy has been debated; as of 2016 the answer was not clear, but discussions had focused on whether latent CMV might increase the risk of some cardiovascular diseases and cancers. Pathogenesis
Document 3 (Title: Interleukin 15): Disease Epstein-Barr virus In humans with history of acute infectious mononucleosis (the syndrome associated with primary Epstein–Barr virus infection), IL-15R expressing lymphocytes are not detected even 14 years after infection. Celiac disease There have been recent studies suggesting that suppression of IL-15 may be a potential treatment for celiac disease and even presents the possibility of preventing its development. In one study with mice blocking IL-15 with an antibody led to the reversal of autoimmune intestinal damage. In another study mice used were able to eat gluten without developing symptoms. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease A recent report indicated IL-15 promotes non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Immunotherapy Metastatic cancer
Document 4 (Title: Infectious mononucleosis): Prognosis Serious complications are uncommon, occurring in less than 5% of cases: CNS complications include meningitis, encephalitis, hemiplegia, Guillain–Barré syndrome, and transverse myelitis. Prior infectious mononucleosis has been linked to the development of multiple sclerosis. Hematologic: Hemolytic anemia (direct Coombs test is positive) and various cytopenias, and bleeding (caused by thrombocytopenia) can occur. Mild jaundice Hepatitis with the Epstein–Barr virus is rare. Upper airway obstruction from tonsillar hypertrophy is rare. Fulminant disease course of immunocompromised people are rare. Splenic rupture is rare. Myocarditis and pericarditis are rare. Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome Chronic fatigue syndrome Cancers associated with the Epstein-Barr virus include: Burkitt's lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma and lymphomas in general as well as nasopharyngeal and gastric carcinoma. Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis
Document 5 (Title: Transfusion-associated cytomegalovirus mononucleosis.): Transfusion-associated cytomegalovirus mononucleosis is generally considered only as a complication of extracorporeal circulation following cardiac surgery. Three cases following trauma were recognized in less than one year. Both massive and limited volume blood transfusions were involved. Hectic fever was a characteristic feature in these otherwise remarkably asymptomatic individuals, without the classic features of heterophile-positive infectious mononucleosis. Since the illness developed several weeks into the post-operative period after extensive thoracic or abdominal trauma surgery, the presence of an undrained abscess was naturally the major diagnostic concern. Atypical lymphocytosis, markers of altered immunity (cold agglutinins, rheumatoid factor) and moderate hepatic dysfunction were important laboratory clues. In one case, focal isotope defects in the spleen scan misleadingly suggested a septic complication. A false-positive monospot test initially obscured the correct serologic diagnosis in the same patient. Failure to consider this selflimited viral infection may be a critical factor leading to unnecessary surgery. Other viral agents capable of eliciting a similar syndrome are cited.
