Document 1 (Title: Community-acquired pneumonia): Hospitalization Some CAP patients require intensive care, with clinical prediction rules such as the pneumonia severity index and CURB-65 guiding the decision whether or not to hospitalize. Factors increasing the need for hospitalization include: Age greater than 65 Underlying chronic illnesses Respiratory rate greater than 30 per minute Systolic blood pressure less than 90 mmHg Heart rate greater than 125 per minute Temperature below 35 or over 40 °C Confusion Evidence of infection outside the lung Laboratory results indicating hospitalization include: Arterial oxygen tension less than 60 mm Hg Carbon dioxide over 50 mmHg or pH under 7.35 while breathing room air Hematocrit under 30 percent Creatinine over 1.2 mg/dl or blood urea nitrogen over 20 mg/dl White-blood-cell count under 4 × 10^9/L or over 30 × 10^9/L Neutrophil count under 1 x 10^9/L
Document 2 (Title: Metabolic syndrome): IDF The International Diabetes Federation consensus worldwide definition of metabolic syndrome (2006) is: Central obesity (defined as waist circumference# with ethnicity-specific values) AND any two of the following: Raised triglycerides: > 150 mg/dL (1.7 mmol/L), or specific treatment for this lipid abnormality Reduced HDL cholesterol: < 40 mg/dL (1.03 mmol/L) in males, < 50 mg/dL (1.29 mmol/L) in females, or specific treatment for this lipid abnormality Raised blood pressure (BP): systolic BP > 130 or diastolic BP >85 mm Hg, or treatment of previously diagnosed hypertension Raised fasting plasma glucose (FPG): >100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L), or previously diagnosed type 2 diabetes If FPG is >5.6 mmol/L or 100 mg/dL, an oral glucose tolerance test is strongly recommended, but is not necessary to define presence of the syndrome. # If BMI is >30 kg/m2, central obesity can be assumed and waist circumference does not need to be measured
Document 3 (Title: Ranson criteria): Acute pancreatitis not secondary to gallstones At admission: Blood glucose > 11.11 mmol/L (> 200 mg/dL) Age > 55 years Serum LDH > 350 IU/L Serum AST > 250 IU/L WBC count > 16000 cells/mm3 Within 48 hours: Serum calcium < 2.0 mmol/L (< 8.0 mg/dL) Hematocrit decreased by > 10% Oxygen (hypoxemia with PaO2 < 60 mmHg) BUN increased by 1.8 or more mmol/L (5 or more mg/dL) after IV fluid hydration Base deficit (negative base excess) > 4 mEq/L Sequestration of fluids > 6 L Acute pancreatitis secondary to gallstones At admission: Glucose > 220 mg/dl Age > 70 years LDH > 400 IU/L AST > 250 IU/ 100 ml WBC count > 18000 cells/mm3 Within 48 hours: Serum calcium < 8 mg/dL Hematocrit decreased by > 10% Base deficit > 4 mEq/L BUN increased by > 2 mg/dL Sequestered fluid > 6L
Document 4 (Title: [Klebsiella pneumoniae meningitis associated with liver abscess: a case report].): We report a rare case of Klebsiella pneumoniae meningitis associated with liver abscess, which was successfully treated with cefotaxime (CTX), one of the third-generation cephalosporins. A 53-year-old man was admitted to Keio University Hospital on June 13, 1988, because of a fever and a headache. On June 3, he suddenly started shivering and his temperature rose to 39 degrees C. He then began to complain of polydipsia, polyuria, and a weight loss of 4 kg a week. On June 11, he developed a severe headache. Four years prior to this incident, he had been diagnosed as having diabetes after a routine medical examination, but had neglected to undergo medical treatment. On admission, laboratory data showed leukocytosis, hyperglycemia (394 mg/dl) and ketonuria (4+). A lumbar puncture yielded cloudy cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) containing 500/3 cells/mm8, of which about 70% were neutrophils. A diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis and purulent meningitis was made. A treatment with ampicillin (ABPC) and CTX, (12 g/day, each)...
Document 5 (Title: Toxic epidermal necrolysis): One point is given for each of the following factors: age >40 heart rate >120 beats/minute carrying diagnosis of cancer separation of epidermis on more than ten percent of body surface area (BSA) on day 1. Blood Urea Nitrogen >28 mg/dL Glucose >252 mg/dL (14 mmol/L) Bicarbonate <20mEq/L Score 0–1: 3.2% mortality 2: 12.2% mortality 3: 35.3% mortality 4: 58.3% mortality ≥5: 90% mortality Of note, this scoring system is most valuable when used on the first and third day of hospitalization, and it may underestimate mortality in patients with respiratory symptoms.

Question: A 4-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department by his parents. He is lethargic and confused and has a severe headache, vomiting, and a high-grade fever since earlier that day. His mother reports that the child was doing well until 2 days ago when he developed a fever and green nasal discharge. The patient has a history of neonatal sepsis, meningococcemia at 18 months of age, and pneumococcal pneumonia at 2 and 3 years of age. His scheduled vaccinations are up to date. His blood pressure is 70/50 mm Hg, heart rate is 120/min, respiratory rate is 22/min, and temperature is 39.3°C (102.4°F). On examination, the child is lethargic and his skin is pale, with several petechiae over his buttocks. There is a purulent nasal discharge from both nostrils. The lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Heart sounds are normal. There is marked neck rigidity. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows the following results: Opening pressure 100 mm H2O Appearance cloudy Protein 500 mg/dL (5 g/L) White blood cells 2500/μL (polymorphonuclear predominance) Protein 450 mg/dL (4.5 g/L) Glucose 31 mg/dL (1.7 mmol/L) Culture positive for N. meningitidis Which of the following immunological processes is most likely to be impaired in this child?
Options:
A. Production of IL-2 by Th1 cells
B. Activation of TCRs by MHC-II
C. Formation of C5-9 complex
D. Cleavage of C2 component of complement into C2a and C2b
