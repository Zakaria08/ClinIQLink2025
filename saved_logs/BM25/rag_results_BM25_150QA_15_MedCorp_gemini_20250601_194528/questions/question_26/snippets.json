        "content": "We describe the case of a 23 years old male, who suffered a 45 bullet wound in the arm and upper right hemithorax. He walked after his injury and 10 minutes later presented dizziness, cough and tachycardia. On admission a minor haemothorax was seen on a chest X ray, but the bullet was not seen. Even without symptoms, an X ray of abdomen showed the missile lying above the left sacroiliac joint. A chest tube was placed, the patient had an excellent recovery and was discharged a week later. After several months he presented hemoptysis and a moderate pain on his right chest and was treated as an acute bronchitis. Six months after his initial injury he developed a florid picture of acute pulmonary embolism (chest pain, dyspnea, hemoptysis, tachycardia, severe cough). A new chest X ray was done and the bullet was shown lying in the right chest. A pulmonary arteriography located it in a lower basal branch. Through a posterolateral thoracotomy the slug was obtained. The recovery was uneventful and he has remained well since. We discuss the possible mechanisms to explain the entrance of the bullet into the vascular system and conclude that in cases of gunshot wounds: a) An exit wound must be always searched for; if not found exploratory X ray are mandatory, b) If the bullet is not found, specially after thoracic injuries, bullet embolism should be contemplated, c) If there are signs of regional ischemia arteriography is mandatory.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

On physical exam, multiple, tender, non-erythematous subcutaneous nodules were noted along with a palpable, non-tender mass on the left side of the abdomen. CT abdomen showed a large heterogeneous mass measuring 20.1 by 10.7 by 18.1 cm, in the left quadrant of the abdomen along with a poorly defined low attenuation mass measuring 2.9 by 3 cm in the right hepatic lobe. CT guided biopsy of the left-sided abdominal mass was non-diagnostic. He underwent exploratory laparotomy, with excision of the left-sided abdominal mass along with splenectomy and distal pancreatectomy. There were multiple abnormal areas in the liver concerning for metastases. Pathology of the resected mass revealed sheets of malignant acinar cells with no intervening ductal structures or islets. Tumor cells were positive for trypsin and cytokeratin and were negative for CD117 and synaptophysin, consistent with pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma. Serum CA 19-9 levels were high. Lipase levels were elevated at 40,000U/dL. At this point, based on the biopsy and staging, the patient was diagnosed with stage IV pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma, but the cause of his polyarthralgia was still uncertain. Adjuvant chemotherapy was initiated with leucovorin, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and oxaliplatin for the carcinoma. During his treatment, his joint swelling and pain progressed and involved new joints of right ankle and left knee. Imaging studies of the joints showed joint effusion and soft tissue swelling. Arthrocentesis of the right ankle joint was performed, and the synovial fluid studies were consistent with infection and cultures were positive for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Pseudomonas. He was treated with antibiotics including vancomycin and piperacillin–tazobactam without any improvement. Due to progressive worsening of the right ankle joint, he required irrigation and debridement with arthrotomy. Repeat cultures were negative, but his symptoms continued to worsen, and he had persistent drainage of milky colored fluid from the surgical site and eventually required a below-knee amputation. Surgical pathology of the right knee joint revealed acute on chronic inflammation with the presence of granulation and fibrin tissue, without any evidence of malignancy. For further evaluation, arthrocentesis of left knee, left ankle, and right wrist was done and yielded milky colored fluid. His lipase levels continued to remain above 20,000 U/dL despite being treated with chemotherapy.",

The abduction of both eyes were full with terminal horizontal nystagmus. The adduction of both eyes were quite limited in each eye. He had a limited upward gaze with poor convergence.

        "content": "A 24-year-old white male with no known medical history presented to the hospital with chief complaints of 2 weeks of progressively worsening pain and swelling of his right wrist and left ankle joints. He did not report any fevers, chills, night sweats, weight loss or rash. He was employed as a fireman. He denied alcohol use disorder, smoking cigarettes, or any recreational drugs. Family history was significant for hypertension in father and ovarian cancer in the mother. His vital signs were within normal limits on presentation. On physical examination, the patient had significant swelling of multiple joints including the right wrist, right elbow, and left ankle. The joints were erythematous and tender to touch. Due to severe pain, he had limited range in the involved joints.",

        "title": "[A case of brain cysticerosis].",
        "content": "A 59-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with the history of epileptick attack of six years' duration. The seizure was associated with Jacksonian march starting in the right hand and then generalized. Todd's paresis of the right arm followed occasionally to the seizure. He was admitted to neurosurgical unit of other hospital in 1968 and 1971, but on each occasion no tumor or vascular abnormality was detected by extensive examiniations such as brain angiography, pneumoencephalography or brain scanning. He continued his hob as an engineer with anticonvulsant. He once lived in Manchuria in 1930s and had history of pulmonary tuberculosis. He was suffering from diabetes mellitus and chronic otitis media. Recentry he developed headache, forgetfulness, speech disturbance and right hemiparesis and was admitted to our department through psychiatric unit. On examination he was fully conscious but showed typical Gerstmann's syndrome and conduction aphasia. He also revealed bilateral choked disc, right hemiparesis, right hemihypesthesia and right homonymous hemianopsia. The cerebral angiograms and peneumoencephalogram suggested a left parietal cystic tumor. Brain scan with technetium 99m was negative. The spinal fluid was clear but showed slight pleocytosis (99/3/ml). Leucocyte count in the peripheral blood was 6600 per cubic meter with eosinophils of 3%. On craniotomy, small white patches were scattered at the subarachnoidal space suggesting of history of some meningitis. In the left parietooccipital region at Brodmann's area 19, a greyish yellow transparent cystic tumor was found in the subarachnoidal space which was confirmed to be one of the multilocular grape-like cystic tumors extending from area 19, gyrus angularis towards the arcuate fasciculus without continuity with the left lateral ventricle. Microscopic examination showed the racemosal type of cysticercus but no scolex was found. The fluid of the cysts was similar to the spinal fluid. He is totally symptome-free after five months' lapse from the operation except for sporadic spikes on the electroencephalogram. Although some neurosurgeons are against direct operation of the cerebral cysticercosis, we are sure it is possible to cure these patients suffering from chronic cysticercosis with tumor-like symptoms i.e. the tumor type of Stepien. But it is essential not to rupture the cysts during the operative procedure to avoid dissemination of worms which might lead to acute severe cerebral edema. Besides, echinococcus cysts harbouring many worms are often hardly differenciated macroscopically from the cysts of cysticercosis.",

        "content": "A 69-year-old man presented with a three-month history of otalgia and tenderness of the right ear and a one-week history of a painful right parotid swelling. Examination revealed granulation tissue in the right ear canal with normal looking tympanic membranes and a parotid abscess. Repeated biopsies from the ear canal and parotid showed non-specific inflammation. Repeated cultures from both areas grew Ps. aeruginosa. The patient's condition improved following three weeks of intensive treatment for malignant otitis externa only to relapse five weeks after the end of treatment. He received a second course, only to improve temporarily. He developed a right facial nerve palsy five weeks after he was first seen, followed four months later by palsies of all cranial nerves except the olfactory, before dying, seven months after his first appointment. The radiological, histological and post-mortem findings are discussed.",

        "content": "A 64-year-old male developed pain and marked swelling of his left calf muscle in September, 1989. Deep-vein thrombophlebitis was suspected, and therapy with warfarin sodium followed by urokinase was instituted. Because of unsatisfactory effect of the therapy, the patient was referred to another hospital on January 3rd 1990. A CT scan of the left leg showed a soft-tissue mass adjacent to the fibula. A biopsy of the mass revealed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of diffuse medium-sized cell type. Immunohistologic examination confirmed B cell type. He was admitted to our hospital on January 31st 1990. A chest roentgenogram showed right pleural effusion. A CT scan of the abdomen revealed a space-occupying lesion in the liver. A Gallium scintigraphy showed markedly increased isotope uptake in the left calf and liver. He was classed as a Stage IV B. He responded well to combination chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, THP-adriamycin, VP-16, and prednisolone and achieved a complete remission. Although prominent infiltration of lymphoma cells in skeletal muscles is rarely reported, it is important to perform the biopsy promptly when the mass is found in a muscle. In this case report, we describe a rare case of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma with muscle invasion presented as marked calf muscle swelling.",

        "content": "A 73-year-old man was admitted with gait disturbance and dysarthria. He showed right-side cerebellar ataxia. Computed tomography of brain showed left thalamic bleeding. Nine months later, he was admitted again because of seizure and consciousness disturbance. He had a history of diabetes mellitus and gout for five years, but no hypertension. On physical examination the lungs and heart were normal. On neurological examination, he showed stupor,pupils and eye position were normal. He showed right hemiparesis and urinary incontinence. The deep tendon reflexes were (+) at the upper limbs and (2+) at the right knee and ankle. Blood pressure was 162/88 mmHg and glucose was 275 mg/dl. Other laboratory data were normal. Brain CT showed hemorrhage of the left frontal lobe. The cystatin C level in cerebrospinal fluid was 68 ng/ml. Therefore we suspected cystatin C deposit amyloid angiopathy. In this case, thalamic hemorrhage was initially thought to be amyloid angiopathy. In cases of cerebral hemorrhage in the elderly without hypertension, we must be considered amyloid angiopathy.",
