Document 1 (Title: Aquagenic urticaria): The hives associated with aquagenic urticaria are typically small (approximately 1–3 mm), red- or skin-colored welts (called wheals) with clearly defined edges. It most commonly develops on the neck, upper trunk and arms, although it can occur anywhere on the body. Once the water source is removed, the rash generally fades within 30 to 60 minutes. Water in all forms, such as tap or sea water, swimming pool water, sweat, tears, and saliva can induce the lesions. Cause The cause of aquagenic urticaria is not fully understood; however, several mechanisms have been proposed. Interaction between water and a component in or on the skin or sebum has been suggested. This theory suggests that a substance is formed by this interaction, the absorption of which causes perifollicular mast cell degranulation with release of histamine.
Document 2 (Title: Hives): Cholinergic or stress Cholinergic urticaria (CU) is one of the physical urticaria which is provoked during sweating events such as exercise, bathing, staying in a heated environment, or emotional stress. The hives produced are typically smaller than classic hives and are generally shorter-lasting. Multiple subtypes have been elucidated, each of which require distinct treatment. Cold-induced
Document 3 (Title: Hives): Water-induced This type of urticaria is also termed rare and occurs upon contact with water. The response is not temperature-dependent and the skin appears similar to the cholinergic form of the disease. The appearance of hives is within one to 15 minutes of contact with the water and can last from 10 minutes to two hours. This kind of hives does not seem to be stimulated by histamine discharge like the other physical hives. Most researchers believe this condition is actually skin sensitivity to additives in the water, such as chlorine. Water urticaria is diagnosed by dabbing tap water and distilled water to the skin and observing the gradual response. Aquagenic urticaria is treated with capsaicin (Zostrix) administered to the chafed skin. This is the same treatment used for shingles. Antihistamines are of questionable benefit in this instance since histamine is not the causative factor.
Document 4 (Title: Cold urticaria): Cold urticaria (essentially meaning cold hives) is a disorder where hives (urticaria) or large red welts form on the skin after exposure to a cold stimulus. The welts are usually itchy and often the hands and feet will become itchy and swollen as well. Hives vary in size from about in diameter to as big as about or larger. This disorder, or perhaps two disorders with the same clinical manifestations, can be inherited (familial cold urticaria) or acquired (primary acquired cold urticaria). The acquired form is most likely to occur between ages 18–25, although it can occur as early as 5 years old in some cases. Life-threatening risks include suffocation resulting from pharyngeal angioedema induced by cold foods or beverages, drowning after shock from swimming in cold water and anaphylactic shock. Types Cold urticaria may be divided into the following types:
Document 5 (Title: Aquagenic urticaria): Once known as a separate, rare disease, aquagenic urticaria is now considered a subtype of general urticaria. The first case was reported by Walter B Shelley et al. in 1964. The condition is more common in women than men, and typically presents for the first time during puberty. Genetics may play a part, and the condition may be related to other sensitivities such as lactose intolerance. Prevention Desensitization does not seem to work for aquagenic urticaria; a patient will continue to react to water no matter how gradually or frequently it is introduced. Topical application of antihistamines like 1% diphenhydramine before water exposure is reported to reduce the hives. Oil in water emulsion creams, or petrolatum, applied as barrier agents prior to a shower or bath may control symptoms. Therapeutic effectiveness of various classes of drugs differs from case to case.
