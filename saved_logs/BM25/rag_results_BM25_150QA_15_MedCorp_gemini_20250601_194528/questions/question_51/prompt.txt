Document 1 (Title: Programmed cell death): Basic morphological and biochemical features of PCD have been conserved in both plant and animal kingdoms. Specific types of plant cells carry out unique cell-death programs. These have common features with animal apoptosis—for instance, nuclear DNA degradation—but they also have their own peculiarities, such as nuclear degradation triggered by the collapse of the vacuole in tracheary elements of the xylem. Janneke Balk and Christopher J. Leaver, of the Department of Plant Sciences, University of Oxford, carried out research on mutations in the mitochondrial genome of sun-flower cells. Results of this research suggest that mitochondria play the same key role in vascular plant PCD as in other eukaryotic cells.
Document 2 (Title: Topoisomerase): Topoisomerase is also found in the mitochondria of cells. The mitochondria generate ATP as well as playing a role in programmed cell death and aging. The mitochondrial DNA of animal cells is a circular, double-stranded DNA that requires the activity of topoisomerase to be replicated. The classes of topoisomerase found in the mitochondria are I, IIβ, IIIα.
Document 3 (Title: Jasmonate): Following its role in defense, JAs have also been implicated in cell death and leaf senescence. JA can interact with many kinases and transcription factors associated with senescence. JA can also induce mitochondrial death by inducing the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROSs). These compounds disrupt mitochondria membranes and compromise the cell by causing apoptosis, or programmed cell death. JAs' roles in these processes are suggestive of methods by which the plant defends itself against biotic challenges and limits the spread of infections.
Document 4 (Title: Programmed cell death): Mitochondriate eukaryotic cells live poised between life and death, because mitochondria still retain their repertoire of molecules that can trigger cell suicide. It is not clear why apoptotic machinery is maintained in the extant unicellular organisms. This process has now been evolved to happen only when programmed. to cells (such as feedback from neighbors, stress or DNA damage), mitochondria release caspase activators that trigger the cell-death-inducing biochemical cascade. As such, the cell suicide mechanism is now crucial to all of our lives. Programmed death of entire organisms Clinical significance ABL The BCR-ABL oncogene has been found to be involved in the development of cancer in humans. c-Myc c-Myc is involved in the regulation of apoptosis via its role in downregulating the Bcl-2 gene. Its role the disordered growth of tissue. Metastasis A molecular characteristic of metastatic cells is their altered expression of several apoptotic genes. See also
Document 5 (Title: Mitochondrion): Additional functions Mitochondria play a central role in many other metabolic tasks, such as: Signaling through mitochondrial reactive oxygen species Regulation of the membrane potential Apoptosis-programmed cell death Calcium signaling (including calcium-evoked apoptosis) Regulation of cellular metabolism Certain heme synthesis reactions (see also: porphyrin) Steroid synthesis. Hormonal signaling Mitochondria are sensitive and responsive to hormones, in part by the action of mitochondrial estrogen receptors (mtERs). These receptors have been found in various tissues and cell types, including brain and heart Immune signaling Neuronal mitochondria also contribute to cellular quality control by reporting neuronal status towards microglia through specialised somatic-junctions.
