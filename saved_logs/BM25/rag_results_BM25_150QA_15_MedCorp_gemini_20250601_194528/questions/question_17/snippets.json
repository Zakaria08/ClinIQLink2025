A 53-year-old man was admitted to our hospital for further examination of the abnormal shadows on chest X-ray film. Six months before admission, he was admitted to another hospital because of alcoholic liver disease and diabetes mellitus. Since the initial chest film showed cavities with infiltration in the left upper lung field, he was treated with antituberculous drugs despite negative sputum cultures for mycobacterium. In spite of the medication, his chest X-ray film revealed another cavitary lesion, so he was referred to our hospital. He had been asymptomatic during this period. Chest X-ray on admission disclosed multiple cavities in the left upper lobe and a cavity in the right lower lobe. Repeated sputum specimens, bronchial washings and brushings for cytology and cultures were all negative. In an attempt to clarify the pathogen, percutaneous lung aspiration (PLA) was performed. The PLA sample yielded a positive culture of Sporothrix shenckii. After the diagnosis, S. schenckii was also cultured from sputa. A sporothrix skin test and yeast agglutination test for S. schenckii were positive. In the absence of a history for skin lesion, the patient was diagnosed as a primary pulmonary sporotrichosis. As iodide therapy was ineffective, he was started on a regimen of intravenous amphotericin B. However his renal function progressively deteriorated, so amphotericin B was discontinued. Now he receives miconazole intravenously and is still under careful observation. As far as we know, this is the first report of primary pulmonary sporotrichosis in Japan.

At the end are weighed the benefits for Mendel (as charged by Sir Ronald Fisher) to have documented his results on hand of falsified data. Mendel was born into a humble farm family in the \"Kuhländchen\", then a predominantly German area of Northern Moravia. On the basis of great gifts Mendel was able to begin higher studies; however, he found himself in serious financial difficulties because of his father's accident and incapacitation. His hardships engendered illness which threatened continuation and completion of his studies until he was afforded the chance of absolving successfully theological studies as an Augustinian monk in the famous chapter of St. Thomas in Altbrünn (Staré Brno). Psychosomatic indisposition made Mendel unfit for practical pastoral duties. Thus, he was directed to teach but without appropriate state certification; an attempt to pass such an examination failed. At that point he was sent to the University of Vienna for a 2-year course of studies, with emphasis on physics and botany, to prepare him for the exam. His scientific and methodologic training enabled him to plan studies of the laws of inheritance, which had begun to interest him already during his theology training, and to choose the appropriate experimental plant. In 1865, after 12 years of systematic investigations on peas, he presented his results in the famous paper \"Versuche über Pflanzenhybriden.\" Three years after his return from Vienna he failed to attain his teaching certification a second time. Only by virtue of his exceptional qualifications did he continue to function as a Supplementary Professor of Physics and Natural History in the two lowest classes of a secondary school. In 1868 he was elected Abbot of his chapter, and freed from teaching duties, was able to pursue his many scientific interests with greater efficiency. This included meteorology, the measurement of ground water levels, further hybridization in plants (a.o. involving the hawk week Hieracium up to about 1873), vegetable and fruit tree horticulture, apiculture, and agriculture in general. This involved Mendel's active participation in many organizations interested in advancing these fields at a time when appropriate research institutes did not exist in Brünn.

After 3 days of the treatment with NETPV, a marked improvement was noted and the patient was discharged from the ICU. NETPV has the benefits as follows.

During NETPV, his respiratory rate and oxygen consumption were decreased and Pao2 was increased compared with his spontaneous breathing. He made a recovery from dyspnea, especially, he was able to take a deep breath. When NETPV was applied to him, pulmonary artery and arterial catheterizations revealed that central venous pressure was slightly decreased, cardiac index unchanged or slightly decreased, heart rate, systemic blood pressure, and pulmonary arterial pressure unchanged compared with spontaneous breathing. The patient was able to read books and maintained communication in his voice with his family and the medical staff. After 3 days of the treatment with NETPV, a marked improvement was noted and the patient was discharged from the ICU. NETPV has the benefits as follows. First, it is very easy for both a patient and a doctor to assist his breathing because an endotracheal intubation is not necessary.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "content": "A 62-year-old man with a 20-year history of excessive daytime somnolence and kicking during sleep was an obligate carrier of the restless legs syndrome gene because his paternal grandfather, father, and all three of his children had symptoms of restless legs syndrome. The patient himself, however, denied motor restlessness after a careful and exhaustive medical history and he was originally believed to have periodic movements in sleep without restless legs. Close clinical observation did reveal nighttime motor restlessness, although the patient continued to deny its importance. Polysomnography showed frequent periodic movements in sleep. We conclude that there can be variable expressivity of the clinical features in familial restless legs syndrome and that there are probably some relatively nonrestless patients with prominent periodic movements in sleep who are carriers of the restless legs syndrome gene. Some sleep-disordered patients who are believed to have only periodic movements in sleep may have a forme fruste of autosomal dominant restless legs syndrome. If one does not examine these patients carefully at night and take an adequate family history, one may miss the diagnosis of restless legs syndrome.",

        "content": "A 72-year-old man, 154 cm tall, weighing 53 kg was suffering from severe herpetic neuralgia on his left 10th intercostal nerve area. His pain continued even he was treated with frequent epidural nerve block (4 to 5 times per week) by an anesthesiologist. He was referred to our hospital on his 105th pain day. He complained severe continuous pain and numbness on his left 10th intercostal nerve area. Touching the painful skin induced lightning pain. His pain was so severe that his sleeping was disturbed and also he could not maintain his usual life. Epidural nerve block at 10th thoracic nerve was done with 20mg methylprednisolone acetate and 5ml of 1% lidocaine. After the treatment, his pain was reduced to 3/10 of the one he had on admission, and also his sleep was not disturbed further. Epidural nerve blocks with methylprednisolone weekly for a month induced no more remission. At his 154th pain day, a dose of 20mg methyl prednisolone acetate and 1% lidocaine 5ml was given intrathecally through 2nd lumber intervertebral space. The pain was relieved completely after the block. And he complained nothing about the skin area which had been disturbing his life for a long time. Auditory brainstem response which was recorded during the block showed prolongation of the latency of phase III and phase V at 40 minutes after the intrathecal injection of lidocaine.",
