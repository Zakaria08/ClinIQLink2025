Administration of graded concentrations of dopamine (5 X 10(-8) M to 10(-3) M) to interrenal slices induced a dose-dependent inhibition of steroid secretion. The half-maximal effective dose of dopamine was 7 X 10(-6) M for corticosterone and 4 X 10(-6) M for aldosterone. Noradrenaline and adrenaline were also able to elicit a dose-related inhibition of steroid release, but these catecholamines were approximately 100 and 2000 times less potent than dopamine in our model. Administration of repeated pulses of dopamine (5 X 10(-5) M), at 150-min intervals, led to a reproducible inhibition of corticosteroid secretion without any desensitization phenomenon. Similarly, prolonged infusion of dopamine (5 X 10(-6) M) caused a sustained inhibition of steroidogenesis. The inhibitory action of dopamine was also observed using enzymatically dispersed adrenal cells, indicating that dopamine exerts a direct effect on adrenocortical cells. After the second pulse, dopamine also induced a transient stimulation of steroid secretion from acutely dispersed cells. Administration of short pulses of apomorphine (5 X 10(-5) M) induced a transient inhibition of corticosteroid secretion, and the kinetics of the response were very similar to that observed with dopamine. During prolonged administration of dopamine, the steroidogenic actions of ACTH (10(-9) M) and serotonin (5 X 10(-6) M) were not altered. In contrast, dopamine induced a marked inhibition of angiotensin II-evoked corticosteroid secretion. Taken together, these results show that the neurotransmitter dopamine exerts a direct inhibitory effect on steroid secretion from frog adrenocortical cells. Our results also indicate that dopamine and angiotensin II likely act through a common intracellular pathway. These data suggest that dopamine, released by chromaffin cells during neurogenic stress, may modulate the response of adrenocortical cells through a paracrine mode of communication.",

The net effect of these drugs is to reduce sodium and water retention but increase retention of potassium. In other words, these drugs stimulate the excretion of sodium and water in urine, while they block the excretion of potassium. Another example is spironolactone, a potassium-sparing diuretic of the steroidal spirolactone group, which interferes with the aldosterone receptor (among others) leading to lower blood pressure by the mechanism described above. Aldosterone was first isolated by Simpson and Tait in 1953.",
