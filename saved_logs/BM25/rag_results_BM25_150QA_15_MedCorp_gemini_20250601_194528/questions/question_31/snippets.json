        "content": "A case report has been published in the literature describing attempted suicide with various medications. However, the overdose manifestations were more suggestive of pramipexole toxicity than that of other drugs. A 59-year-old male was brought to the hospital 5 hours after ingesting 3 mg pramipexole, 2250 mg venlafaxine SR, and 360 mg mirtazapine. His vitals were stable, and his neurological examination, including muscle tone and power, was normal. He was mildly agitated and had visual hallucinations. Nine hours later, he developed severe myoclonus to the extent he feared falling from bed. He consistently reported spiders crawling in the room and an alien man sitting on a chair next to him. He had some degree of urinary retention, was jittery and hypervigilant, and could not move due to postural dizziness. His routine blood reports were normal, with mild elevation in lactate. The serum concentration of pramipexole was significantly elevated at 34.2 ng/ml, around five times the upper limit of the therapeutic range. It decreased progressively, and the patient was then discharged after his symptoms subsided.",

Because threats and assault are in fact against the law, a man who physically or sexually assaults his wife or girlfriend couldn't keep doing it without this support from the very people who are supposed to enforce the law and help the victims of crime-namely, police, prosecutors, judges, clergy, psychologists, social workers and doctors. Some let him get away with it, look the other way, or--unsure of what to do to stop it--do nothing at all. Thus, they reinforce his \"right\" to use force, even if they never say, \"Go ahead, hit her.\" The police officer who walks a man around the block or fails to show up when called, the clergyman who advises a woman to go home and pray, the doctor who gently patches her injuries but avoids asking who inflicted them, all cooperate with the abusive man in several ways. He comes to understand that no one will stop him from doing what he does. He learns that there are no consequences to his actions--even his violent actions. He can beat up \"his woman\" if he wants to and get away with it.",

By the age of 53, after one year without therapy, his neurological status has worse. DP was reinstituted but some weeks later his renal laboratory parameters became severely affected. DP was discontinued and zinc sulfate (220 mg three times daily) was introduced. On this therapeutic regimen his renal laboratory parameters returned to previous level after one month. Within one year on this therapeutic regimen neurological manifestations were resolved. After 31 months on zinc treatment he remains neurologically asymptomatic and his renal function is satisfactory.

Analysis demonstrated an underlying splitting between his experiencing and observing ego. His analyst received a projection of his observing ego, the part that was worried about his drinking. Because this split was resolved within a therapeutic alliance, Mr. A. decided that he had been attacking and punishing himself with alcohol, and he elected to abstain from alcohol entirely. The first key event that lead up to this dramatic decision was a sense that his analyst was a separate person. The second, arriving for discussion within the analysis through a dream, was his conviction that he would have to choose either to continue to drink with loss of control at the cost of his analysis or that he would have to choose to continue analysis at the expense of having to stop drinking. Mr. A. then came to feel that his analyst was attacking and punishing him with a fee increase. After 15 months of complete abstinence, Mr. A. found that he could drink with rare symptoms, but he still felt saddled with an abusive analyst. Mr. A.'s rages about the fee came up most commonly right after weekend or vacation breaks in the analysis.

Negative extra-thoracic pressure ventilation (NETPV) was maintained at a IMV rate of 30 breath/min, peak negative extra-thoracic pressure of -20 to -30 cmH2O, and an inspiratory/expiratory ratio of 1:2. During NETPV, his respiratory rate and oxygen consumption were decreased and Pao2 was increased compared with his spontaneous breathing. He made a recovery from dyspnea, especially, he was able to take a deep breath. When NETPV was applied to him, pulmonary artery and arterial catheterizations revealed that central venous pressure was slightly decreased, cardiac index unchanged or slightly decreased, heart rate, systemic blood pressure, and pulmonary arterial pressure unchanged compared with spontaneous breathing. The patient was able to read books and maintained communication in his voice with his family and the medical staff. After 3 days of the treatment with NETPV, a marked improvement was noted and the patient was discharged from the ICU. NETPV has the benefits as follows. First, it is very easy for both a patient and a doctor to assist his breathing because an endotracheal intubation is not necessary.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "content": "Cases involving two patients who presented post-traumatic prolonged disturbance of consciousness (PTPDC), namely akinetic mutism, and recovered from it after treatment with trihexyphenidyl were reported. Case 1: A seventy-one-year-old farmer. Five months after head injury, when he was first admitted to us, he was stable with signs of oligokinesia, katatonic posture, speechlessness, rigid muscle tones and positive cog-wheel phenomenon. One week after administration of the drug, his speech and voluntary movement improved remarkably. Two months after the treatment, he was able to walk, and was discharged from the hospital. Case 2: A forty-six-year-old man sustained major head trauma. In the acute stage, he was comatose with decerebrate posture. On the 15th hospital day, he showed a state of akinetic mutism with normal sleep - wakefulness cycle. Evacuation of the collected subdural fluid was done one month after the injury, which resulted in no change in his clinical state. Five months after the injury, trihexyphenidyl treatment was begun. A few days after the treatment, his motor activity and his facial expression obviously improved. One week after, he mimicked the word 'o-ha-yo (good morning)' after the physician's greeting. CT scan and magnetic resonance imaging in the chronic state of these patients showed bifrontal cerebral white matter lesions, which indicated old cerebral contusion. No brain stem lesions were detected with these examinations. Our two cases clearly did not belong to the category of post-traumatic parkinsonism because of their clinical courses, and their features shown in radiological examinations. However the anti-parkinsonian drug, trihexyphenidyl was effective.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "content": "The cancer patient should not be treated differently from other patients. He has the right to good medical care and, especially, sympathetic and constructive psychologic support during all phases of diagnosis, surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, independent of disease extent or therapeutic response. After the physician has reevaluated his own concepts about cancer and death, he can effectively begin to treat and support his cancer patients. By understanding the individual psychologic problems of cancer patients and their families, a physician can develop an effective psychologic, as well as antineoplastic, treatment program. The family physician has the central role of introducing the cancer patient to his illness and to his oncologic physicians. The surgeon should discuss preoperatively the nature of a patient's problem and the proposed surgical treatment with its possible alterations of bodily function. Postoperatively, he and the family physician should develop a treatment program after appropriate consultation with oncologic subspecialists. If the radiotherapist is consulted and feels radiation therapy is indicated, he should outline his objectives and the possible side effects of therapy. Likewise, the medical oncologist should discuss the potential benefits and possible side effects of anticancer drugs if he feels they should be administered. No one way of supporting the cancer patient is superior. Each patient and his doctors have to develop individual relationships based on honesty, trust, and close communication. A continued commitment to the care of the patient with nurturing of hope and realistic goals is necessary, even when all antineoplastic treatment plans have failed. A satisfactory adjustment of the patient, his family, and the physician as he approaches death can be a natural and beneficial outgrowth of the doctor-patient relationship. Although much attention has been recently focused on the problems of the terminal patient, it is also important to realize that even cured cancer patients may need active psychologic support long after successful antineoplastic therapy has been terminated.",
