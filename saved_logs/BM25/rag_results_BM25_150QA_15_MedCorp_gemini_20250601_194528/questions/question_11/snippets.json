Visual acuity of her right eye had been lost almost completely due to the previous ocular injury. Ophthalmological examination revealed left conjunctival injection, slight ipsilateral proptosis but pulsation of eye ball, chemosis and bruit were not so obvious. She had a visual acuity of 1.2 on her left eye. Left intraocular pressure was 30 mmHg while right was normal. Left CAG revealed a left carotid-cavernous fistula with anterior, posterior, inferior venous drainage. Temporal craniotomy was done and copper needles were inserted into the posterior part of Parkinson's triangle. An angiogram after operation demonstrated the persistency of the anterior and posterior venous drainage. 6 weeks later, electrothrombosis of left superior ophthalmic vein was carried out. After that, carotid-cavernous fistula disappeared perfectly. Important points of the surgical technique are; 1) to apply a silverclip to the tentorial edge just posterior to the third nerve, than anatomical realtionship of internal carotid artery, cavernous sinus and the clip applied are carefully investigated on the subsequent angiograms. 2) to repeat angiography several titate of embolization of cavernous sinus should often be checked.",

In general, most ocular causes for pain also cause the eye to be red, thus alerting the examiner to the focality of the problem.

Ocular signs and symptoms also occur with numerous other causes of headache. Double vision in association with periocular pain can result from orbital lesions, isolated cranial neuropathies, and cavernous sinus lesions. Pupillary abnormalities like Horner's syndrome may result from a variety of painful conditions, including cluster headache, parasellar neoplasms or aneurysms, internal carotid dissection or occlusion, and Tolosa-Hunt syndrome. Pain with a dilated and unreactive pupil may reflect a benign condition like Adie's syndrome or ophthalmoplegic migraine, or it may herald the presence of a life-threatening posterior communicating artery aneurysm. Headache and transient visual loss can be manifestations of classic migraine, or be symptoms of ocular hypoperfusion from ipsilateral internal carotid occlusion or increased intracranial pressure from pseudotumor cerebri.

The signs and symptoms of Graves' disease virtually all result from the direct and indirect effects of hyperthyroidism, with main exceptions being Graves' ophthalmopathy, goiter, and pretibial myxedema (which are caused by the autoimmune processes of the disease). Symptoms of the resultant hyperthyroidism are mainly insomnia, hand tremor, hyperactivity, hair loss, excessive sweating, oligomenorrhea, itching, heat intolerance, weight loss despite increased appetite, diarrhea, frequent defecation, palpitations, periodic partial muscle weakness or paralysis in those especially of Asian descent, and skin warmth and moistness. Further signs that may be seen on physical examination are most commonly a diffusely enlarged (usually symmetric), nontender thyroid, lid lag, excessive lacrimation due to Graves' ophthalmopathy, arrhythmias of the heart, such as sinus tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, and premature ventricular contractions, and hypertension. People with hyperthyroidism may",

        "content": "A 36-year-old man was admitted to the outpatient clinic at the Goundi Missionary Hospital in the south of Chad in May 2001. He complained of visual impairment in the left eye, ocular and abdominal pruritus, and abdominal pain. He had previously been treated with DEC for M. perstans infection five months prior to his visit. A blood sample was taken at 11:00 am, and examined microscopically as a thick blood film stained with Giemsa's solution. The thick blood film revealed the presence of M. perstans, and no other parasites were found. He had 3% eosinophilia. A visual acuity test showed a reduction of visual acuity to 4/10 for the left eye, while the right eye was 9/10. However, no abnormalities were observed during examination of the anterior left eye chamber. Upon examination of the fundus of his left eye, a narrow, white, motionless, and linear lesion of 6–7 mm was found. He was then treated with a second course of DEC (400 mg daily in two doses for eight days, after a",

        "content": "We report a patient with idiopathic hypoparathyroidism associated with unilateral calcification of the basal ganglia and contralateral choreic movements. A 66-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital because of involuntary movements of the left limbs. Two years before the present admission, she had operations for bilateral cataracts. Eight months before admission, she had an onset of severe carpal spasms and pain in both arms and legs. These symptoms improved after one month's rest in a hospital. About a month before admission, she noted progressive difficulty in using her left hand, followed by difficulty in walking due to the abnormal involuntary movement of the left lower limb. Two weeks before admission her carpal spasms appeared again, bilaterally. On admission, she was alert. The general physical examination was normal. Neurological examination revealed choreic movements in the left hand, arm, leg and neck, and grimacing of the left face. She also complained of the spasms and pain in her hands, dysarthria and shortness of the breath. Chvostek and Trousseau signs were positive. Laboratory examination revealed marked decrease in serum calcium level (2.57 mEq/ml) and increase in inorganic phosphorus level (6.40 mEq/ml). Serum level of parathyroid hormone was less than 10 pg/ml. Ellthworth-Howard test was positive, in that the infusion of parathyroid hormone (100 u) elicited a marked increment of the urinary excretions of phosphorus and cAMP. X-ray examination of the spine revealed ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament in the cervical region. CT-scans of the brain revealed calcification in the region of right globus pallidus and putamen.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
