Male gonadal development For males, the testes form at six fetal weeks and the sertoli cells begin developing by the eight week of gestation. SRY, the sex-determining locus, serves to differentiate the Sertoli cells. The Sertoli cells are the point of origin for anti-Müllerian hormone. Once synthesized, the anti-Müllerian hormone initiates the ipsilateral regression of the Müllerian tract and inhibits the development of female internal features. At 10 weeks of gestation, the Leydig cells begin to produce androgen hormones. The androgen hormone dihydrotestosterone is responsible for the development of the male external genitalia.",

        "content": "A 27 year-old female in 39th week gestation with schizophrenia underwent an emergency Cesarean section using general anesthesia. A diagnosis of schizophrenia was made two years previously, since then oral anti-psychotic drugs such as chlorpromazine had been given to her. In June 1989 she suddenly became excited and generalized muscle rigidity was observed without any triggering episodes. Her excitement was so marked that we had to administer intramuscular levomepromazine 75 mg and diazepam 10 mg to her, but they failed to sedate her adequately. Emergency Cesarean section was scheduled to overcome this situation. Spinal or epidural anesthesia was not indicated because of her vigorous excitement, and anesthesia was induced with thiopental 350 mg and succinylcholine 40 mg. Induction-delivery time was 12 minutes. Pentazocine 30 mg in combination with nitrous oxide was given for the maintenance of anesthesia. Plasma levomepromazine levels were 46.9 ng.ml-1 in the mother and 11.3 ng.ml-1 in the umbilical vein, respectively. The baby's Apgar score was 9 and 1 min and 9 at 5 min after the delivery. The baby developed slight generalized tremor until next day, probably due to effect of levomepromazine given before the Cesarean section. The patient was discharged without any cardiorespiratory trouble and her baby has been doing well so far.",

The patient's menstrual periods had been regular since menarche at the age of 12 until she became amenorrheic at the age of 20. She visited our facility in November 1988 after receiving three cycles of estrogen and gestagen replacement therapy from a previous physician which caused withdrawal bleeding. Clomiphen citrate reportedly failed to induce apparent ovulation. On her first visit with us, she was 160 cm tall weighing 47 kg with apparent hoarseness but not with hirsutism. Pelvic examination revealed significant clitoromegaly but otherwise normal external and internal genitalia. Laparoscopic examination disclosed that her uterus appeared to be normal with bilateral ovaries relatively small (4 x 4 x 3 cm) without tumorous or polycystic appearance. Histological examination of her ovaries obtained at laparoscopy showed several primary follicles with mild infiltration of the stromal cells. No thickened tunica albuginea or cystic formation were observed. These findings did not support either polycystic ovary or hyperthecosis. Serum testosterone (T) levels were extremely high (7.1 ng/ml), while serum androstenedione levels were only slightly above normal range (3.1 ng/ml). Urine 17-KS excretion was slightly increased (6.1 mg/day), while 17-OHCS output was within normal range (4.0 mg/day). Basal serum LH and FSH levels were within normal range and LH pulse frequency was reduced to 1 in 4 hours. Administration of dexamethasone 1 mg/day for 2 days did not suppress circulating T and free T levels but lowered serum cortisol concentration and urine excretion of 17-OHCS. Blood glucose and insulin levels were within normal limits and their responses to oral glucose administration were normal. Abdominal and pelvic ultrasonography and computed tomography as well as adrenal scintigraphy did not reveal any tumorous lesions in bilateral adrenals and ovaries. Administration of GnRH agonist, Buserelin 900 micrograms/day, suppressed circulating T concentrations to 0.7 ng/ml in 8 days, while it had no significant effects on DHEA and DHEA-S levels. After 16 weeks of Buserelin administration, ovulation was successfully induced by hMG administration. Cyclic estrogen and gestagen replacement therapy by Kaufmann's schedule for 2 cycles also suppressed serum T levels to normal, female range. Thus, the present case represents non-neoplastic, non-PCO, ovarian hypertestosteronism which responded well both to GnRH agonist and estrogen and gestagen replacement therapy in terms of lowering circulating T levels.",

In the present study the results obtained in vigorous and mildly depressed newborns, by the continuous recording of fetal heart rate during labor and of neonatal heart rate during 90 minutes after birth, are presented. Twenty three pregnant women were studied during labor, as well as their newborns. They fulfilled the following conditions: --Mothers without known complications and good prenatal care. --Term pregnancies with single fetuses in vertex presentation with birthweight normal for age. --All labors started, progressed and delivered spontanously withoug signs of fetal distress. No drugs were given to the mother during labor or to the neonate. The umbilical cord was clamped immediately after birth. Seventeen neonates were vigorous at 1 and 5 minutes (Apgar score 7 or higher). Six neonates were slightly depressed at the first minute but all of them recovered at 5 minutes. Both groups are studied separately. Figure 1 shows the average values of BFHR and NHR corresponding to 17 vigorous newborns (Apgar scores 7-10 at the first and fifth minutes of life). No major variations were found in the average values of BFHR in the time period studied. No statistically significant differences were found in the BFHR of the same fetus at 60, 30 and 8 minutes before delivery (Fig. 2). A decrease in BFHR occurred during the 6 minutes preceding birth (fig. 1). After birth the average values of NHR were higher than the fetal ones (Fig. 1). This post-natal increase in heart rate (32 beats/min) is statistically significant when BFHR values 30 minutes before delivery are compared with NHR values recorded 10 minutes after birth (Fig. 3). After this initial increase, NHR starts a gradual fall, lasting about 50 minutes and then becomes stable at a level similar to that of fetal heart rate (Fig. 1). Figure 1 shows that puncture of the heel causes an increase in NHR. The difference between NHR before and after the puncture is significant (Fig. 6).

        "content": "From a population of 2,774 high-risk patients monitored during labor, 1,304 single pregnancies in cephalic presentation and with direct monitoring for at least 1 hour before completion or cesarean-section were studied. The maternal and fetal clinical data and the tracings were hand reviewed, coded, and programmed for computer analysis. In the record were studied baseline, its changes (tachycardia, fixed, saltatory), the accelerations, and the decelerations (early, variable, late). Fifty-four per cent had some type of FHR deceleration. Accelerations were recorded in over 12 per cent of all cases and were associated with cord problems in 41 per cent. Subgrouping the patients by age of gestation (less than or equal to 36 weeks, 37 to 41 weeks, and greater than or equal to 42 weeks) revealed a 10 per cent prolonged gestation rate and only 6.8 per cent premature; these had a lower 5 minute Apgar score. Fetal weight and age were positively correlated with Apgar score. Baseline changes were much frequent among pre- and postmature infants, particularly tachycardia in the latter (40 per cent). The premature infants had a 25 per cent incidence of fetal distress and the postmature infants had 20 per cent. Neonatal morbidity and mortality rates were very high among premature infants and a mortality rate of 2.3 per cent was found among postmature infants. Saltatory pattern and particularly fixed baseline seem characteristic of prolonged gestation and placental insufficiency. With tachycardia, they constitute subtle symptoms of fetal distress.",
        "contents": "Clinical significance of fetal heart rate patterns during labor. I. Baseline patterns. From a population of 2,774 high-risk patients monitored during labor, 1,304 single pregnancies in cephalic presentation and with direct monitoring for at least 1 hour before completion or cesarean-section were studied. The maternal and fetal clinical data and the tracings were hand reviewed, coded, and programmed for computer analysis. In the record were studied baseline, its changes (tachycardia, fixed, saltatory), the accelerations, and the decelerations (early, variable, late). Fifty-four per cent had some type of FHR deceleration. Accelerations were recorded in over 12 per cent of all cases and were associated with cord problems in 41 per cent. Subgrouping the patients by age of gestation (less than or equal to 36 weeks, 37 to 41 weeks, and greater than or equal to 42 weeks) revealed a 10 per cent prolonged gestation rate and only 6.8 per cent premature; these had a lower 5 minute Apgar score. Fetal weight and age were positively correlated with Apgar score. Baseline changes were much frequent among pre- and postmature infants, particularly tachycardia in the latter (40 per cent). The premature infants had a 25 per cent incidence of fetal distress and the postmature infants had 20 per cent.

A 27-year-old woman, gravida 3, para 2, suffered from premature labor pain and vaginal bleeding at 32 weeks of gestation. Prenatal ultrasound examination revealed presence of three areas of cystic dilatation in the fetal abdomen and marked polyhydramnios, indicating a high bowel obstruction. A female baby was delivered by Cesarean section with Apgar scores of 7 and 8 at one and five minutes, respectively. Physical examination showed abdominal distention. Nasogastric tube aspiration got more than 50 ml of blood-tinged fluid. Roentgenography demonstrated a high jejunal obstruction as well as a normally rotated colon. Laparotomy disclosed proximal jejunal atresia with typical \"apple peel\" appearance of the distal small bowel. An end-to-end anastomosis was performed smoothly after resection of both the proximal and distal small bowels. A reduction tapering antimesenteric jejunoplasty was also done. Partial parenteral nutrition had been administered for 10 days followed by enteric feeding. The postoperative course was uneventful. Her chromosomal analysis revealed a normal karyotype of 46,XX.",

        "title": "Saltatory fetal heart rate pattern.",
        "content": "A retrospective descriptive study reviewed 433 consecutive intrapartum fetal heart tracings. The saltatory fetal heart rate pattern was defined as fetal heart amplitude changes of greater than 25 beats per minute with an oscillatory frequency of greater than 6 per minute for a minimum duration of 1 minute. Data were analyzed for each mother-infant pair over the time of labor and birth. The saltatory pattern was demonstrated in 10 of the 433 tracings reviewed for an overall incidence of 2.3%. All 10 fetuses demonstrating the saltatory pattern were term (38 to 42 weeks' gestation). None of the 147 preterm fetuses demonstrated the saltatory pattern (P less than .02). In 6 patients the saltatory pattern was observed after parenteral ephedrine administration, in 3 patients with uterine hyperstimulation, and in 1 patient during cervical examination. When the saltatory pattern was seen with ephedrine administration, it was present only at total doses of greater than or equal to 30 mg (P less than .001). In all patients the saltatory pattern occurred during active phase or second stage of labor. Short-term and long-term variability recorded by the fetal-scalp electrode were present both before and after the episode of saltatory pattern. At birth, all 10 infants were vigorous, with Apgar scores of 8/9 or 9/9. In the absence of abnormal periodic fetal heart rate changes and with the presence of short-term and long-term variability, the saltatory fetal heart rate pattern appears benign.",

        "content": "We reported two cases of rapid resolution of acute subdural hematoma. Case 1, a 21-year-old female, sustained head trauma and became unconscious for about 15 min. Probably she was suffering from posttraumatic amnesia for about 1 day. On admission J.C.S and G.C.S were 20 and 9 (2 + 2 + 5) points, respectively. Neurological examination showed no abnormalities. An initial computed tomography (CT) scan taken 2 hours after the injury showed a high dense subdural hematoma on the left cerebral hemisphere and hemispheric swelling. She was conservatively treated. A follow up CT scan taken 8 hours after the injury disclosed rapid disappearance of the hematoma and cerebral swelling. Case 2a 23-year-old male, sustained head trauma and became unconscious for about 30 min. On admission J.C.S and G.C.S were 1 and 14 (4 + 4 + 6) points, respectively, and slight right hemiparesis was noted. An initial CT scan taken 2 hours after the injury showed subdural hematoma of the left cerebral hemisphere and hemispheric swelling. He was conservatively treated. A follow up CT scan taken 24 hours after the injury revealed almost complete disappearance of the subdural hematoma and cerebral swelling. It was suggested that the rapid resolution of acute subdural hematoma was attributable to redistribution due to decrease of ICP, and washing out by cerebrospinal fluid.",
