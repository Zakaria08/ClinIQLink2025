With your own knowledge and the help of the following document:

Document 1 (Title: Ibuprofen): Treatment to address an ibuprofen overdose is based on how the symptoms present. In cases presenting early, decontamination of the stomach is recommended. This is achieved using activated charcoal; charcoal adsorbs the drug before it can enter the bloodstream. Gastric lavage is now rarely used, but can be considered if the amount ingested is potentially life-threatening, and it can be performed within 60 minutes of ingestion. Purposeful vomiting is not recommended. The majority of ibuprofen ingestions produce only mild effects, and the management of overdose is straightforward. Standard measures to maintain normal urine output should be instituted and kidney function monitored. Since ibuprofen has acidic properties and is also excreted in the urine, forced alkaline diuresis is theoretically beneficial. However, because ibuprofen is highly protein-bound in the blood, the kidneys' excretion of unchanged drug is minimal. Forced alkaline diuresis is, therefore, of limited benefit.
Document 2 (Title: Bufotalin): Toxicity Specifically, in cats the lethal median dose is 0.13 mg/kg. and in dogs is 0.36 mg/kg (intravenous). Knowing this it is advisable to monitor those functions continuously using an EKG. As there is no antidote against bufotalin all occurring symptoms need to be treated separately or if possible in combination with others. To increase the clearance theoretically, due to the similarities with digitoxin, cholestyramine, a bile salt, might help. Recent animal studies have shown that taurine restores cardiac functions. Symptomatic measures include lignocaine, atropine and phenytoin for cardiac toxicity and intravenous potassium compounds to correct hyperkalaemia from its effect on the Na+/K+ ATPase pump.
Document 3 (Title: Ascites): Monitoring diuresis: Diuresis can be monitored by weighing the person daily. The goal is weight loss of no more than 1.0 kg/day for people with both ascites and peripheral edema and no more than 0.5 kg/day for people with ascites alone. If daily weights cannot be obtained, diuretics can also be guided by the urinary sodium concentration. Dosage is increased until a negative sodium balance occurs. A random urine sodium-to-potassium ratio of > 1 is 90% sensitivity in predicting negative balance (> 78-mmol/day sodium excretion). Diuretic resistance: Diuretic resistance can be predicted by giving 80 mg intravenous furosemide after 3 days without diuretics and on an 80 mEq sodium/day diet. The urinary sodium excretion over 8 hours < 50 mEq/8 hours predicts resistance.
Document 4 (Title: Brodifacoum): Human poisoning Treatment The primary antidote to brodifacoum poisoning is immediate administration of vitamin K1 (dosage for humans: initially slow intravenous injections of 10–25 mg repeated at 3–6 hours until normalisation of the prothrombin time; then 10 mg orally four times daily as a "maintenance dose"). It is an extremely effective antidote, provided the poisoning is caught before excessive bleeding ensues. As high doses of brodifacoum can affect the body for many months, the antidote must be administered regularly for a long period (several months, in keeping with the substance's half-life) with frequent monitoring of the prothrombin time. If unabsorbed poison is still in the digestive system, gastric lavage followed by administration of activated charcoal may be required. Further treatments to be considered include infusion of blood or plasma to counteract hypovolemic shock, and in severe cases, infusion of blood clotting factor concentrate.
Document 5 (Title: Menispermum): Toxicity All parts of these plants are known to be poisonous, containing dauricine and related isoquinoline alkaloids, and children have died from eating the fruits. Dauricine inhibits cardiac K+ channels thus causing arrhythmia. Other symptoms caused by consumption of the grape-like fruits include excitation of the CNS, leading to seizures and neuromuscular arrest. First aid in cases of Menispermum poisoning involves the induction of vomiting, followed by the administration of medicinal charcoal and sodium sulphate. Clinical therapy : gastric lavage ( possibly with 0.1% potassium permanganate ) instillation of medicinal charcoal and sodium sulphate; electrolyte substitution, control of acidosis with sodium bicarbonate ( pH of urine 7.5 ). In case of spasms, intravenous administration of diazepam. Provision of intubation and oxygen respiration in case of respiratory arrest or paralysis. Checking of diuresis and kidney function.
