Used to relieve both exertional and vasospastic angina by allowing venous pooling, reducing the pressure in the ventricles and so reducing wall tension and oxygen requirements in, the heart. Short-acting nitrates are used to abort angina attacks that have occurred, while longer-acting nitrates are used in the prophylactic management of the condition. Agents include glyceryl trinitrate (GTN), pentaerythritol tetranitrate, isosorbide dinitrate and isosorbide mononitrate. Beta blockers Beta blockers are used in the prophylaxis of exertional angina by reducing the myocardial oxygen demand below the level that would provoke an angina attack.",

Maximal exercise capacity was also significantly improved following diltiazem and the drug combination, and it was not changed after IS-5-MN. ST segment depression was less pronounced after diltiazem and the combination compared to IS-5-MN. There was no difference in exercise capacity or ST segment change between diltiazem and the combination. The PR interval was slightly prolonged after diltiazem, but this was of no clinical importance. Adverse effects of diltiazem treatment were rare. Headache was common following IS-5-MN (13 patients) and the combination (11 patients). Thus, sustained-release diltiazem was of value in the treatment of chronic stable angina pectoris, whereas IS-5-MN was not effective, either as a single therapy or in combination with diltiazem. The reason for the inefficacy of IS-5-MN is not known, but the development of tolerance and an inadequate dose are possible explanations.",

        "content": "32 patients with stable angina pectoris who had been receiving a controlled-release formulation Durules of isosorbide 5-mononitrate (Imdur) 60 to 120 mg daily with concomitant beta-blocker therapy for at least 1 year were entered into a study to evaluate possible rebound phenomena from the abrupt withdrawal of isosorbide 5-mononitrate and to determine whether nitrate tolerance had developed. Isosorbide 5-mononitrate was abruptly withdrawn and substituted with placebo for 2 weeks, after which the active drug was reintroduced. No deterioration of exercise performance could be detected during withdrawal of therapy, but an increase was seen after reinstitution. No tolerance was found for systolic blood pressure and ST segment changes or for the number of anginal attacks and short-acting glyceryl trinitrate tablets consumed. Three patients had to be hospitalised because of a sudden deterioration of symptoms on withdrawal of isosorbide 5-mononitrate. It was concluded that isosorbide 5-mononitrate in Durules has a beneficial effect and that tolerance does not appear to be clinically relevant.",

        "title": "Sustained hemodynamic and antianginal effect of high dose oral isosorbide dinitrate.",
        "content": "Twenty-one patients with documented coronary atherosclerotic heart disease were studied to determine the effect of high dose oral isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) on heart rate, blood pressure, and exercise time until angina pectoris. Patients were tested in two phases, initially with 0.4 mg of sublingual nitroglycerin and with sublingual placebo, and then with oral ISDN, mean dose 29 mg, and oral placebo. Both phases of the study were conducted in a randomized, double-blind, crossover manner. After ISDN was compared to oral placebo, heart rate increased at 30 to 300 min (P less than 0.01) (peak increase 18 beats/min at 60 min), and systolic blood pressure decreased from 45 to 300 min (P less than 0.005) (peak decrease 18 mm Hg at 60 min). Exercise time at 2 min after sublingual nitroglycerin increased 51% as compared to oral placebo, exercise time increased 54% at 1 hr (P less than 0.005), 37% at 3 hr (P less than 0.01), and 12% at 5 hr (NS). Twelve of 21 patients (57%) improved their exercise time until angina larger than or equal to 25% at 1 hr after oral ISDN. The exercise response to sublingual nitroglycerin was a good predictor of this response to oral ISDN.",
