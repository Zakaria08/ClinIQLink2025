Document 1 (Title: Thyroglossal cyst): Thyroglossal cysts develop at birth. Many diagnostic procedures may be used to establish the degree of the cyst. Signs and symptoms Thyroglossal duct cysts most often present with a palpable asymptomatic midline neck mass usually below [65% of the time] the level of the hyoid bone. The mass on the neck moves during swallowing or on protrusion of the tongue because of its attachment to the tongue via the tract of thyroid descent. Some patients will have neck or throat pain, or dysphagia.
Document 2 (Title: Thyroglossal cyst): A thyroglossal cyst is a fibrous cyst that forms from a persistent thyroglossal duct. Thyroglossal cysts can be defined as an irregular neck mass or a lump which develops from cells and tissues left over after the formation of the thyroid gland during developmental stages. Thyroglossal cysts are the most common cause of midline neck masses and are generally located caudal to (below) the hyoid bone. These neck masses can occur anywhere along the path of the thyroglossal duct, from the base of the tongue to the suprasternal notch. Other common causes of midline neck masses include lymphadenopathy, dermoid cysts, and various odontogenic anomalies. Thyroglossal cysts develop at birth. Many diagnostic procedures may be used to establish the degree of the cyst.
Document 3 (Title: Persistent thyroglossal duct): Three-fourths of abnormalities within a persistent thyroglossal duct involve the formation of a cyst. If a persistent thyroglossal duct becomes fluid filled it will form a thyroglossal duct cyst, which accounts for 70% of congenital neck masses and is the most likely diagnosis if the mass is along the midline of the neck. These cysts are often diagnosed in children under the age of ten and have no particular gender prevalence. The cysts are normally asymptomatic at this age and are noticed because of the swelling that will move if the patient swallows. Over 80% of these cysts are located at or below the hyoid bone.
Document 4 (Title: Thyroglossal cyst): The persistent duct or sinus can promote oral secretions, which may cause cysts to become infected. Up to half of thyroglossal cysts are not diagnosed until adult life. The tract can lie dormant for years or even decades, until some kind of stimulus leads to cystic dilation. Infection can sometimes cause the transient appearance of a mass or enlargement of the cyst, at times with periodic recurrences. Spontaneous drainage may also occur. Differential diagnosis are ectopic thyroid, enlarged lymph nodes, dermoid cysts and goiter. Thyroglossal cyst usually presents as a midline neck lump (in the region of the hyoid bone) that is usually painless, smooth and cystic, though if infected, pain can occur. There may be difficulty breathing, dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), or dyspepsia (discomfort in the upper abdomen), especially if the cyst becomes large.
Document 5 (Title: Thyroglossal cyst): The most common location for a thyroglossal cyst is midline or slightly off midline, between the isthmus of the thyroid and the hyoid bone or just above the hyoid bone. A thyroglossal cyst can develop anywhere along a thyroglossal duct, though cysts within the tongue or in the floor of the mouth are rare.A thyroglossal cyst will move upwards with protrusion of the tongue.Thyroglossal cysts are associated with an increased incidence of ectopic thyroid tissue. Occasionally, a lingual thyroid can be seen as a flattened strawberry-like lump at the base of the tongue. Complications

Question: A 13-year-old girl presents to a medical office for the evaluation of a lump on the front of her neck. The patient denies pain, but states that the mass bothers her because “it moves when I swallow”. The physical examination reveals a midline neck mass that is above the hyoid bone but below the level of the mandible. The mass is minimally mobile and feels fluctuant without erythema. The patient is afebrile and all vital signs are stable. A complete blood count and thyroid function tests are performed and are within normal limits. What is the most likely cause of this patient’s presentation?
Options:
A. Persistent thyroid tissue at the tongue base
B. Deletion of the 22q11 gene
C. Cyst formation in a persistent thyroglossal duct
D. Lymph node enlargement
