        "content": "Five species of genus Plasmodium are known to cause malaria in humans. The vector for Plasmodium spp. is a female A nopheles mosquito that inoculates sporozoites contained in her salivary glands into the puncture wound when feeding. [3] Sporozoites enter peripheral bloodstream and are uptaken by hepatocytes, where they undergo an asexual pre-erythrocytic liver-stage as liver schizonts lasting up to 2 weeks before the onset of the blood stage. [3] [4] As they replicate within hepatocytes, they form motile merozoites that are subsequently released into the bloodstream, where they invade red blood cells (RBC). The process continues through serial cycles of asexual replication of merozoites that go through ring, trophozoite, and schizont stages before forming and releasing new invasive daughter merozoites that consequently infect new RBC, therefore causing a rise in parasite numbers. [3] [5] P. falciparum produces high levels of blood-stage parasites and is known to modify the surface of the infected RBC, creating an adhesive phenotype, e.g. (sticky cell) causing RBC sequestration inside small and middle-sized vessels, removing the parasite from the circulation for nearly half of the asexual cycle. [6] Sequestration leads to splenic parasite clearance avoidance, host cell endothelial damage, and microvascular obstruction. [5] [6] A small fraction of intra-erythrocytic parasites switch to sexual development, producing morphologically distinct male and female gametocytes that reach the host's dermis and are ingested by a mosquito, rendering it infectious to humans. [3] [4] [5] After ingestion by a female A nopheles mosquito, the male micro-gametocytes go through a process of ex-flagellation in the mosquito's midgut, fusing with female macro-gametes to form a zygote. The zygote then reaches the stage of ookinete that migrates through a thin wall, matures into oocyst, producing and upon rupturing, releasing numerous sporozoites that are dispersed throughout mosquitos body, including salivary glands, therefore completing the lifecycle. Gametocytes are hence of vital importance to the transmission cycle of malaria.

The vertebrate hosts for this parasite are reptiles. Description The parasite was first described by Telford and Wellehan in 2005. Neither the schizonts nor the gametocytes have any effect upon dimensions of host erythrocytes or their nuclei. The schizonts average 4.3 x 3.5 micrometres (range: 3.0 - 6.0 x 3.0 - 5.0) in size. They produce on average 4.9 merozoites (range: 3.0 - 8.0) which are usually arranged as a fan. The gametocytes average 5.9 x 5.5 micrometre (range: 5.0 - 6.6 x 5.0 - 6.0). The length x width product is 31.9 micrometre^2 (range: 25 - 40) and the length/width ratio is 1.06 (1.0 - 1.2). The gametocytes are not sexually dimorphic in either size or shape. Geographical occurrence This species is found in New Guinea. Clinical features and host pathology This species infects the crocodile skink Tribolonotus gracilis.",

        "content": "The newly released merozoites infect either erythrocytes, leukocytes, macrophages or endothelial cells. Those infecting the macrophages or endothelial cells develop into megaloschizonts. The megaloschizonts divide into primary cytomeres, which in turn multiply into smaller cytomeres, which mature into schizonts, which in turn divide into merozoites. In erythrocytes or leukocytes, merozoites develop into gametocytes. The gametocytes are taken up by a blood-sucking fly as it bites the bird host. Gametocytes then mature in the insect midgut into macrogametocytes (female) with red-staining nuclei and microgametocytes (male) with pale-staining diffuse nuclei: these fuse to form an ookinete. The male gametocytes normally give rise to eight microgametes. The ookinete penetrates an intestinal cell of the fly and matures into an oocyst. After several days the oocyst produces ~100 sporozoites that leave and migrate to the salivary glands of the fly.",
