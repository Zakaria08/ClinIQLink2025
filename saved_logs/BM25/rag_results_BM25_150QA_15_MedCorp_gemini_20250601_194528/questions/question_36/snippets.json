        "content": "A case of myasthenia gravis accompanied with polymyositis and malignant thymoma, detected immune complexes in the sera and around the muscle fibers, was described. A 37-year-old woman was admitted to Shinshu University Hospital in September, 1987 because of dyspnea, dysphagia and muscle weakness. She first noticed her right blepharoptosis 3 weeks before admission. Weakness of all four limbs and myalgia of lower extremities were noticed one week later. These symptoms got worse and nocturnal dyspnea, dysphagia and easy fatigability at mastication appeared. On admission, she looked ill and neurological examination revealed left blepharoptosis, bilateral facial weakness, weakness of all four limbs, more prominent in proximal muscles and tenderness of lower extremities. Edrophonium test was positive, improving her muscle weakness. Laboratory examination revealed the elevated serum levels of CK, the increased titre of circulating immune complexes and high titres of acetylcholine receptor antibodies and anti-skeletal muscle antibodies. Electromyographic study showed myogenic pattern and Harvey-Masland test revealed waning at low frequency stimulation. Muscle biopsy showed marked perivascular infiltration of lymphocytes, accompanied by phagocytosis and interstitial fibrosis. IgG deposits were shown around the muscle fibers exclusively around the infiltrates of mononuclear cells. Granular deposits of C3 were also shown specifically around the muscle fibers exclusively around the infiltrates of mononuclear cells. Thymectomy was performed on September 21, 1987. Invasion of thymoma, predominantly lymphocytic type, to right lung and pericardium was observed histologically. After thymectomy, she got better. Immunological data and immunohistochemical examination of the present case suggest that in the case of myasthenia gravis accompanied with polymyositis and malignant thymoma, immune complexes may play a primary role on the pathogenesis of myositis.",

        "content": "The patient was a 64-year-old woman who showed muscle weakness and tremor of upper extremities and gait disturbance at the age of 62 years. The symptoms progressed and she was admitted to our hospital. Neurological examination revealed muscle weakness, muscle atrophy and fasciculation bilaterally in the upper extremities. The deep tendon reflexes were reduced in the upper extremities and increased in the lower extremities, but Babinski's sign was not present. There was mild hand tremor at rest (right greater than left). Muscle rigidity was also evident. Her gait was small-stepped and her trunk was bent forward. She showed hypomimia, but no dementia was detected. She died of respiratory failure 7 months after admission. The duration of the illness was about 2 years. At autopsy, macroscopic examination showed depigmentation of the substantia nigra and locus ceruleus, and atrophy of the anterior roots of the spinal cord. Microscopic examination revealed a few senile plaques in the temporal cortex. In the substantia nigra, the number of melanin-containing cells was decreased in its central parts. A few Lewy bodies were found in some of the remaining neurons, and melanin pigment migrated into the parenchyma. In the locus ceruleus and dorsal motor nucleus of vagus, abundant Lewy bodies and mild astrocytosis were seen.

        "content": "Signs and symptoms The weakness from LEMS typically involves the muscles of the proximal arms and legs (the muscles closer to the trunk). In contrast to myasthenia gravis, the weakness affects the legs more than the arms. This leads to difficulties climbing stairs and rising from a sitting position. Weakness is often relieved temporarily after exertion or physical exercise. High temperatures can worsen the symptoms. Weakness of the bulbar muscles (muscles of the mouth and throat) is occasionally encountered. Weakness of the eye muscles is uncommon. Some may have double vision, drooping of the eyelids and difficulty swallowing, but generally only together with leg weakness; this too distinguishes LEMS from myasthenia gravis, in which eye signs are much more common. In the advanced stages of the disease, weakness of the respiratory muscles may occur. Some may also experience problems with coordination (ataxia).",

        "content": "A 2-year-old girl with reducing body myopathy was reported. She had no family history of neuromuscular disease. She developed normally with no delay in milestones during infancy. She had no muscle weakness or hypotonia up to 2 years of age when she received mumps vaccination. Three days after the injection, she was first noticed to have limb muscle weakness. The muscle weakness progressed rapidly with increasing difficulty in gait and raising the upper arms, particularly the left. Four months later, she had difficulty in keeping her head up and could no longer climb the stairs. On physical examination, she had proximal dominant generalized muscle weakness, with a preferential neck muscle involvement. She walked waddlingly and stood up with Gowers' maneuver. Facial and ocular muscles were intact. No dysarthria, dysphagia or respiratory difficulty was noted. EMG showed myopathic pattern. Serum creatine kinase level was moderately elevated to 739 IU/l. In the biopsied left biceps muscle, there was marked variation in fiber size, but no apparent necrotic or regenerating fibers. The most striking feature was the presence of numerous eosinophilic inclusions which reduced nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) and were, therefore, stained dark with menadione-linked alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase even without the substrate of menadione, showing the histochemical characteristics of \"reducing\" body. The bodies were predominantly seen in fibers with disorganized intermyofibrillar networks and with high acid phosphatase activity. On electron microscopy, the reducing bodies consisted of fine granular material with the similar electron density to the chromatin granules and were located mostly around the degenerated nuclei, suggesting the nuclear degeneration playing a role in forming the reducing bodies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "content": "A Japanese woman, aged 42, was admitted because of paroxysmal attacks consisting of paresthesia of the left face, tremor in the right hand, epigastric pain and urinary incontinence. A year prior to the admission, she noticed some difficulty in writing, dysarthria and unsteadiness of walking. These symptoms had been persistent since then. At the end of March, 1991, these symptoms rapidly worsened, and she fell down frequently. She also experienced pain behind both eyes, numbness in her left fingers and toe, urinary frequency and the above-mentioned attacks. Neurological examination disclosed bilateral internuclear ophthalmoplegia and upbeating nystagmus on upward gaze, titubation in the head, scanning speech, dysmetria in all limbs, exaggerated reflexes in jaw and both legs, bilateral extensor plantar reflexes and ankle clonus. SEP showed delayed cortical response with stimulation of the median nerves bilaterally and of the right posterior tibial nerve. P40 was absent with the left posterior tibial nerve stimulation. VEP was normal. T2-weighted image of MRI showed multiple high intensity areas located around the third ventricle, crus cerebri and the right upper part of the pons.

Laboratory examinations showed elevated levels of serum creatine kinase and aldolase, positive antinuclear antibody of speckled pattern and a mild disturbance in carbohydrate absorption. Endocrinological tests suggested the dysfunction of hypothalamus as a cause of amenorrhea. Electromyogram showed large action potentials on spasms.

Physical examination at 14 years of age revealed a gentle and shy child of short stature with brown-black kinky hair. Neurological examinations revealed progressive mental retardation, optic nerve atrophy, moderate and coarse nystagmus on lateral and vertical gaze, atrophic tongue with fasciculations, slow and scanning speech, distal muscular weaknesses with diffuse atrophies in the four extremities and sensory deficiencies in all modalities with a glove-stocking type distribution. At the age of 15, she was unable to walk without a wheelchair. During the course she showed slowly progressive muscular weakness, ataxia and decreasing sensation especially in the lower extremities.

MRI of the brain revealed multiple areas of high signal intensity on T2-weighted image, consistent with multiple sclerosis. The signs and symptoms resolved substantially within two months. The syrinx within the thoracic cord reduced in size after two months and disappeared after three months. Two months after the second episode of myelopathy, she experienced right optic neuritis, resolving substantially within three weeks. This case was diagnosed as definite multiple sclerosis based on the clinical and radiological findings.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "content": "Central nervous system is rarely involved in progressive systemic sclerosis (PSS) unless there are concomitant abnormalities in renal or lung function or hypertension. A 72-year-old woman with typical PSS developed cerebellar bleeding. Medical history records revealed, she had noted the onset of Raynaud's sign on her upper extremities at the age of 37. This was followed by necrosis and repeated infection, and as a result, shortening of her fingers in her 40's. The disease progressed and involved lower extremities, and then face and body in her 50's. Aortic valve stenosis was diagnosed at 69 year old, cardiac myopathy at 70 and at the age of 71 infectious dermatitis in both inguinal regions. Mild anemia, hypoalbuminemia and the decrease of serum Fe were discovered in June 1988. At the same time, prolonged ESR, positive C-reactive protein, RA, and anti-nuclear-antibody were also noticed. A chest roentgenogram revealed pulmonary fibrosis. Systemic hypertension was not noticed on the clinical course. She developed an onset of vertigo and vomiting in the morning of August 8, 1988. Consequently, she was brought to our hospital. She was alert but a physical examination showed a swallowing disturbance, dysarthria, right cerebellar ataxia, nystagmus and hypertension (192/100 mmHg). A CT examination on admission revealed a slightly low density area in right cerebellar hemisphere without mass effect. She was treated with dextran and mannitol and her condition improved on the 6th day of her admission. She was alert and blood pressure calm down to 120/70 mmHg without the use of anti-hypertension drugs on August 21.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "content": "We report a case of a 50-year-old woman with traumatic dissection of the right common carotid artery secondary to attempted suicidal hanging. Initial examination showed marks of strangulation on the neck, facial edema, and multiple conjunctival petechiae accompanied by difficulty in breathing and loss of consciousness. She gradually recovered except for her left upper limb weakness. Rehabilitation, with a diagnosis of left brachial plexus injury, was started. Two years later, she occasionally felt numbness of the left upper extremity. On her second admission, a bruit was heard on the right side of her neck. Neurological examination did not reveal any change. CT scan showed atrophic changes. Angiography demonstrated approximately 80% stenosis of the right common carotid artery which was thought to be responsible for the attacks of numbness. Right carotid endarterectomy was performed. Histological findings revealed dissection of the medial layer of the arterial wall. Complaints of numbness disappeared postoperatively, and angiography showed good patency at a follow-up examination. We conclude that the stenosis of the common carotid artery was not due to atherosclerosis but due to the dissection as a result of hanging.",

        "content": "We report a case with \"releasing phenomenon of well learned praxis\" with right hand caused by cerebral infarction in the territory of left anterior cerebral artery. A 71-year-old right-handed woman suddenly developed motor paralysis in right lower and upper limbs associated with mutism. Motor paralysis of the right upper limb and speech disturbance improved gradually. At this period it was noted that she grasped and used an object in front of her with right hand against her own will. The neurological findings about one month after the onset of the disease revealed very mild weakness of the right upper extremity and severe motor paralysis of the right lower limb. In addition, tendon reflex was exaggerated in the right lower limb and sensory disturbance was noted in the region distal from the right knee. Neuropsychologically, ideomotor apraxia was observed in the left hand. Pathological gasping of the right hand was also noted. When the patient saw and touched an object, she used it with her right hand against her own will, and her left hand voluntarily hindered the right hand. This behavior is apparently similar with the \"compulsive manipulation of tools\" reported previously. However, the following hitherto unknown phenomena were observed in the present patient: Her right hand performed pantomimic movement for the use of objects orally described by the examiner without visually presenting them. The right hand also tended to imitate the gestures of the examiner automatically, even if the patient was not asked for imitating the gestures. These behavioral abnormalities of the right hand was thought to be liberated from the inhibition system.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "content": "This is a report of a young girl who showed a recurrence of acute worsening and remission of neurological manifestations, with consistent MRI demonstration of transaxial septated syrinxes in the cervical and the lumbar spinal cord in addition to a tight filum terminale. This 8 year-old girl had developed normally since her birth until August 1989 when she developed a gait disturbance. This worsened acutely on January 1, 1990, with the additional manifestation of a urinary bladder disturbance. General examination failed to show any abnormality or scoliosis. Neurologic examination revealed a monoparesis of the right lower extremity with muscle atrophy and pyramidal tract sign. Fecal constipation and urinary retention were noted. The MRI T1 weighted sagittal image demonstrated an incontinuous low intensity signal in the C1-C7 as well as in the T12-L2 without swelling of the cord. The axial image clearly demonstrated the septations in the syrinx which looked like eye glasses. No definite Gd enhancement was demonstrated. Chiari malformation was not associated, but the tethered cord was well identified. With the administration of steroid, she showed a marked improvement of neurological manifestations. She was able to urinate without difficulty and also walk by herself. For one month thereafter she remained well with minor neurological deficits until she developed a worsening of the gait disturbance with a newly manifested weakness of the left upper extremity. Sensory impairment was also demonstrated below L3. In contrast to the worsening of the clinical symptoms, no definite change in the abnormalities found by MRI was noted.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "content": "Two siblings of hereditary progressive dystonia with marked diurnal fluctuation are reported in this communication. The case 1 is a 50-year-old woman who developed dystonia in the right lower extremity at the age of 8 which deteriorated in the afternoon. At the age of 13 she became unable to walk in the afternoon because of dystonia, but after the age of 23 her symptoms began to ameliorate and at the age of 29 her daily activities became no longer disturbed by dystonia even in the evening. However, at the age of 42 dystonia in the lower extremities began to worsen again toward the end of the day and after the age of 47 dystonia appeared in the all extremities. Since the age of 49 she had been able to walk only for three hours after awakening. Her 37-year-old half sister, case 2, also developed a slight dystonia in the left upper extremity at the age of 8. At the age of 33 she felt tight in the neck, waist and extremities after hard works in the evening, and the worst of it was in the left arm which would not move. Both cases were well responsive to L-dopa. Their family history revealed that their father had a history of dystonia the course of which was similar to that of the case 1. Dominant inheritance could be considered in this family. These findings would suggest that hereditary progressive dystonia with marked diurnal fluctuation could show not only a diurnal fluctuation but also age-dependent changes of symptoms. Its basic abnormalities might exist in the dopamine storage pool.",
