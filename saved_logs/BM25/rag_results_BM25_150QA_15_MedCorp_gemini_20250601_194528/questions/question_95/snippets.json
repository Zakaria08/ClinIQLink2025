        "content": "Health Maintenance Organization (HMOs) are repeatedly described as a general solution to the health care crisis and a specific solution to the problems confronting Medicare and Medicaid. The potential incorporation of HMOs into Medicaid has promised to improve the states' ability to accurately budget program expenditures, simplify management, eliminate abusive practices directly linked to fee-for-service (e.g., billing for undelivered services for providing unnecessary care) and, most important, contain costs. At the same time it has promised to increase access to mainstream medicine. Experience has shown, however, that the promise has often been severely compromised by unethical HMO marketing practices, inadequacy of services and excessive administrative costs. This article examines some of the reasons: the political process which created HMOs, the rhetorical claims which exaggerated the strengths of prepaid group practice and distorted the formulation of policy, and the peculiar characteristics of the Medicaid program which have caused Medicaid HMOs to deviate considerably from theoretical expectations.",

The study also examines the medical care utilization of low income persons enrolled in a prepaid health plan with a similar group of low income persons enrolled in the health plan but also eligible for Medicaid benefits. Utilization and population-at-risk data were obtained from the Kaiser-Permanente Medical Care Program of Portland, Oregon and from the State of Oregon Welfare Division. A hypothesis of lower hospital utilization by low income enrollees compared with Medicaid recipients was accepted. A hypothesis of higher ambulatory care utilization was accepted for diagnostic procedures and prescription use, but rejected for office visit utilization. An analysis of the findings appeared to implicate the Medicaid program for differences observed. The hypotheses of no significant differences in inpatient and ambulatory medical care utilization of low income health plan enrollees with and without Medicaid eligibility were generally rejected. Low income enrollees with concurrent Medicaid had consistently higher utilization rates for all services resulting in substantially higher medical care expenditures per person.

The MDs who participated were reimbursed at rates higher than the regular Medicaid fee schedule, either through augmented fees for specific services or through monthly capitation payments. Using the Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS) claims data, we compared the rates at which children in the experimental program and children in the regular Medicaid program were seen by a physician during a one-year period. The majority of experimental children received regular and frequent care from primary care physicians during the demonstration. After controlling for race and prior utilization differences, we found that augmented fee-for-service children received more primary care from office-based physicians than children in the regular Medicaid program. Capitation children received at least the same amount of primary care as children in the regular Medicaid program. We interpret our data to mean that capitation payment, untied to the delivery of services, does not necessarily reduce access to primary care and that higher fees for physicians who treat children may, in fact, increase access.",

During the initial 30 months of operation the four S/HMOs shared financial risk with the Health Care Financing Administration. This article reports on this developmental period. During this phase the S/HMOs had lower-than-expected enrollment levels due in part to market competition, underfunding of marketing efforts, the limited geographic area served, and an inability to differentiate the S/HMO product from that of other Medicare HMOs. The S/HMOs were allowed to conduct health screening of applicants prior to enrolling them.

        "content": "During the 1980s both the federal government and the private sector articulated policies to encourage the development and participation of health maintenance organizations (HMOs) in the Medicaid program. However, the policies, intended to save costs, limited the ability of new HMOs to achieve financial independence. New plans that emphasize Medicaid participation have few, if any, options on benefit design or in setting capitation rates. Relative to fee-for-service Medicaid programs, their costs to provide services may be quite high, as they have neither the buying power not the ability to impose discounts. As a consequence, plans must focus their financial planning efforts on targeting and attaining a stable enrollment base and on controlling the amount of services provided, tasks that are difficult for all HMOs. Achieving a stable enrollment base is particularly hard because Medicaid eligibles have few incentives to enroll and once enrolled often lose their Medicaid eligibility. Traditional HMOs control the amount of services provided through physician selection, financial incentives on physicians, and monitoring and utilization review. Lack of information and the difficulty inherent in attracting sufficient provider participation limit the first two strategies, so new plans often adopt organization structures that rely heavily on monitoring activities. Unfortunately, management information systems for HMOs are often the weakest link.

Such provider contracts are not agreements to collaborate on the education of residents, but rather contractual arrangements under which individual physicians or groups (who happen to be residents or faculty) agree to provide services to HMO enrollees in return for some form of compensation. In 1990, the Group Health Association of America conducted a survey of a sample of residency training programs in family medicine, internal medicine, and pediatrics to ascertain the extent to which (1) residents and faculty of residency training programs are participating physicians in HMOs; and (2) HMO enrollees are serving as the patient base for GME in ambulatory settings.

Therefore, the authors used data from the National Institute of Mental Health Epidemiologic Catchment Area (ECA) study to examine differences in the prevalence of psychiatric disorder and differences in the use of outpatient mental health services for adults enrolled in HMO or fee-for-service health insurance plans. The subjects were an ECA community sample obtained from East Los Angeles and West Los Angeles. This sample included a large number of Hispanic subjects. The subjects were categorized according to their responses to a 5-item battery on insurance as Medicare enrolles, members of private fee-for-service plans, Medicaid enrollees, members of an HMO, and uninsured. The presence or absence of psychiatric disorders was determined by using the NIMH Diagnostic Interview Schedule. Both users and nonusers of mental health services were studied. The HMO and fee-for-service plans had similar prevalence of psychiatric disorder and similar access to specialty mental health care.

The HMO and fee-for-service plans had similar prevalence of psychiatric disorder and similar access to specialty mental health care. However, HMO enrollees had significantly fewer visits per user to providers of specialty care. The most likely explanation for lower mental health care costs in HMOs is a less intensive style of care for a comparably sick population.",

        "content": "A point of service plan is a type of managed care health insurance plan in the United States. It combines characteristics of the health maintenance organization (HMO) and the preferred provider organization (PPO). The POS is based on a managed care foundation—lower medical costs in exchange for more limited choice. But POS health insurance does differ from other managed care plans. Enrollees in a POS plan are required to choose a primary care physician (PCP) from within the health care network; this PCP becomes their \"point of service\". The PCP may make referrals outside the network, but with lesser compensation offered by the patient's health insurance company. For medical visits within the health care network, paperwork is usually completed for the patient. If the patient chooses to go outside the network, it is the patient's responsibility to fill out forms, send bills in for payment, and keep an accurate account of health care receipts. References",

The hypotheses studied are complex issues that concern mental-health advocates and providers. Traditional community-based mental health services have always struggled to maintain their presence in the health care field, having to contend with changing funding priorities and more serious and multiple problems presented by their patients. For prepaid plans to work effectively for the indigent mentally ill, the complex issues have to be made clear and acknowledged as meaningful variables.",
