In acute poisoning, a single large dose is taken; in chronic poisoning, higher than normal doses are taken over a period of time. Acute overdose has a mortality rate of 2%. Chronic overdose is more commonly lethal, with a mortality rate of 25%; chronic overdose may be especially severe in children. Toxicity is managed with a number of potential treatments, including activated charcoal, intravenous dextrose and normal saline, sodium bicarbonate, and dialysis. The diagnosis of poisoning usually involves measurement of plasma salicylate, the active metabolite of aspirin, by automated spectrophotometric methods. Plasma salicylate levels in general range from 30 to 100mg/l after usual therapeutic doses, 50–300mg/l in people taking high doses and 700–1400mg/l following acute overdose. Salicylate is also produced as a result of exposure to bismuth subsalicylate, methyl salicylate, and sodium salicylate.",

The addition of hemodialysis to such a regimen is helpful in three ways. First, it removes the small extracellular reservoir of cyanide, particularly if the poison is still being absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Second, it corrects the severe lactic acidosis seen in virtually all cases of cyanide toxicity. As with most poisons death from metabolic acidosis alone is likely. Third, the removal of thiocyanate, the end product of cyanide metabolism, results in a maneuver which should decrease both tissue and plasma cyanide levels. The immediate treatment of acute cyanide intoxication is supportive, as it is with most all drugs and poisons. Gastric lavage using activated charcoal should be initiated immediately to remove any remaining cyanide in the gastrointestinal tract. Simultaneously, high flow oxygen should be administered either by nasal cannula or by endotracheal intubation. Correction of the metabolic acidosis should be instituted with bicarbonate. Immediate hemodialysis should be performed with the concomitant administration of thiosulfate. Animal studies suggest that continuous infusion of thiosulfate (12 mg/kg/hr) is more effective for treating cyanide intoxication than is bolus administration (41, 51).

Chronic salicylate intoxication which is most common in the elderly, may occur with therapeutic doses. Increased toxicity in older patients often appears due to inadvertent overdosage. Dual prescribing or additional use of nonprescription salicylates are some causes of unwitting long term toxicity.

These changes are of increased importance in the elderly using high therapeutic doses of salicylates when metabolism is saturated and more unchanged drug is available for renal excretion. In the face of renal impairment, the risk of toxicity is increased. The diagnosis of acute salicylate intoxication generally does not pose diagnostic problems. Patients often present with a history of intentional overdose, with hyperventilation, fever, and nausea. The diagnosis can be confirmed by measuring serum salicylate concentrations. Chronic intoxication often poses a diagnostic dilemma with atypical presentations mimicking other disease states such as diabetic ketoacidosis, delirium, cerebrovascular accident, myocardial infarction or cardiac failure. The diagnosis of salicylate intoxication should be borne in mind when an older patient presents with recent deterioration in activities of daily living with no known cause. Plasma salicylate concentrations should be measured if salicylate intoxication is suspected, even if there is no documented history of salicylate ingestion. The risk of salicylate nephrotoxicity is also increased with age, and upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage is associated with increased mortality in older age groups. Treatment of acute toxicity consists of prompt recognition of salicylate intoxication, use of activated charcoal, correction of acid-base abnormalities, general supportive measures, and if concentrations are extremely high, dialysis can be effectively used. Chronic toxicity, which can occur even with marginally high salicylate concentrations, is treated with drug withdrawal and supportive therapy. Chronic salicylate toxicity can be averted by prescription of conservative doses of drug, avoidance of concomitant use of different salicylate preparations, and therapeutic monitoring to guide dosage.
