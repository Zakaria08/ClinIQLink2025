Document 1 (Title: High-density lipoprotein): Recommended ranges The American Heart Association, NIH and NCEP provide a set of guidelines for fasting HDL levels and risk for heart disease. High LDL with low HDL level is an additional risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Measuring HDL concentration and sizes As technology has reduced costs and clinical trials have continued to demonstrate the importance of HDL, methods for directly measuring HDL concentrations and size (which indicates function) at lower costs have become more widely available and increasingly regarded as important for assessing individual risk for progressive arterial disease and treatment methods. Electrophoresis measurements Since the HDL particles have a net negative charge and vary by density & size, ultracentrifugation combined with electrophoresis have been utilized since before 1950 to enumerate the concentration of HDL particles and sort them by size with a specific volume of blood plasma. Larger HDL particles are carrying more cholesterol.
Document 2 (Title: APOA5): Apolipoprotein A-V is a protein that in humans is encoded by the APOA5 gene on chromosome 11. It is significantly expressed in liver. The protein encoded by this gene is an apolipoprotein and an important determinant of plasma triglyceride levels, a major risk factor for coronary artery disease. It is a component of several lipoprotein fractions including VLDL, HDL, chylomicrons. It is believed that apoA-V affects lipoprotein metabolism by interacting with LDL-R gene family receptors. Considering its association with lipoprotein levels, APOA5 is implicated in metabolic syndrome. The APOA5 gene also contains one of 27 SNPs associated with increased risk of coronary artery disease.

Document 3 (Title: Coronary artery disease): Job stress appears to play a minor role accounting for about 3% of cases. In one study, women who were free of stress from work life saw an increase in the diameter of their blood vessels, leading to decreased progression of atherosclerosis. In contrast, women who had high levels of work-related stress experienced a decrease in the diameter of their blood vessels and significantly increased disease progression. Having a type A behavior pattern, a group of personality characteristics including time urgency, competitiveness, hostility, and impatience, is linked to an increased risk of coronary disease. Blood fats High blood cholesterol (specifically, serum LDL concentrations). HDL (high density lipoprotein) has a protective effect over development of coronary artery disease. High blood triglycerides may play a role. High levels of lipoprotein(a), a compound formed when LDL cholesterol combines with a protein known as apolipoprotein(a).
Document 4 (Title: Apolipoprotein C-III): Clinical significance Overexpression of Apo-CIII in humans contributes to atherosclerosis. Two novel susceptibility haplotypes (specifically, P2-S2-X1 and P1-S2-X1) have been discovered in ApoAI-CIII-AIV gene cluster on chromosome 11q23; these confer approximately threefold higher risk of coronary heart disease in normal as well as non-insulin diabetes mellitus. In persons with type 2 diabetes, elevated plasma Apo-CIII is associated with higher plasma triglycerides and greater coronary artery calcification (a measure of subclinical atherosclerosis). Apo-CIII delays the catabolism of triglyceride rich particles. HDL cholesterol particles that bear Apo-CIII are associated with increased, rather than decreased, risk for coronary heart disease. Elevations of Apo-CIII found in genetic variation studies may predispose patients to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Interactive pathway map
Document 5 (Title: Beta-blockers, plasma lipids, and coronary heart disease.): High plasma cholesterol concentration is an important coronary heart disease risk factor, particularly in subjects less than 50 years old. Cholesterol is transported mainly by low (LDLs) and high (HDLs) density lipoproteins. High plasma levels of HDL and its apolipoprotein (A-I) are associated with low coronary heart disease risk, and the reverse is true for LDL and its apolipoprotein (B). Plasma levels of very low density lipoproteins (VLDLs) are probably not an independent risk factor, and the situation for plasma triglycerides is unclear. beta-Blockers have no significant effects on plasma concentrations of either total or LDL cholesterol, but HDL plasma concentration is reduced by about 10%, particularly by nonselective beta-blockers. Plasma triglyceride and VLDL concentrations are both raised by beta-blockade. Despite these plasma lipid changes, beta-blockers, by decreasing myocardial oxygen requirements, exhibit marked anti-ischemic properties. beta-Blockers without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity ef...
