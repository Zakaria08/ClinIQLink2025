It employs excimer laser to ablate outer layer of cornea, epithelium, as well its connective tissue, stroma, to correct eye optical power. Laser Assisted Sub-Epithelium Keratomileusis (LASEK) is a procedure that also changes the shape of the cornea using an excimer laser to ablate the tissue from the corneal stroma, under the corneal epithelium, which is kept mostly intact to act as a natural bandage. The surgeon uses an alcohol solution to loosen then lift a thin layer of the epithelium with a trephine blade (usually with a thickness of 50 micrometres). During the weeks following LASEK, the epithelium heals, leaving no permanent flap in the cornea. This healing process can involve discomfort comparable to that with PRK.",

Histologically the time-course of wound healing could be schematically divided into three phases: (1) epithelial hyperplasia, inhomogeneous new synthesis of collagen fibrils subepithelially; (2) reorganization of the epithelium, hyperplasia of keratocytes, incipient reorganization of the collagen fibrils, increase in subepithelial haze; (3) reorganization of the collagen fibrils, decrease in subepithelial haze.

        "content": "while the peak power is Surface ablation of the cornea for several types of eye refractive surgery is now common, using an excimer laser system (LASIK and LASEK). Since the cornea does not grow back, laser is used to remodel the cornea refractive properties to correct refraction errors, such as astigmatism, myopia, and hyperopia. Laser ablation is also used to remove part of the uterine wall in women with menstruation and adenomyosis problems in a process called endometrial ablation. Recently, researchers have demonstrated a successful technique for ablating subsurface tumors with minimal thermal damage to surrounding healthy tissue, by using a focused laser beam from an ultra-short pulse diode laser source.",

        "title": "Corneal stromal wound healing in rabbits after 193-nm excimer laser surface ablation.",
        "content": "An argon fluoride excimer laser (193 nm) with a moving slit delivery system was used to perform anterior myopic keratomileusis in both eyes of 24 New Zealand white rabbits. Rabbits were killed immediately after ablation and at intervals up to 100 days. By slit-lamp microscopy, four rabbits at day 100 exhibited four clear corneas and four corneas had central, spotty, subepithelial haze. Light and electron microscopy documented corneal healing. In the early stages a transient acellular zone in the anterior stroma appeared over a period of three weeks, followed by an increased number of fibrocytes. In the corneas with opacification, focal areas of 20-microns-thick subepithelial scarring were present. An unexpected finding was transient damage to posterior stromal keratocytes and endothelial cells. The endothelium produced a layer of granular material that migrated anteriorly across Descemet's membrane. Immunochemistry at day 6 showed a marked staining for collagen IV, proteoglycans, fibronectin, and laminin.",
