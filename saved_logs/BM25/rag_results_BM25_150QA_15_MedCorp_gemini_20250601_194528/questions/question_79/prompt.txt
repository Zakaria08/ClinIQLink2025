Document 1 (Title: Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society): UHMS approved Indications: The following indications are approved uses of hyperbaric oxygen therapy as defined by the Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy Committee. Air or gas embolism Carbon monoxide poisoning Carbon Monoxide Poisoning Complicated by Cyanide Poisoning Central retinal artery occlusion Clostridal Myositis and Myonecrosis (Gas gangrene) Crush Injury, Compartment syndrome, and other Acute Traumatic Ischemias Decompression sickness Enhancement of Healing in Selected Problem Wounds Exceptional Blood Loss (Anemia) Intracranial Abscess Necrotizing Soft Tissue Infections (Necrotizing fasciitis) Osteomyelitis (Refractory) Delayed Radiation Injury (Soft Tissue and Bony Necrosis) Skin Grafts & Flaps (Compromised) Sudden Sensorineural Hearing Loss Thermal Burns
Document 2 (Title: Necrotizing fasciitis): Add on therapy Hyperbaric oxygen: While human and animal studies have shown that high oxygen tension in tissues helps to reduce edema, stimulate fibroblast growth, increase the killing ability of white blood cells, inhibit bacterial toxin release, and increase antibiotic efficacy, no high-quality trials have been shown to support or refute the use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy in patients with NSTIs. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG): No clear difference between using IVIG and placebo has been shown in the treatment of NSTIs, and one study showed serious adverse effects with IVIG use, including acute kidney injury, allergic reactions, aseptic meningitis syndrome, haemolytic anaemia, thrombi, and transmissible agents. AB103: One study assessed the efficacy of a new type of treatment that affects the immune response, called AB103. The study showed no difference in mortality with use of this therapy, but it is difficult to draw definitive conclusions due to low-quality evidence.
Document 3 (Title: Oxygen therapy): Immunological effects Hyperoxic environments have been observed to decrease granulocyte rolling and diapedesis in specific circumstances in humans. In regard to anaerobic infections, cases of necrotizing fasciitis have been observed to require fewer debridement operations and have improvement in regard to mortality in patients treated with hyperbaric oxygen therapy. This may stem from oxygen intolerance of otherwise anaerobic microorganisms. Oxidative Stress Sustained exposure to oxygen may overwhelm the body's capacity to deal with oxidative stress. Rates of oxidative stress appears to be influenced by both oxygen concentration and length of exposure, with general toxicity observed to occur within hours in certain hyperoxic conditions.
Document 4 (Title: Necrotizing fasciitis): the skin (due to the necrosis of the underlying nerves). Rapid progression to shock despite antibiotic therapy is another indication of necrotizing fasciitis. Necrotizing changes affecting the groin are known as Fournier gangrene.
Document 5 (Title: [Hyperbaric oxygenation in the treatment of necrotizing fasciitis].): The authors present the results of treatment provided to 11 patients with necrotizing fasciitis who were after a surgical operation and after administration of antibiotics treated in a hyperbaric chamber. A total of 8 patients (82%) recovered completely. The authors discuss the theory of action of hyperbaric oxygen on microorganisms and draw attention to the possible reduction of mortality of this serious disease when using hyperbaric oxygenation. The latter is considered an important auxiliary method which supplements surgical treatment, rational antibiotic therapy and in particular careful intensive care.
