        "content": "The relationships between attitudes toward oneself (self-concept) and nutrition-related behavior were examined for 153 single women aged 18 to 35 years. Nutrition-related behaviors were assessed with 3-day food records that were analyzed for nutrient composition and eating patterns (Basic Four Food Group scores, number of meals per day, and percent of energy from meals and snacks). Attitudes toward self, knowledge and attitudes about nutrition, and general health practices were assessed with a written questionnaire that incorporated several existing scales. Because of potential overlap among the three self-concept scales, as well as nutrition-attitude and health-practice items, responses were factor analyzed, yielding 14 factors. These factors were then compared with nutrient intake and eating patterns. Scores for the seemingly desirable factors of the \"Super Person\" or \"Do Your Own Thing\" were negatively correlated with intake of several nutrients; scores on the self-perception of a \"Traditional\" orientation to life were positively related to calcium intake and meal patterns. The \"Nutrition Is Important\" and \"Nutrition Knowledge\" factors were also positively related to desirable eating patterns and nutrient intakes. We conclude that several self-concept variables, as well as nutrition attitudes and knowledge, can potentially influence nutrient intakes and eating patterns in young women.",

        "content": "AIDS in the Republic of Ireland has so far mainly been associated with intravenous drug use. However, because of growing public pressure to mount an AIDS campaign aimed at potentially vulnerable sub-groups, we conducted a survey of knowledge and attitudes related to AIDS among 891 Irish schoolchildren in the senior years of secondary school. Although virtually none of the children had received any classroom education on AIDS and no national education programme had been undertaken at the time of the survey, levels of knowledge were high among the pupils studied, and compared favourably with levels found using the same questionnaire among San Franciscan pupils. Higher levels of knowledge were found among urban pupils and, although some sex differences in knowledge emerged, there was no consistent pattern in these.

The PSRI and the Sex Knowledge and Attitude Test were administered in groups to 107 professional family planning nurses and 64 senior nursing students. The major hypothesis--the more knowledge a nurse has of human sexuality, the more favorable will be her attitude toward it and the more comfortable she will be in professional situations with sexual overtones--was supported. Significant positive correlations between sexual knowledge and attitudes and written responses indicated comfort in handling sexual situations. Analyses of variance of the test scores--by age, race, marital status, religion, religiosity, frequency of church attendance, and urbanization--demonstrated areas of sexuality which might be incorporated into nursing inservice training and education.",

Multiple regression analysis revealed that students who had relatively less AIDS knowledge and who perceived greater occupational risk of HIV infection expressed stronger intentions to avoid caring for AIDS patients.

Students who held more negative attitudes toward intravenous drug users also had stronger intentions to avoid caring for AIDS patients, even when the effects of AIDS knowledge and perceived occupational risk of HIV infection were controlled.

The first phase is a needs assessment and data collection survey and it was administered during 1989. A survey was conducted throughout 9 prefectures in Japan with participation by 49 schools. Subjects were students in elementary, junior and senior high schools who ranged in age from 6 to 18 years. Participants, 12,892 in total, completed a survey on knowledge, attitude and behavior regarding cigarette smoking, alcohol drinking, diet, exercise and so on. The main results concerning cigarette smoking and alcohol drinking behavior were as follows: 1) The percentage of monthly male smokers rose remarkably from 8% in the third grade of junior high school to 37% in the third grade of senior high school, while that of female smokers showed a slow rise from 3% to 15%. The sex difference for smoking behavior was clear among senior high school students. 2) Smoking rates increased in proportion to the numbers of parents, siblings and friends who smoked. Above all, smoking behavior of friends was strongly related. Among senior high school students, for example, 50% of males and 46% of females who had two or more smoking friends were smokers, as compared to 5% of males and 2% of females with no smoking friends. 3) The percentage of monthly drinkers rose at a steady pace from 13% of males and 7% of females in the fifth grade of elementary schools to 59% of males and 50% of females in the third grade of senior high schools. The sex difference for alcohol drinking behavior among senior high school students, while statistically significant, was not as pronounced as that for smoking behavior. These results suggest that tobacco- and alcohol-use prevention programs should be introduced in elementary schools and those programs should include components relating to the social influences of parents, siblings and friends.",
