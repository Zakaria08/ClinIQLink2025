        "content": "A case of miliary tuberculosis associated with acute respiratory failure during pregnancy was reported. A 39-year-old, 29-week pregnant woman was admitted to our hospital with complaints of nonproductive cough and fever on June 12. On admission, her temperature was 38.2 degrees C; pulse rate was 90/min., and blood pressure was 120/76 mmHg. Physical examination revealed moist rales at right lung basis. Chest X-ray showed small nodular infiltrates in right lower lung field. Laboratory data revealed positive CRP, accelerated ESR and increased level of alpha 2-globulin. The number of T-cells was markedly decreased (14/mm3). The PPD skin test was negative, and the sputum smears for acid-fast bacilli were negative. Suspected of bacterial or viral pneumonia, the patient was treated with antibiotics (CPM, EM and CAZ), which had no effects for her. On June 16, the Chest X-ray showed infiltrates throughout bilateral lung fields, and the patient became increasingly dyspneic. On June 18, the results of arterial blood gas, analysis under room air were: PaO2 26.7 Torr, PaCO2 29.0 Torr, pH 7.505. Because of severe hypoxemia, she was intubated and placed on a volume-cycled respirator. Hydrocortisone (1000 mg, daily) was added to treatment because ARDS was suspected. Since the smears of tracheobronchial secretions showed acid-fast bacilli on June 24, she was diagnosed to have miliary tuberculosis. Then the intensive therapy with antituberculosis drugs (isoniazid 400 mg, rifampicin 450 mg, and streptomycin 1g, daily) was started. The non specific antibiotics were discontinued; hydrocortisone was tapered and stopped. The next week, she became afebrile and hypoxemia steadily improved.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "content": "A 63-year-old white woman was admitted to the hospital for bilateral total knee arthroplasty. She was given prophylactic subcutaneous heparin therapy postoperatively. Three days later, she had a brief hypotensive episode and an unexplained drop in hemoglobin level. Seven days postoperatively, she became confused and disoriented while complaining of pain in her right side and, later, under her left breast. She also had nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and a vague feeling of \"illness.\" Her condition deteriorated progressively, with blood pressure falling to 65/40 mm Hg and a temperature of 39.7 degrees C. Blood, urine, and cerebrospinal-fluid culture samples showed no evidence of infection. A diagnosis of acute adrenal insufficiency was made. Following corticosteroid therapy, the patient's condition improved markedly. Of interest in our patient was that she had had no antecedent hypotension, sepsis, fever, or surgical complications. Acute adrenal hemorrhage is often overlooked because the symptoms are attributed to other conditions, especially to sepsis. Acute adrenal hemorrhage should be suspected in any stressed patient in whom an abrupt deterioration associated with back or abdominal pain, hypotension, and unexplained fever are noted. Suspicion should be raised regarding those patients who are receiving anticoagulant therapy (including subcutaneous heparin prophylaxis) at the time of deterioration. With increased awareness, more cases of acute bilateral adrenal hemorrhage and subsequent adrenal insufficiency can be recognized ante mortem and treated.",

Patients experiencing a massive hepatic insult due to acetaminophen (APAP) may recover with minimal residual complications or develop fulminant hepatic necrosis. We report 3 patients with hepatic failure due to an APAP overdose who received orthotopic liver transplants and survived. An 18-y-o female ingested 60 500 mg APAP tablets (30 g). She presented with tachycardia and lethargy stating that she had taken amoxipine, carbamazepine, and lorazepam. She began to recover but on day 2 experienced an upper gastrointestinal bleed and became hypotensive and hyperpyrexic. She developed hepatic encephalopathy and it was then determined she had ingested APAP. Her APAP level was 13 micrograms/ml 96 h post-ingestion. She was successfully transplanted 19 d post-ingestion with recovery. A 40-y-o female was admitted for flu-like symptoms persisting for 7 d. She was jaundiced, hyperventilating and hypotensive. She admitted ingesting approximately 17 g APAP over 36 h. Her APAP level was 12.2 micrograms/ml. Her condition worsened and on day 3 she was in grade IV coma.

        "content": "A 41-year-old woman was admitted to our clinic because of an acute subdural hematoma. After an emergency operation her neurological status improved with an increase in the Glasgow Coma Scale score from 6 to 11. On the second postoperative day she developed frequent episodes of clonic convulsive seizures localized in the face and the left upper extremity, and her level of consciousness deteriorated. Next day she was transnasally intubated for respiratory management, but no mechanical ventilation was required. While she was undergoing the CT scanning 5 days after intubation, respiratory arrest and cyanosis developed all of a sudden, and her face and neck became swollen. The chest x-ray revealed a marked subcutaneous emphysema, mediastinal emphysema and bilateral pneumothorax. CT at that time showed a diffuse low density area in the right hemisphere, and a marked midline shift returned. She did not regain consciousness and died 12 days after the incident. At autopsy an ulcer was observed in the wall of the trachea, where the tip or the cuff of the transnasal tracheal tube was supposed to be present. No perforation, however, was there. Case 2: A 75-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital because of SAH. In hospital course she was also transnasally intubated and required no mechanical ventilation. When she was undergoing the CT scanning 3 days after intubation, she developed subcutaneous and mediastinal emphysema similarly to case 1. Although it is reported to be not a rare complication in patients on a mechanical ventilator, subcutaneous emphysema or pneumothorax is extremely rare in those intubated patients with spontaneous respiration. The mechanism of these complications in these cases is briefly discussed.",

        "content": "A 42-year-old primigravida woman at 34 weeks gestation was brought to the obstetric emergency department at midnight with complaints of severe headache, blurry vision, and right upper quadrant pain for the last 5 to 6 hours. She noted lower extremity edema and facial swelling that was gradually increasing. She has gestational hypertension and, 1 week ago, was prescribed labetalol 200 mg twice a day. On initial presentation, her blood pressure was 190/110 mm Hg on 2 separate occasions, 5 minutes apart. She had gained 2 kilograms since her last antenatal checkup in the clinic a week ago. The patient was diagnosed with severe preeclampsia. The senior obstetric resident ordered a loading dose of magnesium sulfate to prevent imminent seizure. The hospital protocol used an intravenous (IV) and intramuscular (IM) regimen where the patient received a 4 g IV bolus and a 10 g IM dose administered as 5 g in each buttock. The senior resident gave verbal orders for magnesium sulfate administration to the junior resident, who verbally communicated the order to the nurse.",

Pills provide her with a way to assure a smooth transition between work and the household chores. Oh! And we almost forgot Baby. Who will care for Baby? Snow White of course--since she is the only woman in the house. Finally, to assure perfect co-ordination of all these tasks, Excel sends her off to take a time management course. Snow white responds enthusiastically to all the expectations. As anticipated, she loses weight. She then becomes exhausted and collapses and is transformed into Burnt-Out Beauty.
