She had a life-long history of easy bruising and frequent epistaxis, with the diagnosis of vWD being made when she was 14 years old.

In April, 1988, in the 34th week of pregnancy, she was admitted to our clinic in order to avoid abnormal bleeding during labor. On admission, the level of factor VIII, ristocetin aggregation, and platelet retention were normal, but the bleeding time remained prolonged. The diagnosis of vWD type I was made on the normal multimeric structure. The DDAVP infusion test revealed a shortening of the bleeding time and an increase in the vWF: Ag.

She had two erythematous maculopapules (0.5 x 0.7 mm) on her thigh and ankle that resembled infected insect bites. Her hemoglobin level was 148 g/l with normal indices, and her white blood cell count was 10, 500/mm3 with many atypical lymphocytes and platelets. This report is intended to increase physicians' awareness of ehrlichiosis in foreign travelers and other patients, and suggests the need for further research to determine the prevalence and distribution of this disease.",
        "contents": "A case of human ehrlichiosis acquired in Mali: clinical and laboratory findings. We report on the clinical, epidemiologic, and laboratory characteristics of the first case of human ehrlichiosis acquired outside the United States caused by an Ehrlichia sp. other than E. sennetsu. The patient, a 24-year-old woman, presumably acquired the infection in Mali in northern Africa; the diagnosis was made when she returned to North America. The patient reported a fever and diarrhea a week before she left Mali; the diarrhea resolved, but the fever and chills continued. She also reported intermittent tingling in both hands and feet and muscle discomfort. Her temperature was 37.8 degrees C and her pulse rate was 100 per minute. She had two erythematous maculopapules (0.5 x 0.7 mm) on her thigh and ankle that resembled infected insect bites. Her hemoglobin level was 148 g/l with normal indices, and her white blood cell count was 10, 500/mm3 with many atypical lymphocytes and platelets.

She was diag-nosed with Crohn’s disease 2 years ago, and it involves her terminal ileum and proximal colon, as confirmed by colonoscopy and small bowel radiography. She was initially treated with mesalamine and budesonide with good response, but over the last 2 months, she has had a relapse of her symptoms. She is experiencing fatigue, cramping, abdominal pains, and nonbloody diarrhea up to 10 times daily, and she has had a 15-lb weight loss. She has no other significant medical or surgical his-tory. Her current medications are mesalamine 2.4 g/d and budesonide 9 mg/d. She appears thin and tired. Abdominal examination reveals tenderness without guarding in the right lower quadrant; no masses are palpable. On perianal examination, there is no tenderness, fissure, or fistula. Her laboratory data are notable for anemia and elevated C-reactive protein. What are the options for immediate",
