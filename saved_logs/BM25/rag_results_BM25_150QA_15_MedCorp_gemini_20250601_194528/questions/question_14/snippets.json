        "content": "Facial nerve neurinomas are relatively rare and most of them appear at the vertical portion of the facial nerve. Facial nerve neurinoma originated from the cerebellopontine (c-p) angle portion is less frequently reported. A 51-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital complaining of severe headache and nausea. She had had dizziness and unsteady gait for the previous two weeks. She did not complain of hearing disturbance, but otological examination revealed sensorineural deafness. She had no facial palsy. Skull x-ray showed no erosion of the internal auditory canal. Plain CT-scan revealed a large, unenhanced, low-density mass in the right c-p angle cistern. At the time of the operation, this tumor originated from the right facial nerve. Histological diagnosis of this tumor was schwannoma. After the operation, right facial nerve palsy appeared but hardness of hearing was no worse than previously. This tumor seemed to be facial nerve neurinoma in the c-p angle cistern. To the present, 121 facial nerve neurinomas have been reported in the previous literature. Facial nerve neurinomas in the c-p angle cistern, however, have only been reported in 5 cases. The most frequent symptom of facial nerve neurinoma in the temporal bone is facial nerve palsy, but that of facial nerve neurinoma in the c-p angle cistern is hearing loss, as in an acoustic neurinoma. Preoperative diagnosis of facial neurinoma in the c-p angle cistern using neurological symptoms alone is difficult. Furthermore, differential diagnosis from acoustic neurinoma in the c-p angle cistern using only skull x-rays and CT-scanning is also difficult.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "content": "Two patients suffered from acute hearing loss of the contralateral side after acoustic tumor surgery were reported. The first patient was a 42-year-old-male. He had had a right progressive hearing loss over two years and CT scan revealed a mass of 20mm in diameter in the right cerebellopontine angle. The patient noticed the contralateral hearing loss on next morning after the total removal of tumor by translabyrinthine approach. However he had no complaint of vertigo or facial palsy. An audiogram of the contralateral side just after the onset showed flat type audiogram of sensorineural hearing loss with positive recruitment. With steroid therapy for two weeks, hearing and ABR findings improved and returned to nearly normal. The second case was a 47-year-old male. The patient had chronic renal failure treated by hemodialysis. His hearing loss in the right ear had gradually decreased over two years and an acoustic tumor of 2.5cm in diameter was demonstrated by CT scan. The tumor was removed by translabyrinthine approach. Nine day after the operation, he noted total deafness in contralateral ear and vertigo. He was given steroid hormone and his hearing improved up to 68 dB. Four cases have been reported in the literature. The mechanisms of acute sensorineural hearing loss observed in these cases were discussed. The cause remained unknown, however there were some hypothesis such as the compression to the opposite brainstem, peripheral nerve or feeding vessels by tumor or brain edema after operation, and local vasospasms might be also the cause of hearing impairment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "content": "We report a sporadic case of 12 years old boy with facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD), sensorineural hearing loss and exudative angioma of bilateral retina. His hearing loss was noted at 9 years, followed by muscle weakness of his right upper extremity at 11 years. Complete neurological examination at 12 years revealed FSH type distribution of muscle weakness with high serum CK level (330 U/L), moderate sensorineural hearing loss and exudative angiomas of bilateral retina. The biopsy from biceps brachii muscle showed advanced dystrophic changes with a dense inflammatory cell infiltration predominating on perivascular distribution and type II fiber predominance. The features of infiltrating lymphocytic surface antigen seen in this case were compatible with those of FSHD rather than those of polymyositis. In the literature, the association of FSHD with hearing loss and retinal vessel abnormalities has been documented on 15 cases as an unusual form of FSHD. However, it has otherwise been noted that the associations of FSHD and hearing loss or retinal vessel abnormalities are unequivocally frequent, Whenever special attention has been made. Morphological examination with light and electron microscopies on the muscle specimen in this patient did not demonstrate any recognizable abnormality such as arterio-venous shunt or thickening of vessel wall basal lamina. However, it cannot be completely excluded that exudation around the abnormal vessel wall in the muscle may play an initial role in the pathogenesis of FSHD. Further morphological survey on vessel abnormalities may be necessary in the FSHD muscle.",
        "contents": "[A case of facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy with sensorineural hearing loss and retinal angioma]. We report a sporadic case of 12 years old boy with facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD), sensorineural hearing loss and exudative angioma of bilateral retina. His hearing loss was noted at 9 years, followed by muscle weakness of his right upper extremity at 11 years. Complete neurological examination at 12 years revealed FSH type distribution of muscle weakness with high serum CK level (330 U/L), moderate sensorineural hearing loss and exudative angiomas of bilateral retina. The biopsy from biceps brachii muscle showed advanced dystrophic changes with a dense inflammatory cell infiltration predominating on perivascular distribution and type II fiber predominance. The features of infiltrating lymphocytic surface antigen seen in this case were compatible with those of FSHD rather than those of polymyositis.

        "content": "A 46-year-old healthy man suffered from sore throat, fever and right otalgia. On the next day, he developed hoarseness and difficulty in swallowing. On the 6th day, he suffered from vertigo, nausea and vomiting associated with unsteady gait. He was admitted to the otorhinolaryngology department in our hospital and pointed out to have vesicles at his right ear. On the 13th day, he was referred to our service. On admission, no vesicles were noted at the right ear or pharynx. Neurological examination revealed mild nuchal rigidity and marked hoarseness, associated with poor elevation of soft palate and loss of pharyngeal reflex on the right side. He also had horizontal-clockwise rotatory nystagmus in primary gaze and ataxic gait. There was no hearing loss nor facial palsy. No other abnormal neurological findings were noted. The cerebrospinal fluid showed pleocytosis associated with increased protein. The viral antibody titre for herpes zoster was significantly elevated on 18th day in serum as well as in cerebrospinal fluid. Vertigo, nausea, vomiting, ataxia and difficulty in swallowing were all disappeared by the 25th day, whereas hoarseness was improved but still noted 6 months later. Among cranial nerves, trigeminal and facial nerves are the most commonly affected in patients with herpes zoster, but there have been a few reported cases of the 9th and 10th cranial nerve involvement in the literature. In these previously reported cases, all were written before the era of serological diagnosis, and herpes zoster was diagnosed by the vesicles at the ear or pharynx.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "content": "A patient, 30-year-old man, was admitted to Shinshu University Hospital with gait disturbance and numbness of both arms and legs in June 1985. General physical findings were normal except for facial asymmetry, i.e. mild right facial hemiatrophy. Blood pressure was normal and there were no signs of arteriosclerosis. Neurological examination revealed marked bilateral pyramidal tract signs, muscular weakness of all extremities predominant of the right side, spastic gait and sensory disturbance with impairment of pin prick and light touch sensation in the second and third trigeminal nerve regions and extremities of the left side, and mild loss of vibratory sense and numbness in all extremities. X-ray examination of the cervical spine and the myelogram of the spinal canal were normal. CT scan of the brain performed 3 hours after the myelography showed that the left vertebral artery extended from the left side of the medulla oblongata to the midline and distorted it by compression. MRI confirmed the findings of the CT scan. Vertebral angiography disclosed that the elongated left vertebral artery crossed the ventral aspect of the medulla oblongata. Compression of the medulla oblongata by the vertebral artery was diagnosed and neurovascular decompression was performed. About one month after the operation his spastic gait and muscular weakness were slightly improved, but these symptoms progressed thereafter. One year after operation his spastic gait was more marked than preoperatively. In many cases with dolichoectatic intracranial arteries, hypertension and arteriosclerosis have been reported to be usually associated with this condition. In other opinions dolichoectasia has been suggested to be a congenital disease, because such vessels are occasionally present in children.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
