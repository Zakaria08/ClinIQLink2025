Mebendazol and flubendazol are poorly absorbed and are effective for ascaris, oxyuriasis and trycocephalus both in adults and children. Abendazole is well absorbed and may be considered the drug of choice for ascaris and oxyuriasis at a single 400 mg dose. This drug may also be used for hydatid cyst when surgery is not possible and for cysticercosis of the nervous system. Praziquantel is useful for treatment of tenia infections and ivermectin is useful for strongyloides and trichostrongyloides. Detailed dose schedules for different parasitic diseases are given in the text.",
