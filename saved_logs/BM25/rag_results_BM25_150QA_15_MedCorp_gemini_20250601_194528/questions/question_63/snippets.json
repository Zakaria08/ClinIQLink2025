At the time, Maron was physician for the Seattle SuperSonics sports team, and sought to provide luxury primary care services similar to what he had been providing these athletes. MD²'s model included physician patient loads of 50 families, dramatically reduced compared with the conventional American patient load of about 3,000 patients per year. Advantages include very quick access to your personal physician as needed, and the ability to see doctors in any of 10 major cities at a greatly increased cost. MD² clients have insurance to cover additional services beyond primary care, but MD²'s fees cover the full costs of their services and MD² does not bill insurance.",
