Document 1 (Title: Nutrition: Micronutrient Intake, Imbalances, and Interventions -- Definition/Introduction -- Water-Soluble Vitamins): Vitamin B12 (cobalamin): Vitamin B12 is a water-soluble vitamin that is a cofactor in synthesizing DNA, fatty acids, and myelin, as well as erythropoiesis and the development of the nervous system. [7] [29] Bacteria synthesize cobalamin in the gastrointestinal tract of animals, and the host later absorbs it. Because vitamin B12 is concentrated in animal tissues, it is virtually found only in animal products such as meat, dairy, and eggs. [29] [30] The RDA of vitamin B12 for adults is 2.4 mcg/d. [31]
Document 2 (Title: Biochemistry_Lippinco): Prognosis: The prognosis for recovery is excellent. Case-Related Questions: Choose the ONE best answer. Q1. Which of the following statements about vitamin C is correct? Vitamin C is: A. a competitor of iron absorption in the intestine. B. a fat-soluble vitamin with a 3-month supply typically stored in adipose tissue. C. a coenzyme in several enzymic reactions such as the hydroxylation of proline. D. required for the cross-linking of collagen. Q2. In contrast to the microcytic anemia characteristic of iron deficiency (common in older adults), a macrocytic anemia is seen with deficiencies of vitamin B12 and/or folic acid. These vitamin deficiencies are also common in older adults. Which of the following statements concerning these vitamins is correct? A. An inability to absorb B12 results in pernicious anemia. B. Both vitamins cause changes in gene expression. C. Folic acid plays a key role in energy metabolism in most cells.
Document 3 (Title: Vitamin B12 metabolism in the fruit bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus). The induction of vitamin B12 deficiency and its effect on folate levels.): 1. Vitamin B12 metabolism was studied in bats of the species Rousettus aegyptiacus, which live on an all-fruit diet in the wild. 2. There was a wide range in values for the serum vitamin B12 concentration of newly captured bats, but bats captured in the early spring had significantly higher mean serum vitamin B12 levels than bats captured in the early autumn. 3. There was an exponential decrease in serum vitamin B12 concentration with time in captivity for bats fed on a vitamin B12-deficient, all-fruit diet; the biological half-life was 80 d in serum, 109 d in liver and 164 d in kidney. 4. The main storage organ for vitamin B12 in the bats was the liver, mean content 1067 ng vitamin B12. After 50 d, injected [57Co]cyanocobalamin had equilibrated with body vitamin B12 stores, and 17% of the retained radioactivity was present in the liver. From these results it was calculated that the total body vitamin B12 content of the bat was c. 6500 ng. 5. The biological half-life of injected [57Co]cyanocobalamin was 70--88 d and the calculated daily requirement was 50--60 ng (0-2 mug/kg body-weight per d). 6. As serum vitamin B12 levels decreased, serum folate levels increased. The erythrocyte folate concentration increased significantly after 130 d on the all-fruit diet and then decreased to the initial values after 190 d. 7. Vitamin B12 metabolism in the fruit bat is similar in many respects to that of man, but on a 'weight-for-weight' basis the bat has a 5- to 15-fold greater requirement for this vitamin. 8. Vitamin B12 deficiency may be induced fairly rapidly in fruit bats fed on an all-fruit diet.
