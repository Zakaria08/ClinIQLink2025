        "content": "In the cytosol of the cell (for example a muscle cell), the glycerol will be converted to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, which is an intermediate in the glycolysis, to get further oxidized and produce energy. However, the main steps of fatty acids catabolism occur in the mitochondria. Long chain fatty acids (more than 14 carbon) need to be converted to fatty acyl-CoA in order to pass across the mitochondria membrane. Fatty acid catabolism begins in the cytoplasm of cells as acyl-CoA synthetase uses the energy from cleavage of an ATP to catalyze the addition of coenzyme A to the fatty acid. The resulting acyl-CoA cross the mitochondria membrane and enter the process of beta oxidation. The main products of the beta oxidation pathway are acetyl-CoA (which is used in the citric acid cycle to produce energy), NADH and FADH. The process of beta oxidation requires the following enzymes: acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, enoyl-CoA hydratase, 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, and 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase.",

        "content": "Mitochondrial beta-oxidation can be used to supply acetyl coenzyme A (CoA) to 2 separate pathways, depending on which tissue oxidation occurs. In skeletal and cardiac muscle, mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation leads to substrate production for the tricarboxylic acid cycle in the form of acetyl CoA and provides adenosine triphosphate (ATP) for the myocytes. However, in hepatocytes, fatty acid oxidation provides acetyl CoA for ketone body synthesis during prolonged fasting conditions, in which glycogen stores have been depleted. Mitochondrial beta-oxidation yields 4 ATP equivalents per round of oxidation in the form of one flavin adenine dinucleotide, FAD(2H) molecule and 1 nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (reduced, NADH) molecule, as well as one acetyl CoA molecule.",

        "content": "The mitochondrial metabolism of 5-enoyl-CoAs, which are formed during the beta-oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids with double bonds extending from odd-numbered carbon atoms, was studied with mitochondrial extracts and purified enzymes of beta-oxidation. Metabolites were identified spectrophotometrically and by high performance liquid chromatography. 5-cis-Octenoyl-CoA, a putative metabolite of linolenic acid, was efficiently dehydrogenated by medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (EC 1.3.99.3) to 2-trans-5-cis-octadienoyl-CoA, which was isomerized to 3,5-octadienoyl-CoA either by mitochondrial delta 3,delta 2-enoyl-CoA isomerase (EC 5.3.3.8) or by peroxisomal trifunctional enzyme. Further isomerization of 3,5-octadienoyl-CoA to 2-trans-4-trans-octadienoyl-CoA in the presence of soluble extracts of either rat liver or rat heart mitochondria was observed and attributed to a delta 3,5,delta 2,4-dienoyl-CoA isomerase. Qualitatively similar results were obtained with 2-trans-5-trans-octadienoyl-CoA formed by dehydrogenation of 5-trans-octenoyl-CoA. 2-trans-4-trans-Octadienoyl-CoA was a substrate for NADPH-dependent 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase (EC 1.3.1.34). A soluble extract of rat liver mitochondria catalyzed the isomerization of 2-trans-5-cis-octadienoyl-CoA to 2-trans-4-trans-octadienoyl-CoA, which upon addition of NADPH, NAD+, and CoA was chain-shortened to hexanoyl-CoA, butyryl-CoA, and acetyl-CoA. Thus we conclude that odd-numbered double bonds, like even-numbered double bonds, can be reductively removed during the beta-oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids.",
