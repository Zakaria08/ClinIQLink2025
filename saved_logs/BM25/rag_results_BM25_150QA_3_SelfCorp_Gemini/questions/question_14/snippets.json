        "content": "The embryological origins of cranial structures profoundly influence their pathological susceptibilities, with neoplastic transformations often recapitulating the developmental potential of their progenitor tissues. The neural tube, derived from neuroectodermal invagination during primary neurulation, gives rise to the central nervous system, including the brain, spinal cord, and ventricular system. Surface ectoderm contributes to sensory epithelia including the crystalline lens and inner ear sensory cells, while maintaining its capacity to develop keratin-producing squamous neoplasms. The notochord, a mesodermal structure defining the embryonic axis, induces neural plate formation and later contributes to the nucleus pulposus of intervertebral discs. Neural crest cells represent a unique embryological population arising from the dorsal neural tube that undergoes extensive migration and remarkable phenotypic diversification. These pluripotent cells contribute to numerous structures including cranial sensory ganglia, autonomic ganglia, Schwann cells, melanocytes, and elements of pharyngeal arch derivatives. The predilection for neural crest-derived tissues to develop neoplastic conditions reflects their inherent developmental plasticity and migratory capacity. Tumors specifically derived from Schwann cells, which form myelin sheaths around peripheral nerves, include schwannomas and neurofibromas. Bilateral vestibular schwannomas localized to the cerebellopontine angle represent the pathognomonic feature of neurofibromatosis type 2, an autosomal dominant condition caused by mutations in the NF2 tumor suppressor gene on chromosome 22. The association of cutaneous manifestations with neurological findings in these neurocutaneous syndromes directly reflects the common neural crest origin of both peripheral nerve sheath cells and melanocytes.",

        "content": "The pressure within the renal pelvis is normally close to zero. When this pressure increases because of obstruction or reflux, the pelvis and calyces dilate. The degree of hydronephrosis that develops depends on the duration, degree, and site of the obstruction (Figure 12\u20134). The higher the obstruction, the greater the effect on the kidney. If the renal pelvis is entirely intrarenal and the obstruction is at the ureteropelvic junction, all the pressure will be exerted on the parenchyma (Klein et al., 2010). If the renal pelvis is extrarenal, only part of the pressure produced by a ureteropelvic stenosis is exerted on the parenchyma; this is because the extrarenal pelvis is embedded in fat and dilates more readily, thus \"decompressing\" the hydronephrotic left renal pelvis. Low density mass (P) in the left renal sinus had an attenuation value similar to that of water, suggesting the correct diagnosis. Unless intravenous contrast material is used, differentiation from a peripelvic cyst may be difficult. In the earlier stages, the renal pelvic musculature undergoes compensatory hypertrophy in its effort to force urine past the obstruction. Later, however, the muscle becomes stretched and atonic and decompensated. The progression of hydronephrotic atrophy is as follows (Chevalier, 2010; Rodriguez, 2004): 1. The earliest changes in the development of hydronephrosis are seen in the calyces. The end of a normal calyx is concave because of the papilla that projects into it; with increased intrapelvic pressure, the fornices become blunt and rounded. With persistence of increased intrapelvic pressure, the papilla becomes flattened, then convex (clubbed) as a result of compression enhanced by ischemic atrophy (Figure 12\u20135). The parenchyma between the calyces is affected to a lesser extent. The changes in the renal parenchyma are due to (a) compression atrophy from increased intrapelvic pressure (more accentuated with intrarenal pelves) and (b) ischemic atrophy from hemodynamic changes, mainly manifested in arcuate vessels that run at the base of the pyramids parallel to the kidney outline and are more vulnerable to compression between the renal capsule and the centrally increasing intrapelvic pressure. 2. This spotty atrophy is caused by the nature of the blood supply of the kidney. The arterioles are end arteries; therefore, ischemia is most marked in the areas farthest from the interlobular arteries. As the back pressure increases, hydronephrosis progresses, with the cells nearest the main arteries exhibiting the greatest resistance. 3. This increased pressure is transmitted up the tubules. The tubules become dilated, and their cells atrophy from ischemia. It should be pointed out that a few instances of dilated renal pelves and calyces are not due to the presence of obstruction. Rarely, the renal cavities are congenitally capacious and thus simulate hydronephrosis. More commonly, hydronephrosis may occur in childhood owing to the back pressure associated with vesicoureteral reflux. If the valvular incompetence resolves (and this is common), some degree of the hydronephrotic changes may persist. These persisting changes may cause the physician to suspect the presence of obstruction, which may lead to unnecessary surgery. A radioisotope renogram to assess ureteral drainage function can be performed to determine whether organic obstruction is present. 4. Only in unilateral hydronephrosis are the advanced stages of hydronephrotic atrophy seen. Eventually, the kidney is completely destroyed and appears as a thin walled sac filled with clear fluid (water and electrolytes) or pus (Figure 12\u20136).",

        "content": "1. Vertical-Banded Gastroplasty (CPT code 43842) Vertical-banded gastroplasty was formerly one of the most common gastric restrictive procedures performed in the United States but has now been replaced by other restrictive procedures due to high rates of revisions and reoperations. In this procedure, the stomach is segmented along its vertical axis. To create a durable reinforced and rate-limiting stoma at the distal end of the pouch, a plug of stomach is removed, and a propylene collar is placed through this hole and then stapled to itself. Because the normal flow of food is preserved, metabolic complications are uncommon. Complications include esophageal reflux, dilation, or obstruction of the stoma, with the latter two requiring reoperation. Dilation of the stoma is a common reason for weight regain. Vertical-banded gastroplasty may be performed using an open or laparoscopic approach. 2. Adjustable Gastric Banding (CPT code 43770) Adjustable gastric banding involves placing a gastric band around the exterior of the stomach. The band is attached to a reservoir that is implanted subcutaneously in the rectus sheath. Injecting the reservoir with saline will alter the diameter of the gastric band; therefore, the rate-limiting stoma in the stomach can be progressively narrowed to induce greater weight loss, or expanded if complications develop. Because the stomach is not entered, the surgery and any revisions, if necessary, are relatively simple. Complications include slippage of the external band or band erosion through the gastric wall. Currently, two such devices are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for marketing in the United States. The first to receive FDA approval was the LapBand (Apollo Endosurgery). The labeled indications for Lap Band devices are as follows: \"The Lap-Band system is indicated for use in weight reduction for severely obese patients with a body mass index (BMI) of at least 40 or a BMI of at least 35 with one or more severe comorbid conditions, or those who are 100 lbs or more over their estimated ideal weight according to the 1983 Metropolitan Life Insurance Tables (use the midpoint for medium frame). It is indicated for use only in severely obese adult patients who have failed more conservative weight-reduction alternatives, such as supervised diet, exercise and behavior modification programs. Patients who elect to have this surgery must make the commitment to accept significant changes in their eating habits for the rest of their lives.\" In 2011, FDA-labelled indications for the LAP-BAND were expanded to include patients with a BMI from 30 to 34 with at least 1 obesity-related comorbid condition. The second adjustable gastric banding device was approved by the FDA through the Premarket Approval (PMA) process in September 2007, the REALIZE model (Ethicon Endosurgery, Cincinnati, OH). Labeled indications for this device are as listed below: \"The [REALIZE] device is indicated for weight reduction for morbidly obese patients and is indicated for individuals with a BMI of at least 40 kg/m2, or a BMI of at least 35 kg/m2 with one or more comorbid conditions. The band is indicated for use only in morbidly obese adult patients who have failed more conservative weight-reduction alternatives, such as supervised diet, exercise, and behavior modification programs.\" 3. Sleeve gastrectomy (CPT code 43775) A sleeve gastrectomy is an alternative approach to gastrectomy that can be performed on its own, or in combination with malabsorptive procedures (most commonly biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch). In this procedure, the greater curvature of the stomach is resected from the angle of His to the distal antrum, resulting in a stomach remnant shaped like a tube or sleeve. The pyloric sphincter is preserved, resulting in a more physiologic transit of food from the stomach to the duodenum, and avoiding the dumping syndrome (overly rapid transport of food through stomach into intestines) that is seen with distal gastrectomy. This procedure can be done by the open or laparoscopic technique. Some surgeons have proposed this as the first in a two-stage procedure for very high-risk patients. Weight loss following sleeve gastrectomy may improve a patient\u2019s overall medical status, and thus reduce the risk of a subsequent more extensive malabsorptive procedure, such as biliopancreatic diversion.",
