This parameter essentially quantifies the risk of finding a difference, effect, or association that doesn't truly exist in the population.

The significance threshold directly influences hypothesis test construction through determining critical values and rejection regions for test statistics. Importantly, the acceptance interval for the null hypothesis directly relates to the significance threshold, with narrower acceptance intervals producing higher probabilities of null hypothesis rejection. This relationship creates an inverse correlation where decreasing the acceptance interval (making the test more stringent regarding the null hypothesis) necessarily increases the significance threshold's impact on rejection probability.

        "title": "Ethylene glycol poisoning",
        "content": "Signs and symptoms Signs of ethylene glycol poisoning depend upon the time after ingestion. Symptoms usually follow a three step progression, although poisoned individuals will not always develop each stage. Stage 1 (30 minutes to 12 hours) consists of neurological and gastrointestinal symptoms and looks similar to alcohol poisoning. Poisoned individuals may appear to be intoxicated, dizzy, lacking coordination of muscle movements, drooling, depressed, and have slurred speech, seizures, abnormal eye movements, headaches, and confusion. Irritation to the stomach may cause nausea and vomiting. Also seen are excessive thirst and urination. Over time, the body metabolizes ethylene glycol into other toxins. Stage 2 (12 to 36 hours) where signs of \u201calcohol\u201d poisoning appear to resolve, underlying severe internal damage is still occurring. An elevated heart rate, hyperventilation or increased breathing effort, and dehydration may start to develop, along with high blood pressure and metabolic acidosis. These symptoms are a result of accumulation of organic acids formed by the metabolism of ethylene glycol. Additionally low calcium concentrations in the blood, overactive muscle reflexes, muscle spasms, QT interval prolongation, and congestive heart failure may occur. If untreated, death most commonly occurs during this period. Stage 3 (24 to 72 hours) kidney failure is the result of ethylene glycol poisoning. In cats, this stage occurs 12\u201324 hours after consuming antifreeze; in dogs, at 36\u201372 hours after consuming antifreeze. During this stage, severe kidney failure is developing secondary to calcium oxalate crystals forming in the kidneys. Severe lethargy, coma, depression, vomiting, seizures, drooling, and inappetence may be seen. Other symptoms include acute tubular necrosis, red blood cells in the urine, excess proteins in the urine, lower back pain, decreased or absent production of urine, elevated blood concentration of potassium, and acute kidney failure. If kidney failure occurs it is typically reversible, although weeks or months of supportive care including hemodialysis may be required before kidney function returns.",

        "title": "Pharmacological Management of Male Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms",
        "content": "Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) represents a common condition affecting more than 50% of men over age 60, with progressive prevalence increasing with advancing age. The condition leads to bothersome lower urinary tract symptoms through both static (enlargement-related) and dynamic (tone-related) mechanisms of bladder outlet obstruction. Contemporary pharmacological management targets these distinct pathophysiological components with several medication classes. Alpha-1 adrenergic receptor antagonists act on the dynamic component by blocking sympathetic stimulation of smooth muscle within the prostate and bladder neck, thereby reducing urethral resistance without affecting prostate size. These agents are classified by receptor selectivity and pharmacokinetic properties. Tamsulosin demonstrates preferential affinity for alpha-1A receptors predominantly expressed in prostatic tissue, providing rapid symptom relief with minimal effects on vascular alpha-1B receptors, thereby reducing cardiovascular adverse effects such as orthostatic hypotension. This selective receptor profile makes tamsulosin particularly suitable for elderly patients and those with concurrent cardiovascular conditions. Alternative agents with different mechanisms include 5-alpha reductase inhibitors (finasteride, dutasteride), which address the static component by preventing conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, thereby reducing prostate volume over 3-6 months. Anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin target bladder overactivity rather than outlet obstruction, but carry risk of urinary retention in men with significant BPH. Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors improve BPH symptoms through mechanisms involving nitric oxide pathways. Vasopressors like midodrine, indicated for orthostatic hypotension, have no role in BPH management and may worsen urinary symptoms through increased smooth muscle tone.",
