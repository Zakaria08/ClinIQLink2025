        "content": "Isolated third nerve palsy presents a diagnostic challenge requiring careful clinical evaluation and targeted investigation to differentiate between benign and potentially life-threatening etiologies. The oculomotor nerve innervates the levator palpebrae superioris and four extraocular muscles (medial rectus, superior rectus, inferior rectus, and inferior oblique), while also carrying parasympathetic fibers to the pupillary sphincter. The anatomical course of the nerve from brainstem to orbit creates vulnerability to compression at multiple points, with localizing value in determining the underlying pathology. Clinically, complete third nerve palsy presents with ptosis (drooping of the upper eyelid), limited adduction, supraduction, and infraduction, with the eye typically assuming a 'down and out' position due to unopposed action of the lateral rectus and superior oblique muscles. Pupillary involvement represents a critical diagnostic feature, as the superficial location of parasympathetic fibers within the nerve renders them particularly vulnerable to compression. Thus, pupil-involving third nerve palsies raise immediate concern for compressive lesions, particularly posterior communicating artery aneurysms, which require urgent vascular imaging. Advanced age, hypertension, and diabetes increase the likelihood of microvascular ischemic etiologies, though these typically spare the pupil due to relative preservation of superficial fibers. The diagnostic algorithm should be guided by the clinical presentation and patient factors. Neuroimaging constitutes the cornerstone of evaluation, with MRI providing detailed assessment of brainstem, cavernous sinus, and orbital pathology. However, in cases with pupillary involvement or other concerning features (acute onset, pain, incomplete presentation), vascular imaging, preferably with CT angiography (CTA) or MR angiography (MRA), should be performed emergently to evaluate for aneurysmal compression requiring neurosurgical intervention. Additional investigations including temporal artery biopsy for suspected giant cell arteritis or assessment of intraocular pressure for glaucoma may be appropriate in select presentations, though these etiologies rarely present as isolated third nerve palsies.",

        "title": "Orbital Manifestations of Autoimmune Thyroid Disease",
        "content": "Ophthalmopathy associated with autoimmune thyroid disorders, particularly Graves' disease, represents a complex inflammatory process affecting periorbital and orbital tissues. The fundamental pathophysiological mechanism involves activation of orbital fibroblasts by autoantibodies directed against the TSH receptor, which is expressed not only on thyroid follicular cells but also on orbital fibroblasts. Once activated, these fibroblasts differentiate into adipocytes and myofibroblasts, producing excessive amounts of glycosaminoglycans, primarily hyaluronic acid. These hydrophilic molecules accumulate within the confined space of the orbit, attracting water and causing significant tissue expansion. This expansion leads to proptosis (forward displacement of the globe), extraocular muscle dysfunction, and compression of orbital structures including nerves and blood vessels. Clinical manifestations develop through distinct but overlapping phases, beginning with an active inflammatory phase characterized by orbital pain, lid retraction, periorbital edema, and conjunctival injection. Progression to the fibrotic phase results in permanent structural changes including restrictive strabismus and compressive optic neuropathy. While historically considered secondary to hyperthyroidism, current understanding recognizes orbital disease as a distinct autoimmune process that may precede, coincide with, or follow thyroid dysfunction. Women in the perimenopausal period demonstrate particular susceptibility, with recent weight loss often paradoxically accompanying the initial hyperthyroid state. Cigarette smoking represents the strongest modifiable risk factor, increasing disease severity and reducing response to immunosuppressive therapy.",

        "title": "Ethylene glycol poisoning",
        "content": "Signs and symptoms Signs of ethylene glycol poisoning depend upon the time after ingestion. Symptoms usually follow a three step progression, although poisoned individuals will not always develop each stage. Stage 1 (30 minutes to 12 hours) consists of neurological and gastrointestinal symptoms and looks similar to alcohol poisoning. Poisoned individuals may appear to be intoxicated, dizzy, lacking coordination of muscle movements, drooling, depressed, and have slurred speech, seizures, abnormal eye movements, headaches, and confusion. Irritation to the stomach may cause nausea and vomiting. Also seen are excessive thirst and urination. Over time, the body metabolizes ethylene glycol into other toxins. Stage 2 (12 to 36 hours) where signs of \u201calcohol\u201d poisoning appear to resolve, underlying severe internal damage is still occurring. An elevated heart rate, hyperventilation or increased breathing effort, and dehydration may start to develop, along with high blood pressure and metabolic acidosis. These symptoms are a result of accumulation of organic acids formed by the metabolism of ethylene glycol. Additionally low calcium concentrations in the blood, overactive muscle reflexes, muscle spasms, QT interval prolongation, and congestive heart failure may occur. If untreated, death most commonly occurs during this period. Stage 3 (24 to 72 hours) kidney failure is the result of ethylene glycol poisoning. In cats, this stage occurs 12\u201324 hours after consuming antifreeze; in dogs, at 36\u201372 hours after consuming antifreeze. During this stage, severe kidney failure is developing secondary to calcium oxalate crystals forming in the kidneys. Severe lethargy, coma, depression, vomiting, seizures, drooling, and inappetence may be seen. Other symptoms include acute tubular necrosis, red blood cells in the urine, excess proteins in the urine, lower back pain, decreased or absent production of urine, elevated blood concentration of potassium, and acute kidney failure. If kidney failure occurs it is typically reversible, although weeks or months of supportive care including hemodialysis may be required before kidney function returns.",
