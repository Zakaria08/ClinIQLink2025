Document 1 (Title: Epidemiology of Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease): Coronary artery disease continues to represent a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, with extensive epidemiological research identifying multiple modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors contributing to its development. Tobacco exposure, particularly cigarette smoking, consistently demonstrates among the strongest modifiable risk associations, with large cohort studies documenting 2-4 fold increased relative risk in current smokers compared to never-smokers, alongside dose-dependent relationships with cumulative exposure. Lipoprotein abnormalities play central roles in atherogenesis, with elevated apolipoprotein B concentrations representing a particularly strong predictor of coronary risk regardless of corresponding LDL-cholesterol levels. This relationship reflects apolipoprotein B's presence on all atherogenic lipoprotein particles, providing superior risk prediction compared to traditional lipid measurements in multiple prospective studies. Elevated blood pressure constitutes another firmly established risk factor, with each 20 mmHg systolic or 10 mmHg diastolic increase associated with approximately doubling of cardiovascular mortality across the entire blood pressure range starting from 115/75 mmHg. More recently, lipoprotein(a) has emerged as an independent risk factor, with elevated plasma levels conferring significantly increased coronary risk through both atherogenic and prothrombotic mechanisms resistant to conventional lipid-lowering approaches. Protective factors have also been identified, with high-density lipoprotein (HDL) demonstrating inverse association with coronary risk, reflecting its crucial role in reverse cholesterol transport and various anti-inflammatory functions. However, recent intervention trials targeting HDL have emphasized that its relationship with coronary disease appears more complex than initially conceptualized, with functional characteristics potentially more important than absolute concentration measurements. These collective findings inform current risk assessment algorithms and targeted intervention strategies for primary and secondary coronary disease prevention.
Document 2 (Title: Genetic Determinants of Lipoprotein Metabolism and Vascular Disease): High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) represents a complex, heterogeneous lipoprotein fraction historically associated with cardioprotective effects, though the causal nature of this relationship has been increasingly questioned. While epidemiological studies consistently demonstrate inverse associations between HDL-C levels and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, genetic studies and therapeutic trials targeting HDL-C have yielded inconsistent results, suggesting more complex relationships than initially proposed. Mutations causing low HDL-C occur through various mechanisms, predominantly affecting apolipoprotein A-I (the principal HDL protein component), ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1, mediating cellular cholesterol efflux), lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT, catalyzing cholesterol esterification), or cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP, facilitating lipid exchange between lipoproteins). These genetic variants produce distinct HDL particle compositions beyond simply reduced cholesterol content, potentially explaining divergent clinical manifestations. Surprisingly, detailed phenotypic characterization of subjects with genetically determined low HDL-C has not consistently demonstrated the accelerated atherosclerosis predicted by epidemiological associations. Particularly compelling evidence comes from studies of ABCA1 mutation carriers (Tangier disease), who despite profoundly reduced HDL-C levels, demonstrate only modestly increased cardiovascular risk. Similarly, LCAT deficiency, while producing dramatic HDL reduction, shows inconsistent associations with premature atherosclerosis. Even apoA-I mutations, affecting the structural protein of HDL, demonstrate variable vascular phenotypes not consistently correlating with HDL-C reduction magnitude. Contemporary mechanistic research suggests HDL functionality—its capacity to promote reverse cholesterol transport, exert anti-inflammatory effects, and maintain endothelial function—may be more relevant to cardiovascular protection than absolute HDL-C concentration. This functionality appears partially independent of HDL-C levels, explaining apparent discrepancies between epidemiological associations and genetic studies. Subclinical atherosclerosis assessment through carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) measurement has been particularly informative, with multiple studies specifically examining the relationship between genetically determined low HDL-C and vascular structure. These investigations consistently demonstrate that isolated genetic causes of low HDL-C without accompanying metabolic perturbations do not significantly increase cIMT compared to controls, contradicting predictions based solely on HDL-C levels. This dissociation between HDL-C concentration and vascular phenotype has profound implications for therapeutic approaches targeting HDL, suggesting intervention efficacy may depend on functional improvements rather than simple quantitative HDL-C elevation.
Document 3 (Title: Remifentanil versus alfentanil comparative pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in healthy adult male volunteers): Background: Remifentanil is an esterase metabolized opioid with a rapid clearance. The aim of this study was to contrast the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of remifentanil and alfentanil in healthy, adult male volunteers. Methods: Ten volunteers received infusions of remifentanil and alfentanil on separate study sessions using a randomized, open label crossover design. Arterial blood samples were analyzed to determine drug blood concentrations. The electroencephalogram was employed as the measure of drug effect. The pharmacokinetics were characterized using a moment analysis, a nonlinear mixed effects model (NONMEM) population analysis, and context sensitive half time computer simulations. After processing the raw electroencephalogram to obtain the spectral edge parameter, the pharmacodynamics were characterized using an effect compartment, inhibitory maximum effect model. Results: Pharmacokinetically, the two drugs are similar in terms of steady state distribution volume (VD(SS)), but remifentanil's central clearance (CLc) is substantially greater. The NONMEM analysis population pharmacokinetic parameters for remifentanil include a CLc of 2.9 l × min⁻¹, a VDss of 21.81, and a terminal half life of 35.1 min. Corresponding NONMEM parameters for alfentanil are 0.36 l × min⁻¹, 34.11, and 94.5 min. Pharmacodynamically, the drugs are similar in terms of the time required for equilibration between blood and the effect site concentrations, as evidenced by a T₁₂k(e0) for remifentanil of 0.75 min [corrected] and 0.96 min for alfentanil. However, remifentanil is 19 times more potent than alfentanil, with an effective concentration for 50% maximal effect of 19.9 ng × ml⁻¹ versus 375.9 ng × ml⁻¹ for alfentanil. Conclusions: Compared to alfentanil, the high clearance of remifentanil, combined with its small steady state distribution volume, results in a rapid decline in blood concentration after termination of an infusion. With the exception of remifentanil's nearly 20 times greater potency (30 times if alfentanil partitioning between whole blood and plasma is considered), the drugs are pharmacodynamically similar.
