Pruritus ani is usually indicated by thickening, excoriations, and eczema of the perianal region and adjacent areas. 2. The anal opening often is the site of fissures, fistulae, and external hemorrhoids. 3. The pilonidal area may present a dimple, a sinus, or an in\ufb02amed pilonidal cyst. 2. Instruct the patient to \u201cstrain down\u201d and note whether this technique brings into view previously concealed internal hemorrhoids, polyps, or a prolapsed rectal mucosa. 3. Palpate the pilonidal area, the ischiorectal fossa, the perineum, and the perianal region before inserting the gloved finger into the anal canal. Note the presence of any concealed induration or tenderness in any of these areas. 4.",
