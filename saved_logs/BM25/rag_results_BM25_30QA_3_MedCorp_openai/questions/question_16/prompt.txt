With your own knowledge and the help of the following document:

Document 1 (Title: Obstentrics_Williams): Following uncomplicated vaginal delivery, hospitalization is seldom warranted for more than 48 hours. A woman should receive instructions concerning anticipated normal physiological puerperal changes, including lochia patterns, weight loss from diuresis, and milk let-down. She also should receive instructions concerning fever, excessive vaginal bleeding, or leg pain, swelling, or tenderness. Persistent headaches, shortness of breath, or chest pain warrant immediate concern. Hospital-stay length following labor and delivery is now regulated by federal law (Chap. 32, p. 616). Currently, the norms are hospital stays up to 48 hours following uncomplicated vaginal delivery and up to 96 hours following uncomplicated cesarean delivery (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2017; Blumenfield, 2015). Earlier hospital discharge is acceptable for appropriately selected women if they desire it .
Document 2 (Title: Rotavirus -- Treatment / Management): In a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, Guarino and colleagues tested the antiretroviral effects of orally administered human serum immunoglobulins. Ninety-eight children admitted with acute gastroenteritis were separated into a treatment and control group. Children in the treatment group received a single dose of 300 mg/kg bodyweight of human serum immunoglobulin. The results of this study showed that children who received human immunoglobulin had a statistically significant improvement in clinical condition and stool patterns when compared to the control group. The total duration of rotaviral-induced diarrhea was found to be 76 hours in the treatment group compared to 131 hours in the control group. Viral excretion and hospital stay duration were also significantly reduced in the treatment group. These findings suggest that oral administration of human serum immunoglobulins may be beneficial in the treatment of hospitalized children with rotavirus disease. [12] Additional studies indicate that treatments such as probiotics, zinc, and ondansetron may also be effective in the treatment of acute gastroenteritis. [3] Most patients presenting to an outpatient clinic or the emergency department can be discharged home safely. Adults may benefit from antiemetic medications, but these should be avoided in young children. Hospital admission may be beneficial to patients with signs or symptoms of dehydration, intractable vomiting, electrolyte disturbances, abdominal pain, ileus, renal failure, or pregnancy. [13]
Document 3 (Title: Barbiturate Toxicity -- Toxicokinetics): Ultra–short-acting barbiturates (eg, thiopental and methohexital) are given intravenously and used as anesthetics. Due to their ultra–short duration of effect, these drugs are rarely misused. [23] Short-acting and intermediate-acting barbiturates (eg, pentobarbital and secobarbital) have durations of effect of 2 to 6 hours and are used as sleeping aids and sedatives. [23] These drugs have been the most frequently misused and are the most common barbiturate agents that contribute to substance use disorder. [23] Long-acting barbiturates (eg, phenobarbital) have durations of effect of greater than 6 hours and are used as antiepileptic agents and in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal. Owing to their longer durations of effect, these agents are not misused as frequently as short- and intermediate-acting agents. [23]
