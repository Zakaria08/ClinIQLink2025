With your own knowledge and the help of the following document:

Document 1 (Title: Biochemistry, Fatty Acid Oxidation -- Fundamentals): Mitochondrial beta-oxidation can be used to supply acetyl coenzyme A (CoA) to 2 separate pathways, depending on which tissue oxidation occurs. In skeletal and cardiac muscle, mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation leads to substrate production for the tricarboxylic acid cycle in the form of acetyl CoA and provides adenosine triphosphate (ATP) for the myocytes. However, in hepatocytes, fatty acid oxidation provides acetyl CoA for ketone body synthesis during prolonged fasting conditions, in which glycogen stores have been depleted. Mitochondrial beta-oxidation yields 4 ATP equivalents per round of oxidation in the form of one flavin adenine dinucleotide, FAD(2H) molecule and 1 nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (reduced, NADH) molecule, as well as one acetyl CoA molecule.
Document 2 (Title: Biochemistry_Lippinco): 7.2. Which one of the following statements concerning dietary fat is correct? A. Coconut oil is rich in monounsaturated fats, and olive oil is rich in saturated fats. B. Fatty acids containing trans double bonds, unlike the naturally occurring cis isomers, raise high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. C. The polyunsaturated fatty acids linoleic and linolenic acids are required components. D. Triacylglycerols obtained from plants generally contain less unsaturated fatty acids than do those from animals. Correct answer = C. Humans are unable to make linoleic and linolenic fatty acids. Consequently, these fatty acids are essential in the diet. Coconut oil is rich in saturated fats, and olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fats. Trans fatty acids raise plasma levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, not high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Triacylglycerols obtained from plants generally contain more unsaturated fatty acids than do those from animals.
Document 3 (Title: Biochemistry_Lippinco): Unsaturated fatty acid β-oxidation: The oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids generates intermediates that cannot serve as substrates for 2,3-enoyl CoA hydratase (see Fig. 16.17). Consequently, additional enzymes are required. Oxidation of a double bond at an odd-numbered carbon, such as 18:1(9) (oleic acid), requires one additional enzyme, 3,2-enoyl CoA isomerase, which converts the 3-cis derivative obtained after three rounds of β-oxidation to the 2-trans derivative required by the hydratase. Oxidation of a double bond at an even-numbered carbon, such as 18:2(9,12) (linoleic acid), requires an NADPH-dependent 2,4-dienoyl CoA reductase in addition to the isomerase. [Note: Because unsaturated fatty acids are less reduced than saturated fatty acids, fewer reducing equivalents are produced by their oxidation.] 8.

Answer the following list question.
