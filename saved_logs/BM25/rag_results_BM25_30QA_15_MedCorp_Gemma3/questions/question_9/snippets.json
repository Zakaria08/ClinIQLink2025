In contrast, of the 30 who agreed to enter, only 33% focused entirely on risks, while 10% did not note potential for either benefit or risk.

This is primarily due to his deep rooted focus in homeopathy. Following Thomas Brunton's discovery that amyl nitrite could be used to treat chest pain, William Murrell experimented with the use of nitroglycerin to alleviate angina pectoris and reduce blood pressure, and showed that the accompanying headaches occurred as a result of overdose. Murrell began treating patients with small doses of GTN in 1878, and the substance was widely adopted after he published his results in The Lancet in 1879.",
