Document 1 (Title: Predicate transformer semantics): Monotonic Predicate transformers of interest (wp, wlp, and sp) are monotonic. A predicate transformer T is monotonic if and only if: This property is related to the consequence rule of Hoare logic. Strict A predicate transformer T is strict iff: For instance, wp is strict, whereas wlp is generally not. In particular, if statement S may not terminate then is satisfiable. We have Indeed, true is a valid invariant of that loop. Terminating A predicate transformer T is terminating iff: Actually, this terminology makes sense only for strict predicate transformers: indeed, is the weakest-precondition ensuring termination of S. It seems that naming this property non-aborting would be more appropriate: in total correctness, non-termination is abortion, whereas in partial correctness, it is not. Conjunctive A predicate transformer T is conjunctive iff: This is the case for , even if statement S is non-deterministic as a selection statement or a specification statement.
Document 2 (Title: Metronidazole): Preterm births Metronidazole has also been used in women to prevent preterm birth associated with bacterial vaginosis, amongst other risk factors including the presence of cervicovaginal fetal fibronectin (fFN). Metronidazole was ineffective in preventing preterm delivery in high-risk pregnant women (selected by history and a positive fFN test) and, conversely, the incidence of preterm delivery was found to be higher in women treated with metronidazole.
Document 3 (Title: Trichomonas vaginalis): Treatment Infection is treated and cured with metronidazole or tinidazole. The CDC recommends a one time dose of 2 grams of either metronidazole or tinidazole as the first-line treatment; the alternative treatment recommended is 500 milligrams of metronidazole, twice daily, for seven days if there is failure of the single-dose regimen. Medication should be prescribed to any sexual partner(s) as well because they may be asymptomatic carriers. Morphology
Document 4 (Title: Quality storyboard): Analysis of Causes: Is there a clear statement of the major cause(s) of the issue? Have you explained how the possible causes were theorized? Are data included showing how the main causes were identified? Are data displayed in such a way that the connection between the issue and the cause(s) is clear? Have you explained how the data were collected and over what time-period they were collected? Plans: Is there a complete Purpose Statement and objectives designed to move toward the purpose: Direction, measure, reference, target, time frame, and owner? Is it clear how the target was derived from the analysis? Is it clear that the actions in the plan are aimed at correcting root cause(s)? Have you indicated what alternative solutions were considered, and how they were evaluated to select the best improvement theory? Have you included a copy of the planning documents? Have you indicated whether the plan was implemented on schedule? Study:
Document 5 (Title: Progress on the CSE diagnostic study. Application of McNemar's test revisited.): The authors describe an extension of McNemar's test that can be used to compare diagnostic performance when multiple statements are obtained from computer analysis or visual interpretation of the ECG. If two or more diagnostic statements are made, by definition only one can be correct for the cases in the CSE pilot database, which were selected for single, clinically well documented, abnormalities. If one statement stood out from others as being made with the highest degree of certainty, that was accepted as the single interpretation, right or wrong. However, when two or more statements were made with the same degree of certainty and only one statement was correct, then in the previous application of McNemar's test that interpretation was given credit for being correct. In the extension of the method presented in this article, such an interpretation is given partial credit for the one correct statement and partial discredit for any incorrect statement, thereby reporting the results more properly in the sensitivity and specificity statistics for the different diagnostic categories.
Document 6 (Title: Predicate transformer semantics): Conjunctive A predicate transformer T is conjunctive iff: This is the case for , even if statement S is non-deterministic as a selection statement or a specification statement. Disjunctive A predicate transformer T is disjunctive iff: This is generally not the case of when S is non-deterministic. Indeed, consider a non-deterministic statement S choosing an arbitrary boolean. This statement is given here as the following selection statement: Then, reduces to the formula . Hence, reduces to the tautology Whereas, the formula reduces to the wrong proposition . The same counter-example can be reproduced using a specification statement (see above) instead: @
Document 7 (Title: Dangling else): Examples Concrete examples follow. C In C, the grammar reads, in part: statement = ... | selection-statement selection-statement = ... | IF ( expression ) statement | IF ( expression ) statement ELSE statement Thus, without further rules, the statement if (a) if (b) s; else s2; could ambiguously be parsed as if it were either: if (a) { if (b) s; else s2; } or: if (a) { if (b) s; } else s2; In practice in C the first tree is chosen, by associating the else with the nearest if. Avoiding the conflict in LR parsers The above example could be rewritten in the following way to remove the ambiguity : statement: open_statement | closed_statement ; open_statement: IF '(' expression ')' statement | IF '(' expression ')' closed_statement ELSE open_statement ; closed_statement: non_if_statement | IF '(' expression ')' closed_statement ELSE closed_statement ;
Document 8 (Title: Vaginitis): The following are typical treatments for trichomoniasis, bacterial vaginosis, and yeast infections: Trichomoniasis: Oral treatment with either metronidazole or tinidazole. "Sexual partner(s) should be treated simultaneously. Patients should be advised to avoid sexual intercourse for at least 1 week and until they and their partner(s) have completed treatment and follow-up." Bacterial vaginosis: The most commonly used antibiotics are metronidazole, available in both pill and gel form, and clindamycin available in both pill and cream form. Yeast infections: Local azole, in the form of ovula and cream. All agents appear to be equally effective. These anti-fungal medications, which are available in over the counter form, are generally used to treat yeast infections. Treatment may last anywhere between one, three, or seven days. Aerobic vaginitis

Document 10 (Title: Metronidazole): Metronidazole is bitter and so the liquid suspension contains metronidazole benzoate. This may require hydrolysis in the gastrointestinal tract and some sources speculate that it may be unsuitable in people with diarrhea or feeding-tubes in the duodenum or jejunum. Bacterial vaginosis Drugs of choice for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis include metronidazole and clindamycin. The treatment of choice for bacterial vaginosis in nonpregnant women include metronidazole oral twice daily for seven days, or metronidazole gel intravaginally once daily for five days, or clindamycin intravaginally at bedtime for seven days. For pregnant women, the treatment of choice is metronidazole oral three times a day for seven days. Data does not report routine treatment of male sexual partners.
Document 11 (Title: Guarded Command Language): The Guarded Command Language (GCL) is a language defined by Edsger Dijkstra for predicate transformer semantics. It combines programming concepts in a compact way, before the program is written in some practical programming language. Its simplicity makes proving the correctness of programs easier, using Hoare logic. Guarded command The guarded command is the most important element of the guarded command language. In a guarded command, just as the name says, the command is "guarded". The guard is a proposition, which must be true before the statement is executed. At the start of that statement's execution, one may assume the guard to be true. Also, if the guard is false, the statement will not be executed. The use of guarded commands makes it easier to prove the program meets the specification. The statement is often another guarded command. Syntax A guarded command is a statement of the form G → S, where G is a proposition, called the guard S is a statement
Document 12 (Title: Metronidazole): Drug interactions Alcohol Consuming alcohol while taking metronidazole has been suspected in case reports to cause a disulfiram-like reaction with effects that can include nausea, vomiting, flushing of the skin, tachycardia, and shortness of breath. People are often advised not to drink alcohol during systemic metronidazole therapy and for at least 48 hours after completion of treatment. However, some studies call into question the mechanism of the interaction of alcohol and metronidazole, and a possible central toxic serotonin reaction for the alcohol intolerance is suggested. Metronidazole is also generally thought to inhibit the liver metabolism of propylene glycol (found in some foods, medicines, and in many electronic cigarette e-liquids), thus propylene glycol may potentially have similar interaction effects with metronidazole.
Document 13 (Title: Giardiasis): The World Health Organization and Infectious Disease Society of America recommend metronidazole as first line therapy. The US CDC lists metronidazole, tinidazole, and nitazoxanide as effective first-line therapies; of these three, only nitazoxanide and tinidazole are approved for the treatment of giardiasis by the US FDA. A meta-analysis done by the Cochrane Collaboration found that compared to the standard of metronidazole, albendazole had equivalent efficacy while having fewer side effects, such as gastrointestinal or neurologic issues. Other meta-analyses have reached similar conclusions. Both medications need a five to 10 day long course; albendazole is taken once a day, while metronidazole needs to be taken three times a day. The evidence for comparing metronidazole to other alternatives such as mebendazole, tinidazole or nitazoxanide was felt to be of very low quality. While tinidazole has side effects and efficacy similar to those of metronidazole, it is administered with a
Document 14 (Title: Metronidazole): Other drug interactions Metronidazole is a moderate CYP2C9 inhibitor. CYP2C9 is an enzyme of cytochrome P450 family. Therefore, metronidazole may interact with medications metabolized by this enzyme. Examples of such medications are lomitapide, warfarin, etc. Pharmacology Mechanism of action Metronidazole is of the nitroimidazole class. It inhibits nucleic acid synthesis by forming nitroso radicals, which disrupt the DNA of microbial cells. This function only occurs when metronidazole is partially reduced, and because this reduction usually happens only in anaerobic bacteria and protozoans, it has relatively little effect upon human cells or aerobic bacteria. Pharmacokinetics
Document 15 (Title: Metronidazole): Dracunculus In the case of Dracunculus medinensis (Guinea worm), metronidazole just eases worm extraction rather than killing the worm. C. difficile colitis Initial antibiotic therapy for less-severe Clostridioides difficile infection colitis (pseudomembranous colitis) consists of metronidazole, vancomycin, or fidaxomicin by mouth. In 2017, the IDSA generally recommended vancomycin and fidaxomicin over metronidazole. Vancomycin by mouth has been shown to be more effective in treating people with severe C. difficile colitis. E. histolytica Entamoeba histolytica invasive amebiasis is treated with metronidazole for eradication, in combination with diloxanide to prevent recurrence. Although it is generally a standard treatment it is associated with some side effects.
