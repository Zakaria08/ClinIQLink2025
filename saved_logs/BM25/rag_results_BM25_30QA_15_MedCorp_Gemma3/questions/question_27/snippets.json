Most cases of CIN either remain stable or are eliminated by the person's immune system without need for intervention. However, a small percentage of cases progress to cervical cancer, typically cervical squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), if left untreated. Signs and symptoms There are no specific symptoms of CIN alone. Generally, signs and symptoms of cervical cancer include: abnormal or post-menopausal bleeding abnormal discharge changes in bladder or bowel function pelvic pain on examination abnormal appearance or palpation of cervix. HPV infection of the vulva and vagina can cause genital warts or be asymptomatic.",
