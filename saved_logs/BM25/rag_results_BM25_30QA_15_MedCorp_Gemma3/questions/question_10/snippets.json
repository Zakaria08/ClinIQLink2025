The cause of over half of the documented cases of Alice in Wonderland syndrome is unknown. Complete and partial forms of the Alice in Wonderland syndrome exist in a range of other disorders, including epilepsy, intoxicants, infectious states, fevers, and brain lesions. Furthermore, the syndrome is commonly associated with migraines, as well as the use of psychoactive drugs. It can also be the initial symptom of the Epstein\u2013Barr virus (see mononucleosis), and a relationship between the syndrome and mononucleosis has been suggested. Within this suggested relationship, Epstein\u2013Barr virus appears to be the most common cause in children, while for adults it is more commonly associated with migraines.",
