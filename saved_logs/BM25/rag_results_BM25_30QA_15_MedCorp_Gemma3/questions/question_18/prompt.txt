Document 1 (Title: Intima-media thickness): Carotid IMT has been used in many epidemiological and clinical studies and these have shown associations with several risk factors, including type 2 diabetes, familial hypercholesterolemia, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), triglycerides, rheumatoid arthritis, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and air pollution. Since the 1990s, some clinical trials of lifestyle and pharmaceutical interventions have also used carotid artery IMT as a surrogate endpoint for evaluating the regression and/or progression of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; however the appropriateness of carotid IMT in this context is uncertain. Although carotid intima-media thickness is strongly associated with atherosclerosis, thickening of the intima-media may not always be due to atherosclerosis. Intima-medial thickening is a complex process, depending on a variety of factors, including blood pressure, local hemodynamics, shear stress and circumferential tensile stress. Variations in IMT between
Document 2 (Title: Common carotid artery): Carotidynia is a syndrome marked by soreness of the carotid artery near the bifurcation. Carotid stenosis may occur in patients with atherosclerosis. The intima-media thickness of the carotid artery wall is a marker of subclinical atherosclerosis, it increases with age and with long-term exposure to particulate air pollution.

Document 4 (Title: Atheroma): increased and the highest CIMT values were noted in patients with left main coronary involvement. However, human clinical trials have been slow to provide clinical & medical evidence, partly because the asymptomatic nature of atheromata make them especially difficult to study. Promising results are found using carotid intima-media thickness scanning (CIMT can be measured by B-mode ultrasonography), B-vitamins that reduce a protein corrosive, homocysteine and that reduce neck carotid artery plaque volume and thickness, and stroke, even in late-stage disease.
Document 5 (Title: Intima-media thickness): Carotid IMT is used to detect the presence of atherosclerosis in humans and, more contentiously, to track the regression, arrest or progression of atherosclerosis. Ultrasound measurements of carotid IMT were first proposed and validated in vitro by Paolo Pignoli in 1984 and further details were subsequently published in a highly cited article. The use of IMT as a non-invasive tool to track changes in arterial walls has increased substantially since the mid-1990s. Although carotid IMT is predictive of future cardiovascular events, the usefulness of measuring change in carotid IMT over time is disputed, as meta-analyses have not found that change in carotid IMT is predictive of cardiovascular events. As such, the use of change in carotid IMT as a surrogate endpoint measure of drug efficacy in clinical trials, or in clinical management of cardiovascular disease, is debated.
Document 6 (Title: Hepatic lipase): Secretion of HDL from the liver into the circulatory system regulates the release of HL into the body's bloodstream. This is because factors that increase the release of HDL (such as fasting, leading to low levels of HDL) increases the amount of HL bound to HDL and released into the bloodstream. Another lipoprotein, ApoA-I, which increases release of HDL was shown to have a similar effect by mutating the gene that coded it. Mutated ApoA-I protein caused a decrease in HL release and thus decreased the amount of HL bound to HDL and released into the bloodstream. Clinical significance Hepatic lipase deficiency is a rare, autosomal recessive disorder that results in elevated high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol due to a mutation in the hepatic lipase gene. Clinical features are not well understood and there are no characteristic xanthomas. There is an association with a delay in atherosclerosis in an animal model.
Document 7 (Title: Intima-media thickness): thickening is a complex process, depending on a variety of factors, including blood pressure, local hemodynamics, shear stress and circumferential tensile stress. Variations in IMT between different locations (e.g. the common carotid artery, the carotid bulb and the internal carotid artery) may reflect differences in local hemodynamic forces.
Document 8 (Title: Intima-media thickness): The carotid artery is the usual site of measurement of IMT and consensus statements for carotid IMT have been published for adults and children. Often, carotid IMT is measured in three locations: in the common carotid artery (typically at one cm proximal to the flow divider), at the bifurcation, and in the internal carotid artery. IMT measurements of the far (deeper) wall, by ultrasound, are generally considered more reliable than measurements performed on the near (more superficial) wall; although measurement of both near and far wall IMT has also been advocated.
Document 9 (Title: Intima-media thickness): Measurement of IMT IMT can be measured using external ultrasound in large arteries relatively close to the skin (e.g. the carotid, brachial, radial, or femoral arteries). External ultrasound methods have the advantage of being non-invasive, comparatively low cost and convenient. Deeper internal arteries, such as the coronary arteries require special intravascular catheters employing ultrasound or optical coherence tomography to measure IMT.
Document 10 (Title: Atheroma): From human clinical trials, it has become increasingly evident that a more effective focus of treatment is slowing, stopping and even partially reversing the atheroma growth process. There are several prospective epidemiologic studies including the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study and the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS), which have supported a direct correlation of Carotid Intima-media thickness (CIMT) with myocardial infarction and stroke risk in patients without cardiovascular disease history. The ARIC Study was conducted in 15,792 individuals between 5 and 65 years of age in four different regions of the US between 1987 and 1989. The baseline CIMT was measured and measurements were repeated at 4- to 7-year intervals by carotid B mode ultrasonography in this study. An increase in CIMT was correlated with an increased risk for CAD. The CHS was initiated in 1988, and the relationship of CIMT with risk of myocardial infarction and stroke was investigated in 4,476
Document 11 (Title: IDL, VLDL, chylomicrons and atherosclerosis.): In humans with the lipoprotein lipase deficiency disorder large amounts of chylomicrons and large very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) accumulate in plasma. In spite of this, atherosclerosis does not seem to develop at an accelerated rate, suggesting that these lipoproteins do not promote atherogenesis. In humans with dysbetalipoproteinemia remnant lipoproteins (intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL) plus beta-VLDL) accumulate in plasma and these particles may therefore be the factor causing accelerated atherosclerosis in this disorder. Epidemiological studies in humans suggest that IDL or remnant lipoproteins are predictors of the severity or progression of atherosclerosis. Similar studies in the St. Thomas' Hospital rabbit strain, an animal model with genetically elevated plasma levels of VLDL, IDL and low-density lipoprotein (LDL), showed that IDL or remnant lipoproteins were better predictors of the extent of atherosclerosis than were LDL or VLDL. Studies of lipoprotein/arterial wall interactions have demonstrated that the larger the lipoprotein particle, the lower the influx into intima. Very large VLDL and chylomicrons do not seem to enter intima. Although high-density lipoprotein (HDL) enters intima faster than other lipoproteins, the small HDL particles seem to penetrate the entire arterial wall and leave via lymphatics and vasa vasorum in the outer media and adventitia. In contrast, LDL, and possibly also IDL and smaller VLDL, may only leave the intima via the lumen of the artery. In conclusion, a substantial body of evidence suggests that remnant lipoproteins (IDL and smaller VLDL) share with LDL the potential for promoting atherosclerosis, whereas very large VLDL and chylomicrons do not seem to have this effect.
Document 12 (Title: Lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase deficiency): Fish-eye Disease Lab Findings CBC: no anemia Urinalysis: no protein in the urine Blood Chemistries: normal blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (no signs of kidney failure) Lipid Panel: low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) < 10 mg/dL, elevated very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and triglycerides, high plasma unesterified cholesterol in HDL particles, and low cholesterol ester in HDL particles but normal levels in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and VLDL particles Plasma LCAT activity: decreased only in HDL particles but not LDL Genetic Findings in Fish-eye Disease Mutations in the LCAT gene, which is localized in the q21–22 region of chromosome 16, cause fish-eye disease. The mutation in the LCAT gene is homozygous for a Thr123→Ile mutation or Pro10→Leu mutation. New mutations have been identified as homozygosity for an A2205→G nucleotide substitution in exon 4 of the LCAT gene which is predicted to be the cause of an Asp131→Asn substitution.

Document 14 (Title: Endothelial lipase): Endothelial lipase is linked to potential treatment and improvement of atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is a vascular disease which is caused by arterial plaque buildup. Cholesterol, fat, calcium, and other components contribute to the formation of plaque in the blood. Plaque is detrimental to vascular heath because it narrows and stiffens the arteries, causing a lack of oxygen-rich blood flow. HDL increase serves as a treatment for atherosclerosis. The hydrolysis of HDL leads to the transportation of cholesterol to the liver. The filtration system of the liver aids in the removal of cholesterol from the body. Therefore, the cholesterol level in the plasma will decrease. Thus, endothelial lipase synthesis of HDL could provide an adequate opportunity to increase HDL levels. Data suggests that endothelial lipase inhibition should increase the plasma HDL, primarily in patients with low HDL-C levels. An increased risk of atherosclerosis is associated with low levels of HDL. Although a
Document 15 (Title: Cholesterol): When this process becomes unregulated, LDL molecules without receptors begin to appear in the blood. These LDL molecules are oxidized and taken up by macrophages, which become engorged and form foam cells. These foam cells often become trapped in the walls of blood vessels and contribute to atherosclerotic plaque formation. Differences in cholesterol homeostasis affect the development of early atherosclerosis (carotid intima-media thickness). These plaques are the main causes of heart attacks, strokes, and other serious medical problems, leading to the association of so-called LDL cholesterol (actually a lipoprotein) with "bad" cholesterol.
