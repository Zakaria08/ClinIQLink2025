Document 1 (Title: Obstentrics_Williams): Following uncomplicated vaginal delivery, hospitalization is seldom warranted for more than 48 hours. A woman should receive instructions concerning anticipated normal physiological puerperal changes, including lochia patterns, weight loss from diuresis, and milk let-down. She also should receive instructions concerning fever, excessive vaginal bleeding, or leg pain, swelling, or tenderness. Persistent headaches, shortness of breath, or chest pain warrant immediate concern. Hospital-stay length following labor and delivery is now regulated by federal law (Chap. 32, p. 616). Currently, the norms are hospital stays up to 48 hours following uncomplicated vaginal delivery and up to 96 hours following uncomplicated cesarean delivery (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2017; Blumenfield, 2015). Earlier hospital discharge is acceptable for appropriately selected women if they desire it .
Document 2 (Title: Rotavirus -- Treatment / Management): In a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, Guarino and colleagues tested the antiretroviral effects of orally administered human serum immunoglobulins. Ninety-eight children admitted with acute gastroenteritis were separated into a treatment and control group. Children in the treatment group received a single dose of 300 mg/kg bodyweight of human serum immunoglobulin. The results of this study showed that children who received human immunoglobulin had a statistically significant improvement in clinical condition and stool patterns when compared to the control group. The total duration of rotaviral-induced diarrhea was found to be 76 hours in the treatment group compared to 131 hours in the control group. Viral excretion and hospital stay duration were also significantly reduced in the treatment group. These findings suggest that oral administration of human serum immunoglobulins may be beneficial in the treatment of hospitalized children with rotavirus disease. [12] Additional studies indicate that treatments such as probiotics, zinc, and ondansetron may also be effective in the treatment of acute gastroenteritis. [3] Most patients presenting to an outpatient clinic or the emergency department can be discharged home safely. Adults may benefit from antiemetic medications, but these should be avoided in young children. Hospital admission may be beneficial to patients with signs or symptoms of dehydration, intractable vomiting, electrolyte disturbances, abdominal pain, ileus, renal failure, or pregnancy. [13]
Document 3 (Title: Barbiturate Toxicity -- Toxicokinetics): Ultra–short-acting barbiturates (eg, thiopental and methohexital) are given intravenously and used as anesthetics. Due to their ultra–short duration of effect, these drugs are rarely misused. [23] Short-acting and intermediate-acting barbiturates (eg, pentobarbital and secobarbital) have durations of effect of 2 to 6 hours and are used as sleeping aids and sedatives. [23] These drugs have been the most frequently misused and are the most common barbiturate agents that contribute to substance use disorder. [23] Long-acting barbiturates (eg, phenobarbital) have durations of effect of greater than 6 hours and are used as antiepileptic agents and in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal. Owing to their longer durations of effect, these agents are not misused as frequently as short- and intermediate-acting agents. [23]
Document 4 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): inadvertent coverage of the hypo-gastric artery if too long and the need for additional devices if too short.Advantages and Risks of Endovascular Repair. The obvi-ous advantage of an endovascular AAA repair is its minimally invasive nature. Typically, patients who undergo this procedure stay in the hospital for only 1 to 3 days, in contrast to the 5to 10-day stay required after conventional open surgical repair. In our institution, patients who have had an endovascular repair are routinely transferred to a general vascular ward from the post-anesthesia recovery unit, avoiding admission to a more costly intensive care unit.Because an abdominal incision is not necessary in endo-vascular repair, the procedure is particularly beneficial in patients with severe pulmonary disease, such as chronic obstruc-tive pulmonary disease or emphysema. Patients can sustain ade-quate breathing in the postoperative period, avoiding respiratory complications or prolonged mechanical ventilation. Because
Document 5 (Title: Lung Carcinoid Tumors -- Surgical Oncology): The advantages of VATS include a reduction in morbidity, shorter hospital stays, and faster recovery. Numerous studies have demonstrated the short-term and long-term benefits of VATS, making it the standard approach. [23] [24]
Document 6 (Title: Central Line–Associated Blood Stream Infections -- Epidemiology): CLABSIs lead to prolonged hospital stays and increase healthcare costs and mortality. An estimated 250,000 bloodstream infections occur annually, and most are related to the presence of intravascular devices. In the United States, the CLABSI rate in intensive care units (ICU) is estimated to be 0.8 per 1000 central line days. International Nosocomial Infection Control Consortium (INICC) surveillance data from January 2010 through December 2015 (703 intensive care units in 50 countries) reported a CLABSI rate of 4.1 per 1000 central line days. Many central lines are found outside the ICUs. In 1 study, 55% of ICU and 24% of non-ICU patients had central lines. However, as more patients are located outside the ICU, 70% of hospitalized patients with central venous catheters were outside the ICU. [6] In recent years, peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) have increased significantly, given some inherent advantages these devices offer. [7] Trained clinical staff can place PICC lines at the bedside with ultrasound guidance, allowing quick central venous access in ICUs and general medical wards. Since PICCs are inserted in a peripheral arm vein with the tip advanced into a central vein (cavoatrial junction or the right atrium) by definition, they are central venous catheters (See Image. Central Venous Catheterization Body Access). The rates of CLABSI associated with PICCs are statistically similar to the conventional central venous catheters (CVCs) in the hospital setting. [8] In a multicenter study of 27,289 patients, CLABSI outcomes were similar between the PICCs placed in the ICU and the general medical ward. However, the study was limited, with an overall low number of events. [9]
Document 7 (Title: Exercise-Associated Hyponatremia -- Prognosis): The majority of athletes recover from acute mild EAH within hours in the emergency care setting and do not require hospital admission. The duration of the emergency room stay after treatment with either oral or IV hypertonic saline solution has been reported between 50 and 79 minutes. [5] Severe EAH requires ward or ICU admission depending upon institutional criteria. Patients who develop exercise-associated hyponatremia encephalopathy risk significant morbidity and mortality secondary to cerebral damage from cerebral edema; the exact mortality rate is unknown. [4] [7] It is unknown whether patients with prior EAH injury are at higher risk for repeat development in the future.
Document 8 (Title: EMS Prehospital Evaluation and Treatment of Asthma in Children -- Treatment / Management): For children suffering from an asthma exacerbation, ED guidelines recommend early administration (within 1 hour of ED arrival) of systemic corticosteroids in addition to inhaled beta-2-agonists. Systemic corticosteroids work synergistically by up-regulating beta receptors in addition to their anti-inflammatory effects. Systemic corticosteroids speed patient recovery, and early administration decreases ED length-of-stay, hospitalizations, and relapse rates. For pediatric ED patients of all severities, systemic corticosteroid effects are time-dependent, with one study reporting that every 30-minute delay in their administration corresponded to a 60-minute increase in ED treatment time.
Document 9 (Title: Cognitive Deficits -- History and Physical): Delirium develops very rapidly and over a short period of time. It is mainly characterized by disturbances in cognition. Other manifestations are confusion, disorientation, excitement, and also a change in consciousness. Hallucinations and illusions may be common. It also makes processing new information and situational awareness very difficult. Its onset ranges from minutes to hours and sometimes days. However, it only lasts a few hours to weeks. It can also be accompanied by inattention, mood swings, or abnormal behaviors. There is usually an underlying medical or surgical condition causing it. Delirium during a hospital stay can result in complications and long terms stay.
Document 10 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): CI 1.17–5.43, P = 0.02).28,29 Currently, conservative management can be offered to informed patients using techniques of shared decision-making, but it is not the standard modality of management of appendicitis, except in patients with significant phobia of surgery.30 Societal costs and long-term implications of the conservative strategy have not yet been completely evaluated.Timing of Surgery. Emergent surgery is often performed in patients with appendicitis, but studies have evaluated the perfor-mance of urgent surgery (waiting less than 12 hours) in a semi-elective setting after administering antibiotics upon admission. The studies did not reveal any significant difference in outcomes, except for a slightly longer hospital stay in those undergoing urgent surgery.31-33 Currently, delaying surgery less than 12 hours is acceptable in patients with short duration of symptoms (less than 48 hours) and in nonperforated, nongangrenous appendicitis.Approach of Surgery. Numerous
Document 11 (Title: Acute Chest Syndrome -- Prognosis): When considering the pediatric population, acute chest syndrome is more likely to recur in younger children, particularly those younger than 4. [17] Several factors have been identified as predictors of repeat hospitalization in children, including a history of asthma, shortness of breath, and longer initial length of stays upon presentation and hospitalization with acute chest syndrome. Long-term complications of acute chest syndrome may include recurrent episodes of acute chest syndrome, interstitial lung disease, and pulmonary hypertension.
Document 12 (Title: Obstentrics_Williams): Traditionally, the newborn is discharged with its mother, and in most cases, maternal stay has determined that of the neonate. From 1970 to the mid-1990s, average maternal postpartum length of stay declined steadily, and many mothers were discharged before 48 hours. The World Health Organization (2014) cites a minimal stay of only 24 hours. Although it is clear that most newborns can be safely discharged within 48 hours, this is not uniformly true. For example, in more than 2.1 million neonates in Canada, Liu and associates (2000) examined readmission rates following initial neonatal discharge. As the length of hospital stay dropped from 4.2 days in 1990 to 2.7 days in 1997, the readmission rate rose from 27 to 38 per 1000. Dehydration and jaundice accounted for most of these readmissions. Using Washington state data, Malkin and coworkers (2000) found that the 28-day mortality rate was increased fourfold in newborns discharged within 30 hours of birth, and the I-year mortality rate
Document 13 (Title: Pediatrics_Nelson): Bacterial tracheitis is a rare but serious superinfection of the trachea that may follow viral croup and is most commonly caused by S. aureus. Spasmodic croup describes sudden onset of croup symptoms, usually at night, but without a significant upper respiratory tract prodrome. These episodes may be recurrent and severe but usually are of short duration. Spasmodic croup has a milder course than viral croup and responds to relatively simple therapies, such as exposure to cool or humidified air. The etiology is not well understood and may be allergic. Oral or intramuscular dexamethasone for children with mild, moderate, or severe croup reduces symptoms, the need for hospitalization, and shortens hospital stays. Dexamethasone Onset of illness Gradual Acute Acute Sudden (at night) Quality of stridor Harsh Mild Harsh Harsh Drooling, neck – ++ + – hyperextension
Document 14 (Title: Pediatrics_Nelson): B. At some point, the person recognizes that the obsessions or compulsions are excessive or unreasonable. Note: This is not required for children. C. The obsessions or compulsions cause marked distress; are time-consuming (taking >1 hour a day); or significantly interfere with a normal routine, occupational (or academic) functioning, or usual social activities or relationships. D.If another Axis I disorder is present, the content of the obsessions or compulsions is not restricted to it (e.g., preoccupation with food in the presence of an eating disorder). E. The disturbance is not due to thedirect physiologic effects of a drug of abuse, a medication, or a general medical condition. Specify the following: With poor insight: if, for most of the time during the current episode, the person does not recognize that the obsessions and compulsions are excessive or unreasonable group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal infection. Early antibiotic therapy may help treat these cases.
Document 15 (Title: Pediatric Preoperative Management -- Issues of Concern -- Ketamine): Ketamine can be administered via oral, nasal, intramuscular, and rectal routes and is an effective anxiolytic in promoting mask acceptance in pediatric patients. The intramuscular route is typically reserved for very anxious or aggressive children. The administration of ketamine at a dose of 2 mg/kg intramuscular for short surgeries like myringotomies can prolong the hospital stay. [26] It has been used at higher doses, 4 mg/kg to 12 mg/kg, intramuscularly or intravenously. Ketamine has also been shown to help with the paradoxical agitation produced by midazolam. [27] Ketamine’s side effects include sialorrhea, nystagmus, delirium, and increased post-op nausea vomiting. Concomitant midazolam is advocated to decrease side effects, while anticholinergics are used to decrease sialorrhea.
