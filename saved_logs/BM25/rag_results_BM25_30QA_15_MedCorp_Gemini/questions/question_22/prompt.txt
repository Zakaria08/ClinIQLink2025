Document 1 (Title: Chromatography -- Introduction -- Column Chromatography): This is the most commonly used type, where a column of fiberglass or steel filled with silica particles acts as a stationary phase. [1] The mobile phase is gas or liquid. In normal-phase column chromatography, a polar stationary phase separates non-polar compounds; in reversed-phase chromatography, the nonpolar stationary phase and the polar mobile phase are used. [7]
Document 2 (Title: Physiology_Levy): Fig. 16.1 illustrates action potentials found in different cardiac cells. Two main types of action potentials occur in the heart and are depicted. One type, the fast response, occurs in normal atrial and ventricular myocytes and in the specialized conducting fibers (Purkinje fibers of the heart) and is divided into five phases. The rapid upstroke of the action potential is designated phase 0. The upstroke is followed by a brief period of partial, early repolarization (phase 1) and then by a plateau (phase 2) that persists for approximately 0.1 to 0.2 second. The membrane then repolarizes (phase 3) until the resting state of polarization (phase 4) is again attained. Final repolarization (phase 3) develops more slowly than depolarization (phase 0). The other type of action potential, the slow response, occurs in the sinoatrial (SA) node, which is the natural pacemaker region of the heart, and in the atrioventricular (AV) node, which is the specialized tissue that conducts the cardiac
Document 3 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Metabolism Metabolism is the chemical transformation of a drug by the body. This modification can occur within several areas; the liver is the organ most commonly involved. Drugs are metabolized by enzymes, but enzyme systems have a finite capacity to metabolize a substrate drug. If a drug is given in a dose at which the concentration does not exceed the rate of metabolism, then the metabolic process is generally linear. If the dose exceeds the amount that can be metabolized, drug accumulation and potential toxicity may occur. Drugs are metabolized through phase I or phase II reactions. In phase I reactions, the drug is made more polar through dealkylation, hydroxylation, oxidation, and deamination. Polarity facilitates drug removal from the body. Phase II reactions, which include glucuronidation, sulfation, and acetylation, result in compounds larger and more polar than the parent drug. Both phases usually inactivate the parent drug, but some drugs are rendered more active. The
Document 4 (Title: Chromatography -- Introduction -- Stationary Phase): The stationary phase is a crucial component of chromatography that interacts with analytes as they pass through, leading to separation. Solid, liquid, or gas can be held over a supporting medium. The stationary phase interacts with various mixture components based on the polarity, affinity, size, and charge. Thus, different analytes have varying degrees of interaction with the stationary phase, leading to differential retention times and elution profiles. [1] Different types of chromatography use combinations of stationary and mobile phases to achieve separation. Refer to image 1 for the classification of chromatography.
Document 5 (Title: Chromatography -- Introduction -- Planar Chromatography): The stationary phase is spread as a thin layer on a flat surface. The sample is added as a small spot or a band over it, and the entire plane is kept in a slanting position over a liquid mobile phase. The mobile phase moves over the stationary phase due to capillary action carrying the sample, resulting in separation. When a sheet of paper is used, it is called paper chromatography. If a thin layer of absorbent material like silica, aluminum, or cellulose coated over a glass plate is used, it is called thin-layer chromatography. [5] After separation, the colorless compounds are identified using fluorescence, radioactivity, or by producing visible color. The position of each molecule is identified, and the distance traveled is measured. The retention factor or Rf value for each of the molecules is expressed, and the identification of the molecules is compared with the standard Rf. The Rf value is calculated by dividing the distance a solute travels by the distance the solvent travels. A number between 0 and 1 represents the Rf value and is affected by several factors, including the type of stationary phase, the polarity of the solvent, the temperature, and the solvent concentration. [6] Refer to image 2 (planar chromatography).
Document 6 (Title: Mass Spectrometer -- Specimen Requirements and Procedure -- Liquid Chromatography): Liquid chromatography separates samples based on interactions with the mobile and stationary phases, often depending on polarity. If a component's polarity differs from that of the mobile phase, it migrates more quickly through the chromatography column. The sample is separated into bands of individual components that can be further analyzed in mass spectrometry. [18] Other techniques used for sample preparation include electrospray ionization, which uses high voltages to separate components, and fast atom bombardment, which uses a beam to generate ions from a solid phase. [19] [20] The types of samples that can be analyzed within mass spectrometry include proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, and fatty acids. [21]
Document 7 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): Phase I reactions usually convert the parent drug to a more polar metabolite by introducing or unmasking a functional group (–OH, –NH2, –SH). Often these metabolites are inactive, although in some instances activity is only modified or even enhanced. If phase I metabolites are sufficiently polar, they may be readily excreted. However, many phase I products are not eliminated rapidly and undergo a subsequent reaction in which an endogenous substrate such as glucuronic acid, sulfuric acid, acetic acid, or an amino acid combines with the newly incorporated functional group to form a highly polar conjugate. Such conjugation or synthetic reactions are the hallmarks of phase II metabolism. A great variety of drugs undergo these sequential biotransformation reactions, although in some instances, the parent drug may already possess a functional group that may form a conjugate directly. For example, the hydrazide moiety of isoniazid is known to form an
Document 8 (Title: Chromatography -- Introduction -- Mobile Phase): The mobile phase is a liquid or gas that carries the sample and propels the compounds through the stationary phase, resulting in separation. By adjusting the composition of the mobile phase, the migration rate can be controlled, leading to efficient separation. The mobile phase can be isocratic or gradient, polar or nonpolar, based on the nature of the analyte. [4]
Document 9 (Title: Biochemistry_Lippinco): 2. Microsomal system The microsomal CYP monooxygenase system found associated with the membrane of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum (particularly in the liver) functions primarily in the detoxification of foreign compounds (xenobiotics). These include numerous drugs and such varied pollutants as petroleum products and pesticides. CYP enzymes of the microsomal system (for example, CYP3A4) can be used to hydroxylate these toxins (phase I). The purpose of these modifications is two-fold. First, it may itself activate or inactivate a drug and second, make a toxic compound more soluble, thereby facilitating its excretion in the urine or feces. Frequently, however, the new hydroxyl group will serve as a site for conjugation with a polar molecule, such as glucuronic acid (see p. 161), which will significantly increase the compound’s solubility (phase II). [Note: Polymorphisms (see p. 491) in the genes for CYP enzymes can lead to differences in drug metabolism.]
Document 10 (Title: Chromatography -- Introduction -- Ion Exchange Chromatography): This relies on the reversible interaction between charged analytes (ions) and oppositely charged groups immobilized on a solid stationary phase. This interaction allows ions to be selectively retained and then eluted from the stationary phase by manipulating the composition of the mobile phase. Cation and anion exchange resins are used in the stationary phase to isolate anionic and cationic substances, respectively. [10]
Document 11 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): All of the neuromuscular blocking drugs are highly polar compounds and inactive orally; they must be administered parenterally. A. Nondepolarizing Relaxant Drugs The rate of disappearance of a nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking drug from the blood is characterized by a rapid initial distribution phase followed by a slower elimination phase. Neuromuscular blocking drugs are highly ionized, do not readily cross cell membranes, and are not strongly bound in peripheral tissues. Therefore, their volume of distribution (80–140 mL/kg) is only slightly larger than the blood volume.
Document 12 (Title: Histology_Ross):  Golgi phase. This phase is characterized by the presence of in the multiple Golgi complexes of the spermatid. These two pairs of homologous chromosomes G1 phase G2 phase *note: prophase II, anaphase II, and telophase II are not shown ovum FIGURE 22.10 • Comparison of mitosis and meiosis in a spermatogonial cell. The two pairs of chromosomes (2n) of maternal and paternal origin are depicted in red and blue, respectively. The mitotic division produces daughter cells that are genetically identical to the parental (2n) cell. The meiotic division, which has two components, a reductional division and an equatorial division, produces a cell that has only half the number of chromosomes (n). In addition, during the chromosome pairing in prophase I of meiosis, chromosome segments are exchanged, crossing-over, creating genetic diversity. In humans, the first polar body does not divide, but it does so in other species. *Note that prophase II, anaphase II, and telophase II are not shown.
Document 13 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Drug metabolism generates compounds that are usually more polar and, hence, more readily excreted than parent drug. Metabolism takes place predominantly in the liver but can occur at other sites such as kidney, intestinal epithelium, lung, and plasma. “Phase I” metabolism involves chemical modification, most often oxidation accomplished by members of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) monooxygenase superfamily. CYPs that are especially important for drug metabolism are presented in Table 5-1, and each drug may be a substrate for one or more of these enzymes. “Phase II” metabolism involves conjugation of specific endogenous compounds to drugs or their metabolites. The enzymes aInhibitors affect the molecular pathway, and thus may affect substrate. bClinically important genetic variants described; see Table 5-2. Note: A listing of CYP substrates, inhibitors, and inducers is maintained at http://medicine .iupui.edu/flockhart/table.htm.
Document 14 (Title: Chromatography -- Introduction): Chromatography is an analytical technique used to separate a given mixture into its components. The technique is based on the principle that when a mixture and a mobile phase are allowed to flow over a stationary phase, the separation occurs based on the differential affinities of the components for these 2 phases. [1] Chromatography is a commonly used technique in clinical laboratories for diagnosing inborn carbohydrate, protein, and lipid metabolism errors. [2] The parameters quantified are vitamins, hormones, metabolites, tumor markers, and drugs in body fluids. In pharmacology, chromatography is used to estimate the purity and potency of drugs. Chromatography can analyze environmental samples for drugs, toxins, and pollutants and help discover many new biomolecules, providing insights into disease mechanisms and biomarker discovery. [1] [3] The chromatography phases refer to the stationary and mobile phases involved in the separation process.
Document 15 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Choice and Timing of Allogeneic SCT Allogeneic SCT was considered first-line CML therapy before 2000. The maturing positive experience with TKIs has now relegated its use to after first-line TKI failures. An important question is the optimal timing and sequence of TKIs and allogeneic SCT (whether allogeneic SCT should be used as secondor third-line therapy). Among patients who present with or evolve to blastic phase, combinations of chemotherapy and TKIs should be used to induce remission, followed by allogeneic SCT as soon as possible. The same applies to patients who evolve from chronic to accelerated phase. Patients with de novo accelerated-phase CML may do well with long-term TKI therapy (estimated 8-year survival rate 75%); the timing of allogeneic SCT depends on their optimal response to TKI (achievement of complete cytogenetic response). Among patients who relapse in chronic phase, the treatment sequence depends on several factors: (1) patient age and availability of
