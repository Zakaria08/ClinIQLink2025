Document 1 (Title: Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia -- Introduction): The development of BPH is characterized by stromal and epithelial cell proliferation in the prostate transition zone, which surrounds the urethra. This leads to urethral compression and bladder outflow obstruction, which can result in clinical manifestations of LUTS, urinary retention, or infections due to incomplete bladder emptying. [5] Long-term, untreated disease can lead to the development of chronic high-pressure retention (a potentially life-threatening condition) and long-term or permanent changes to the bladder detrusor muscle.
Document 2 (Title: Pathology_Robbins): Hydronephrosis refers to dilation of the renal pelvis and calyces, with accompanying atrophy of the parenchyma, caused by obstruction to the outflow of urine. The obstruction may be sudden or insidious, and it may occur at any level of the urinary tract, from the urethra to the renal pelvis. The most common causes are categorized as follows: Congenital, such as atresia of the urethra, valve formations in either the ureter or urethra, an aberrant renal artery compressing the ureter, renal ptosis with torsion, or kinking of the ureter Foreign bodies, such as calculi or sloughed necrotic papillae Proliferative lesions, such as benign prostatic hyperplasia, carcinoma of the prostate, bladder tumors (papilloma and carcinoma), contiguous malignant disease (retroperitoneal lymphoma, and carcinoma of the cervix or uterus) Inflammatory lesions, such as prostatitis, ureteritis, urethritis, and retroperitoneal fibrosis
Document 3 (Title: Hydronephrosis): The most common causes of hydronephrosis in children are anatomical abnormalities. These include vesicoureteral reflux, urethral stricture, and stenosis. The most common cause of hydronephrosis in young adults is kidney stones. In older adults, the most common cause of hydronephrosis is benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH), or intrapelvic neoplasms such as prostate cancer. Compression of one or both ureters can also be caused by other developmental defects not completely occurring during the fetal stage such as an abnormally placed vein, artery, or tumor. Bilateral compression of the ureters can occur during pregnancy due to enlargement of the uterus. Changes in hormone levels during this time may also affect the muscle contractions of the bladder, further complicating this condition. Sources of obstruction that can arise from other various causes include kidney stones, blood clots or retroperitoneal fibrosis.
Document 4 (Title: Histopathology of prostatic tissue after transurethral hyperthermia.): Histopathological changes were studied in four patients who had moderate to severe urinary outflow obstruction due to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and were treated with transurethral microwave hyperthermia (TUMH). All these patients received TUMH with a helical antenna using a BSD 300 unit. The temperature was controlled on the urethral surface at 45 degrees C +/- 1 degree C. Each treatment session lasted 70 min at this temperature. Histological changes were periurethral, extending up to 6 mm radially and 4-5 cm longitudinally. They were symmetrical and most severe in the immediate periurethral zone. The severity and distribution of these histological changes correlated well with the thermal profile of the helical antenna. Acute changes, observed 24-48 h following administration of a single TUMH session, consisted of periurethral oedema, parenchymal haemorrhages and occasional, partial small-vessel thrombosis. Selective coagulation necrosis of the parenchymal smooth muscles with sparing of smooth muscle fibres in the vessel walls was noted. Histopathological changes found in patients 7 or 26 days following the administration of 10 TUMH treatments given twice-weekly for 5 weeks showed more severe and deeper lesions. They consisted of interstitial haemorrhages, complete obliteration of blood vessel lumina due to thrombosis and further evidence of coagulation and haemorrhagic necrosis. Evidence of a reparative process with ingrowth of granulation tissue in various stages of organization was clearly demonstrated. The effect of TUMH on BPH-obstructed urethra is probably expressed through selective shrinking and retraction of the periurethral prostatic parenchyma due to organizing localized tissue necrosis and cicatrization. Details of this complex process will be presented.

Document 6 (Title: [Benign prostatic hyperplasia as a frequent senile disease of the male].): An adenofibromyomatous proliferation starting from the region of the periurethral glands is referred to as benign prostatic hyperplasia. It is the result of a senile endocrinopathy, which leads to a disbalance of the peripheral hormonal milieu, and of an intraglandular disturbance of the utilization of the hormone. It becomes a disease when it is followed by an increase of the vesical outlet resistance and thus by an obstructive disturbance of the voiding of the urinary bladder. The indication for operation is determined by the degree of the obstruction and its pathophysiological sequelae as well as the complaints of the patients. The conservative therapy is above all symptomatic and indicated only at the initial stage of the disease. The transurethral resection is the operative therapy of choice. In very large hyperplasias the open surgical intervention may be necessary. In inoperable patients a urethral catheter should be renounced for a suprapubic puncture cystostomy. Also after operative ectomy of a benign prostatic hyperplasia the patients may fall ill with a carcinoma of the prostatic gland. Therefore, the duty for undergoing an annual preventive medical examination remains.

Document 8 (Title: Chronic kidney disease): By anatomical location Vascular disease includes large vessel disease such as bilateral kidney artery stenosis and small vessel disease such as ischemic nephropathy, hemolytic-uremic syndrome, and vasculitis. Glomerular disease comprises a diverse group and is classified into: Primary glomerular disease such as focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and IgA nephropathy (or nephritis) Secondary glomerular disease such as diabetic nephropathy and lupus nephritis Tubulointerstitial disease includes drug- and toxin-induced chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis, and reflux nephropathy. Obstructive nephropathy, as exemplified by bilateral kidney stones and benign prostatic hyperplasia of the prostate gland. Rarely, pinworms infecting the kidney can cause obstructive nephropathy.
Document 9 (Title: Pathoma_Husain): 2. For example, cardiac myocytes undergo hypertrophy, not hyperplasia, in response to systemic hypertension (Fig. 1.1). E. Pathologic hyperplasia (e.g., endometrial hyperplasia) can progress to dysplasia and, eventually, cancer. 1. A notable exception is benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), which does not increase the risk for prostate cancer. III. ATROPHY A. A decrease in stress (e.g., decreased hormonal stimulation, disuse, or decreased nutrients/blood supply) leads to a decrease in organ size (atrophy). 1. Occurs via a decrease in the size and number of cells B. Decrease in cell number occurs via apoptosis. C. Decrease in cell size occurs via ubiquitin-proteosome degradation of the cytoskeleton and autophagy of cellular components. 1. In ubiquitin-proteosome degradation, intermediate filaments of the cytoskeleton are "tagged" with ubiquitin and destroyed by proteosomes. 2.
Document 10 (Title: Prostatic titanium urethral stents. A new treatment option for obstructive uropathy: early clinical results and indications.): An expandable titanium stent was used as an alternative to standard treatment for urinary obstruction in 20 men. Six patients had recurrent urethral strictures. Fourteen patients had obstruction secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and were considered high risk surgical candidates. Complete results with a mean follow-up of 12 months are available for 11 patients. Four of the six stricture patients are currently unobstructed. All seven of the available men with BPH are voiding well. No side effects have been related to the stents, and no encrustations or calculi have formed.
Document 11 (Title: Cold sensation and bladder instability in patients with outflow obstruction due to benign prostatic hyperplasia.): A series of 73 patients with bladder outflow obstruction caused by benign prostatic hyperplasia underwent urodynamic investigation, including the cold water test. The presence of detrusor instability was associated with a higher urethral opening pressure, maximum detrusor pressure and detrusor pressure at maximum flow. Instability was more common and more pronounced in patients with a lack of cold sensation, but there were some patients who, whilst lacking cold sensation, still possessed the cold reflex. This suggests partial denervation of the bladder or some form of altered modulation of sensory activity within the spinal cord or central nervous system. On the other hand, some of the patients lacked cold sensation but showed a stable detrusor and a high maximum cystometric capacity. This leads to the conclusion that there are different mechanisms by which the bladder reacts to outflow obstruction.
Document 12 (Title: Urethral Strictures -- History and Physical): A key difference between benign prostatic hyperplasia and urethral stricture disease is obstructed ejaculation. [8] In addition, patients with urethral strictures do not respond to typical benign prostatic hyperplasia therapy, such as alpha-blocker medications, and the weak urinary stream is relatively constant without much variation.
Document 13 (Title: Terazosin -- Administration): Terazosin is available in the US in oral capsule formulations as a hydrochloride salt, available in 1 mg, 2 mg, 5 mg, and 10 mg formulations. For the FDA-approved indications of hypertension and benign prostatic hyperplasia, the dosing route, frequency, and amount are as follows: Hypertension The initial dose is 1 mg to 10 mg orally daily, titrated upwards as needed to a maximum of 20 mg daily. Considered a second-line agent due to adverse effects, additional consideration as an agent if the patient experiences lower urinary tract symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia. [15] [16] Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia The initial dose is 1 mg to 10 mg orally at bedtime, titrated upwards as needed based upon patient response up to 20 mg daily in 1 or 2 divided doses. [17] For Non-FDA approved indications,  including medical expulsive therapy, chronic prostatitis, hyperlipidemia, urethritis, hyperhidrosis, and oligospermia:
Document 14 (Title: Rectal examination): Usage This examination may be used for the diagnosis of prostatic disorders, benign prostatic hyperplasia and the four types of prostatitis. Chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome, chronic bacterial prostatitis, acute (sudden) bacterial prostatitis, and asymptomatic inflammatory prostatitis. The DRE has a 50% specificity for benign prostatic hyperplasia. Vigorous examination of the prostate in suspected acute prostatitis can lead to seeding of septic emboli and should never be done. Its utility as a screening method for prostate cancer however is not supported by the evidence; for the evaluation of certain clinical symptoms: a male with change in urinary ability, impotence, or dysuria (blood in the urine), pain with bowel movements;
Document 15 (Title: Local microwave hyperthermia as a treatment alternative for benign prostatic hyperplasia.): It appears that the technology for local microwave application of heat to the prostate for the management of benign prostatic hyperplasia has arrived. There are a number of issues to be resolved in the coming years that will determine the role this modality will play in the overall management of men with benign prostatic hyperplasia. These issues include: transurethral versus transrectal route, hyperthermia (42 degrees C to 44 degrees C) versus thermotherapy (greater than 45 degrees C), and a proper assessment as to whether the technique is really efficacious, given the known placebo response in all studies currently available. The results with the transrectal route appear to improve patients' symptoms objectively and subjectively, without causing irreversible tissue effects. Thus, its action has been likened to alpha blockade. But, it appears that the transrectal approach is relatively inefficient because of a significant loss in microwave power with rectal cooling. A probe placed transurethrally can accurately and easily deliver the intended power to the center of the prostate, where theoretically it has its greatest effect on both the dynamic and static components of outlet obstruction. Currently, the transurethral devices described by Sapozink and Devonec will produce histologic necrosis. The theoretical value of combining urethral heating with cooling is that it will allow treatments of greater power deeper in the prostate adenoma, but the greatest advantage over transurethral heating without cooling may be in the ability to effect a response in a single session. Finally, the placebo response is a well known phenomenon seen in all drug trials conducted for the management of benign prostatic hyperplasia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
