Document 1 (Title: Lymphocytosis -- Etiology): Infectious: Viral infections: Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV): Infectious Mononucleosis (IM) is a classic example of viral infections associated with lymphocytosis. Acute IM is a disease characterized by fever, lymphadenopathy, pharyngitis, splenomegaly, and various hematologic manifestations, among which lymphocytosis is the most common and presents in up to two-thirds of cases. [1] Cytomegalovirus (CMV): CMV can cause a disease indistinguishable from EBV IM. Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV): Although chronic HIV infection resulted in lymphopenia and decreased CD4+ lymphocytes count, primary HIV infection can lead to an acute febrile mononucleosis-like illness with associated lymphocytosis. A negative heterophile test can help distinguish the two. [2] Other Viruses: Influenza, hepatitis, mumps, measles, rubella, and human T Lymphocytic virus type 1 (HTLV-1), adenovirus, to name a few. Bacterial Infections: Most of the acute bacterial infections will cause neutrophilia; however, notable exceptions include: Bartonella henselae : Bartonella henselae leads to cat scratch disease, a disease transmitted by scratch or bite from an infected cat, that leads mostly to self-limited lymphadenopathy, but can be associated with ocular or neurologic manifestations. Lymphocytes are large and atypical. Bordetella Pertussis : Pertussis is characterized by increased lymphocytes that are small with a deeply cleaved nucleus, clinical correlation is needed to differentiate from some lymphoid malignancies that might share the morphologic appearance. Other: Brucellosis, syphilis, malaria Parasitic Infections: Toxoplasma Gondii: symptomatic  toxoplasmosis occurs most commonly in immunocompromised hosts. Lymphocytosis with atypical lymphocytes is a hematologic hallmark of the disease, that can present as a mononucleosis-like illness. [3] Other: Babesiosis Mycobacterial Tuberculosis
Document 2 (Title: Infectious mononucleosis and mononucleosis syndromes.): Infectious mononucleosis (IM) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) mononucleosis are caused by a primary infection with related viruses, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and CMV. Despite the similarity of clinical manifestations, basic differences exist: (1) The heterophil antibody (HA) response is absent in CMV mononucleosis, whereas it is present in IM. (2) In IM atypical lymphocytosis reflects proliferation of B cells early and of T cells later in the disease course; in CMV mononucleosis the situation appears complex. (3) In blood, EBV is restricted to B lymphocytes, whereas CMV is found in polymorphonuclear and mononuclear leukocytes. (4) Complications of CMV mononucleosis such as hepatitis and pneumonitis may be due to virus cytopathic effect in target organs. Prominent tonsillopharyngitis with adenopathy, and visceral complications of IM are related to lymphoproliferation which is self-limited except in males with a rare familial defect in defense against EBV. Immune complex-mediated pathology may occur in both diseases. (5) CMV is frequently transmitted to a fetus in utero or to an infant during or after birth, and this occasionally leads to severe cytomegalic inclusion disease; vertical transmission of EBV appears to be exceptional. (6) Secondary EBV infections are associated with certain malignancies whereas such an association has not been recognized in the case of CMV. Toxoplasma gondii is another cause of HA-negative mononucleosis. Its complications in the heart, in skeletal muscle and in the central nervous system are related to direct invasion by the parasite. Cellular immunity plays an important role in defense against all three agents.
Document 3 (Title: Infectious mononucleosis): Differential diagnosis About 10% of people who present a clinical picture of infectious mononucleosis do not have an acute Epstein–Barr-virus infection. A differential diagnosis of acute infectious mononucleosis needs to take into consideration acute cytomegalovirus infection and Toxoplasma gondii infections. Because their management is much the same, it is not always helpful, or possible, to distinguish between Epstein–Barr-virus mononucleosis and cytomegalovirus infection. However, in pregnant women, differentiation of mononucleosis from toxoplasmosis is important, since it is associated with significant consequences for the fetus. Acute HIV infection can mimic signs similar to those of infectious mononucleosis, and tests should be performed for pregnant women for the same reason as toxoplasmosis.
Document 4 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Differential Diagnosis Whereas ~90% of cases of IM are due to EBV, 5–10% of cases are due to cytomegalovirus (CMV) (Chap. 219). CMV is the most common cause of heterophile-negative mononucleosis; less common causes of IM and differences from IM due to EBV are shown in Table 218-2. Therapy for IM consists of supportive measures, with rest and analgesia. Excessive physical activity during the first month should be avoided to reduce the possibility of splenic rupture, which often necessitates splenectomy. Glucocorticoid therapy is not indicated for uncomplicated IM and in fact may predispose to bacterial superinfection. Prednisone (40–60 mg/d for 2–3 days, with subsequent tapering of the dose over 1–2 weeks) has been used for the prevention of airway obstruction in patients with severe tonsillar hypertrophy, for Epstein-Barr Virus Infections, Including Infectious Mononucleosis Time of symptoms
Document 5 (Title: Infectious mononucleosis): When the infection is acute (recent onset, instead of chronic), heterophile antibodies are produced. Cytomegalovirus, adenovirus and Toxoplasma gondii (toxoplasmosis) infections can cause symptoms similar to infectious mononucleosis, but a heterophile antibody test will test negative and differentiate those infections from infectious mononucleosis. Mononucleosis is sometimes accompanied by secondary cold agglutinin disease, an autoimmune disease in which abnormal circulating antibodies directed against red blood cells can lead to a form of autoimmune hemolytic anemia. The cold agglutinin detected is of anti-i specificity. Diagnosis
Document 6 (Title: Pathology_Robbins): Clinical Features. Infectious mononucleosis classically manifests with fever, sore throat, and lymphadenitis, but atypical presentations are not unusual. Sometimes there is little or no fever and only fatigue and lymphadenopathy exist, raising the specter of lymphoma; fever of unknown origin, unassociated with lymphadenopathy or other localized findings; hepatitis that is difficult to differentiate from one of the hepatotropic viral syndromes (Chapter 16); or a febrile rash resembling rubella. Ultimately, the diagnosis depends on the following, in increasing order of specificity: (1) the presence of atypical lymphocytes in the peripheral blood; (2) a positive heterophil reaction (Monospot test); and (3) a rising titer of antibodies specific for EBV antigens. In most patients, mononucleosis resolves within 4 to 6 weeks, but sometimes the fatigue lasts longer. Occasionally, one or more complications supervene. Perhaps the most common of these is hepatic dysfunction, associated with
Document 7 (Title: [Presence and significance of anticardiolipin antibodies in infectious diseases].): IgG and IgM anti-cardiolipin antibodies were measured, by an ELISA technique, in the sera of patients with B hepatitis (28), infectious mononucleosis (10), chicken pox (12), HIV infection (20), acquired toxoplasmosis (41) and other infectious diseases [HBsAg+ chronic hepatitis (5), brucellosis (6), herpes zoster (4), boutonneuse fever (3), viral pneumonitis (4), rheumatic fever (2)]. Increased levels of anti-cardiolipin antibodies (aCL), at least in one immunoglobulin class, were detected in 37 out of 135 patients [27.4%; range: 7.3% (in the patients with toxoplasmosis) -80% (in the patients with HIV infection)]. Low or medium titer aCL were present in 28 patients, high titer in 9 (6 with HIV infection, 2 with chicken pox and I with lymphoadenopathic toxoplasmosis). None of the manifestations associated with aCL was present in the aCL-positive patients. Finally, positivity for aCL didn't seem to modify the clinical picture and the prognosis of the infectious disease.
Document 8 (Title: Pathology_Robbins): Infectious mononucleosis is an acute, self-limited disease of adolescents and young adults that is caused by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a member of the herpesvirus family. The infection is characterized by (1) fever, sore throat, and generalized lymphadenitis and (2) a lymphocytosis of activated, CD8+ T cells. Of note, cytomegalovirus infection induces a similar syndrome that can be differentiated only by serologic methods.
Document 9 (Title: Pediatrics_Nelson): The characteristic triad of EBV infectious mononucleosis is fever, pharyngitis, and lymphadenopathy. The pharynx shows enlarged tonsils and exudate and, sometimes, anenanthem with pharyngeal petechiae. Lymphadenopathy ismost prominent in the anterior and posterior cervical andsubmandibular lymph nodes and less commonly involvesaxillary and inguinal lymph nodes. Other findings includesplenomegaly in 50% of cases, hepatomegaly in 10% to 20%, and maculopapular or urticarial rash in 5% to 15%. A diffuse,erythematous rash develops in approximately 80% of mononucleosis patients treated with amoxicillin. Compared with EBV infection, infectious mononucleosis-like illness caused by CMV has minimal pharyngitis and often more prominentsplenomegaly; it often presents with fever only. The mostcommon manifestation of toxoplasmosis is asymptomaticcervical lymphadenopathy, but approximately 10% of casesof acquired toxoplasmosis develop chronic posterior cervical lymphadenopathy and fatigue, usually
Document 10 (Title: Transfusion-associated cytomegalovirus mononucleosis.): Transfusion-associated cytomegalovirus mononucleosis is generally considered only as a complication of extracorporeal circulation following cardiac surgery. Three cases following trauma were recognized in less than one year. Both massive and limited volume blood transfusions were involved. Hectic fever was a characteristic feature in these otherwise remarkably asymptomatic individuals, without the classic features of heterophile-positive infectious mononucleosis. Since the illness developed several weeks into the post-operative period after extensive thoracic or abdominal trauma surgery, the presence of an undrained abscess was naturally the major diagnostic concern. Atypical lymphocytosis, markers of altered immunity (cold agglutinins, rheumatoid factor) and moderate hepatic dysfunction were important laboratory clues. In one case, focal isotope defects in the spleen scan misleadingly suggested a septic complication. A false-positive monospot test initially obscured the correct serologic diagnosis in the same patient. Failure to consider this selflimited viral infection may be a critical factor leading to unnecessary surgery. Other viral agents capable of eliciting a similar syndrome are cited.
Document 11 (Title: Lymphocytosis): Causes of absolute lymphocytosis include: acute viral infections, such as infectious mononucleosis (glandular fever), hepatitis and Cytomegalovirus infection other acute infections such as pertussis some protozoal infections, such as toxoplasmosis and American trypanosomiasis (Chagas disease) chronic intracellular bacterial infections such as tuberculosis or brucellosis chronic lymphocytic leukemia acute lymphoblastic leukemia lymphoma post-splenectomy state CARD11-related congenital B cell lymphocytosis (rare, also known as BENTA disease) Causes of relative lymphocytosis include: age less than 2 years; acute viral infections; connective tissue diseases, thyrotoxicosis, Addison's disease, splenomegaly with splenic sequestration of granulocytes.
Document 12 (Title: Pediatrics_Nelson): and, if sustained, bacterial infections. Transient lymphopenia at the beginning of illness and lasting 24 to 48 hours has been described with many viral infections. Atypical lymphocytes are mature T lymphocytes with larger, eccentrically placed, and indented nuclei classically seen with infectious mononucleosis caused by Epstein-Barr virus. Other infections associated with atypical lymphocytosis include cytomegalovirus infection, toxoplasmosis, viral hepatitis, rubella, roseola, mumps, and some drug reactions. Eosinophilia is characteristic of allergic diseases but may be seen with tissue-invasive multicellular parasites, such as the migration of the larval stages of parasites through skin, connective tissue, and viscera. High-grade eosinophilia (>30% eosinophils, or a total eosinophil count >3000/μL) frequently occurs during the muscle invasion phase
Document 13 (Title: Viral Infections of the Oral Mucosa -- Etiology -- Infectious Mononucleosis): Mononucleosis is caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV or HHV-4). The Epstein-Barr virus is associated with primary infections but also neoplastic processes. [11] The pathogenesis of mononucleosis primarily involves the infection of B-cells in the oropharyngeal mucosa, where the virus may remain latent. [8] [2] [4]
