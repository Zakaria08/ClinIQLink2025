In this report, the role of inheritance in obstructive sleep apnea was assessed by quantitating the degree of familial clustering of symptoms associated with sleep-related breathing disorders. In total, 272 subjects from 29 families identified through an index case with obstructive sleep apnea and 21 control families with no relative known to have sleep apnea were studied with questionnaires that ascertained health status and symptoms. The unadjusted odds ratios of habitual or disruptive snoring, breathing pauses, and excessive day-time sleepiness in subjects with a single relative with the same symptom were 1.40 to 1.53 (p less than 0.05). Odds ratios increased progressively for subjects with increasing numbers of symptomatic relatives). Adjustment for body mass index, age, and gender modestly reduced these odds ratios to 1.33 to 1.42.

Three groups of eight workers, engaged on three shifts in a graphic plant and matched for age and work experience, were selected according to the presence or not of complaints related to shiftwork: (1) no complaints; (2) nervous complaints (anxiety/depression, severe sleep disturbances); (3) digestive disorders (gastroduodenitis, peptic ulcer). They answered questionnaires on family conditions, health status, rigidity of sleeping habits, ability to overcome drowsiness, morningness, manifest anxiety. They also recorded several physiological parameters (oral temperature, grip strength, peak expiratory flow rate, pulse rate, sleep hours) during day and night-shifts. The data obtained indicate that the characteristics of flexibility of sleeping habits, ability to overcome drowsiness, and lower manifest anxiety, are associated with better tolerance to shiftwork. These characteristics do not seem to influence the adjustment of the circadian rhythm of oral temperature passing from day to night-shifts and vice versa. Conversely, morningness appeared to be unrelated to long-term tolerance, but did influence circadian adjustments and sleep behaviour. Among the groups, the subjects with digestive disorders showed a greater phase shift and a reduction of the amplitude on night-work, suggesting a possible relationship also between the short-term circadian adjustment and the long-term tolerance to shiftwork, as pointed out by other authors.",
