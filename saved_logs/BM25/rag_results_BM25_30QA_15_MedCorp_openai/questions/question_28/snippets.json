        "content": "Colposcopic examinations for human papillomavirus lesions were performed in 271 women, some of whom had developed concomitant cervical intraepithelial neoplasia since 1981. The colposcopic appearance was classified into one of the following categories: normal, punctate, mosaic, warty, leukoplakial, or combination, and was related to findings in Papanicolaou smears and punch biopsy specimens. There was a good correlation between the colposcopic appearance and the findings in the Papanicolaou smears and punch biopsy specimens, facilitating the diagnosis of the lesions. The accuracy of colposcopy in disclosing the atypias varied according to the growth pattern of the papillomavirus lesions, with the most accurate (100%) in cases of papillomatous condylomas, and the least accurate (50%) in the inverted lesions. White epithelium and combination patterns were most frequently associated with the papillomavirus lesions and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, as evidenced by both cytology and biopsy. During the follow-up, normal colposcopic appearance increased from 32 to 50%, reflecting the established spontaneous regression of a certain percentage of the cervical lesions, or their regression as a result of biopsy. The results are discussed in terms of the mutually complementary roles of colposcopy, cytology, and biopsy, and in view of the clinical behavior of cervical papillomavirus lesions. Colposcopy is mandatory for adequate prospective follow-up of these patients but should not replace cytology and punch biopsy.",

All were evaluated with repeat cytology and colposcopy during pregnancy and again postpartum. Colposcopic examination during pregnancy revealed a normal transformation zone without evidence of intraepithelial neoplasia in 46 women. In six of these women, repeat cytology was interpreted as cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade 1. In 30 women, an abnormal transformation zone was identified--14 with a negative repeat cytology. In five women, the transformation zone was interpreted as compatible with CIN 2 or CIN 3. Colposcopically directed biopsies were performed in 31 women, in all but two postpartum. Of the 76 women, human papilloma virus or CIN was identified on biopsy in 16 women (21%). We propose that an isolated report of atypical squamous cells on cervical cytology obtained at the initial prenatal visit does not warrant colposcopic evaluation during pregnancy, unless a repeat cytology suggests CIN. Repeat cytology and evaluation to exclude infections and inflammatory lesions is appropriate. However, if a subsequent cytology is abnormal, postpartum colposcopy and colposcopically directed biopsies seem appropriate, since the prevalence of HPV or CIN was 21%.",

The results are based on 786 colposcopies performed at 6-month intervals according to conventional methods. Colposcopic findings are categorized into one of the following patterns: normal, warty, punctate, mosaic, leukoplakia, and combination. Colposcopic pattern bore an excellent correlation to the natural history (clinical course) of the HPV lesions, in that colposcopy was normal in 75% of the regressing lesions, in 38% of the persistors, and in only 16% of the progressors. The percentage of regression increased parallel with the frequency of normal pattern during the follow-up. Leukoplakia and combination were the two most frequent (55.7%) patterns in progressor lesions, as compared with only 12.9% in regressors and in 33.2% of the persistors. The same was true of the 15 lesions progressing into carcinoma in situ (CIS), and treated by cone. In the progressor lesions, an abnormal colposcopy pattern was disclosed in 65-100%, as compared with 14-35% only in the regressors. The present study provides evidence that colposcopy is an applicable and relatively accurate diagnostic method for assessing cervical HPV lesions. Colposcopy also seems to have some prognostic value in the follow-up of these lesions, as shown by the fact that normal colposcopic pattern is frequently associated with regression, whereas leukoplakia and combination are encountered more frequently than others in HPV lesions with CIN, shown to be more prone to progress during the follow-up.",

As a part of the long-term prospective follow-up study conducted in our clinic since 1981 for women with cervical HPV (Human papillomavirus) infections (either with or without cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia, HPV-CIN and HPV-NCIN, respectively) the colposcopic data on 292 consecutive patients with a mean follow-up of 16 months are reported. The results are based on 786 colposcopies performed at 6-month intervals according to conventional methods. Colposcopic findings are categorized into one of the following patterns: normal, warty, punctate, mosaic, leukoplakia, and combination. Colposcopic pattern bore an excellent correlation to the natural history (clinical course) of the HPV lesions, in that colposcopy was normal in 75% of the regressing lesions, in 38% of the persistors, and in only 16% of the progressors. The percentage of regression increased parallel with the frequency of normal pattern during the follow-up. Leukoplakia and combination were the two most frequent (55.7%) patterns in progressor lesions, as compared with only 12.9% in regressors and in 33.2% of the persistors. The same was true of the 15 lesions progressing into carcinoma in situ (CIS), and treated by cone. In the progressor lesions, an abnormal colposcopy pattern was disclosed in 65-100%, as compared with 14-35% only in the regressors. The present study provides evidence that colposcopy is an applicable and relatively accurate diagnostic method for assessing cervical HPV lesions. Colposcopy also seems to have some prognostic value in the follow-up of these lesions, as shown by the fact that normal colposcopic pattern is frequently associated with regression, whereas leukoplakia and combination are encountered more frequently than others in HPV lesions with CIN, shown to be more prone to progress during the follow-up.",
