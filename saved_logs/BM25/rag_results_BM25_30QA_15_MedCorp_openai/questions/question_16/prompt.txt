Document 1 (Title: Can short hospital admissions be avoided? A review of admissions of less than 24 hours' duration in a paediatric teaching hospital.): To review the records of children admitted to hospital for less than 24 hours to assess the appropriateness of the admission and subsequent discharge, and the suitability of these patients for admission to a short stay area rather than the hospital wards. Retrospective study consisting of a one in three sample of all children admitted to the hospital's general medical units over one year. All admissions were listed sequentially, and every third patient was included in the study. Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne; a tertiary paediatric hospital with a major primary care role. There were a total of 660 patients eligible for inclusion in the study; 220 were selected, and all records were reviewed. It was found that although 87.7% of admissions could be justified on medical grounds alone, the children quickly recovered with at least 65% being fit for discharge within 12 hours of admission. In spite of this the mean duration of admission was 17.0 hours. The majority of patients were suffering from easily diagnosed and treated disorders, with 78.9% falling into four diagnostic groups (asthma, ingestions, infections, and convulsions). Criteria for admission to a short stay observation area were satisfied in 65% of patients (at the time of the study no such area existed in the hospital). No patients were discharged inappropriately early. A significant number of children require brief hospitalisation for relatively minor illness, but unnecessary delays caused by administrative aspects of hospital admission and relatively infrequent inpatient review by medical staff often lengthen the period of admission. Significant cost savings are possible with the use of a short stay facility, and a large number of patients are suitable for this form of care.
Document 2 (Title: Obstentrics_Williams): Following uncomplicated vaginal delivery, hospitalization is seldom warranted for more than 48 hours. A woman should receive instructions concerning anticipated normal physiological puerperal changes, including lochia patterns, weight loss from diuresis, and milk let-down. She also should receive instructions concerning fever, excessive vaginal bleeding, or leg pain, swelling, or tenderness. Persistent headaches, shortness of breath, or chest pain warrant immediate concern. Hospital-stay length following labor and delivery is now regulated by federal law (Chap. 32, p. 616). Currently, the norms are hospital stays up to 48 hours following uncomplicated vaginal delivery and up to 96 hours following uncomplicated cesarean delivery (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2017; Blumenfield, 2015). Earlier hospital discharge is acceptable for appropriately selected women if they desire it .

Document 4 (Title: Rotavirus -- Treatment / Management): In a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, Guarino and colleagues tested the antiretroviral effects of orally administered human serum immunoglobulins. Ninety-eight children admitted with acute gastroenteritis were separated into a treatment and control group. Children in the treatment group received a single dose of 300 mg/kg bodyweight of human serum immunoglobulin. The results of this study showed that children who received human immunoglobulin had a statistically significant improvement in clinical condition and stool patterns when compared to the control group. The total duration of rotaviral-induced diarrhea was found to be 76 hours in the treatment group compared to 131 hours in the control group. Viral excretion and hospital stay duration were also significantly reduced in the treatment group. These findings suggest that oral administration of human serum immunoglobulins may be beneficial in the treatment of hospitalized children with rotavirus disease. [12] Additional studies indicate that treatments such as probiotics, zinc, and ondansetron may also be effective in the treatment of acute gastroenteritis. [3] Most patients presenting to an outpatient clinic or the emergency department can be discharged home safely. Adults may benefit from antiemetic medications, but these should be avoided in young children. Hospital admission may be beneficial to patients with signs or symptoms of dehydration, intractable vomiting, electrolyte disturbances, abdominal pain, ileus, renal failure, or pregnancy. [13]
Document 5 (Title: Barbiturate Toxicity -- Toxicokinetics): Ultra–short-acting barbiturates (eg, thiopental and methohexital) are given intravenously and used as anesthetics. Due to their ultra–short duration of effect, these drugs are rarely misused. [23] Short-acting and intermediate-acting barbiturates (eg, pentobarbital and secobarbital) have durations of effect of 2 to 6 hours and are used as sleeping aids and sedatives. [23] These drugs have been the most frequently misused and are the most common barbiturate agents that contribute to substance use disorder. [23] Long-acting barbiturates (eg, phenobarbital) have durations of effect of greater than 6 hours and are used as antiepileptic agents and in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal. Owing to their longer durations of effect, these agents are not misused as frequently as short- and intermediate-acting agents. [23]
Document 6 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): inadvertent coverage of the hypo-gastric artery if too long and the need for additional devices if too short.Advantages and Risks of Endovascular Repair. The obvi-ous advantage of an endovascular AAA repair is its minimally invasive nature. Typically, patients who undergo this procedure stay in the hospital for only 1 to 3 days, in contrast to the 5to 10-day stay required after conventional open surgical repair. In our institution, patients who have had an endovascular repair are routinely transferred to a general vascular ward from the post-anesthesia recovery unit, avoiding admission to a more costly intensive care unit.Because an abdominal incision is not necessary in endo-vascular repair, the procedure is particularly beneficial in patients with severe pulmonary disease, such as chronic obstruc-tive pulmonary disease or emphysema. Patients can sustain ade-quate breathing in the postoperative period, avoiding respiratory complications or prolonged mechanical ventilation. Because
Document 7 (Title: Sheffield Children's NHS Foundation Trust): Performance In 2014 the trust was the joint best in England on the target of seeing 95% of people who attend accident and emergency departments within four hours. It achieved 97.9%. The trust put on extra consultant ward rounds at the weekend and employed extra nursing staff. A short stay unit was opened for children who needed observation for more than four hours. Senior consultants were in the emergency department from 8am to midnight. It was named by the Health Service Journal as one of the top hundred NHS trusts to work for in 2015. At that time it had 2456 full-time equivalent staff and a sickness absence rate of 4.5%. 84% of staff recommend it as a place for treatment and 68% recommended it as a place to work. Facilities The trust installed a new 3T MRI machine in 2016. It is much quieter than earlier designs and can be used while an operation is in process. It was financed by the Children's Hospital Charity. See also List of NHS trusts References
Document 8 (Title: Acute medical unit): An acute admissions unit is a short-stay department in some British, Australian and New Zealand hospitals that may be linked to the emergency department, but functions as a separate department. The AMU acts as a gateway between a patient's general practitioner, the emergency department, and the wards of the hospital. The AMU helps the emergency department produce a healthy turnaround for patients, helping with the four-hour waiting rule in the United Kingdom. An AMU is usually made up of several bays and has a small number of side-rooms and treatment rooms. They are fully equipped with emergency medical treatment facilities including defibrillators and resuscitation equipment.
Document 9 (Title: [Activity of pediatric emergency departments in 1991].): The authors report the results of a prospective survey concerning the children examined in the pediatric emergency ward of the Lenval's hospital in Nice. The study was conducted over a period of 124 days, one month of each season, and included 3,611 children. There was a majority of boys (60.8%) and children older than 7 years (56.8%). The representation of foreign children was 11.2%. Most of the consultations were decided by the parents (86%); 6.2% were sent by a general practitioner and 1.1% by a pediatrician; 6.5% were conveyed through a professional public health service transport. Traumatology was the main surgical etiology and supplied the large majority of benign cases and 23% of the emergencies. Upper respiratory and bronchopulmonary tract infections and gastroenteritis represented 70% of medical etiologies. A complementary investigation, essentially a radiological examination, was carried out in 53.6% of cases. A wound suture was performed in 13% and a plaster immobilization in 9.2% of cases. The hospitalisation's rate was 22%. Emergencies represented 1.8% of cases. A surgical intervention with general anesthesia was performed in 4.4% of cases within 12 hours following the admission. A recent law (ministerial circular: 14.05, 1991) defines the organisation and working principles of the public emergency departments in France as requiring an uninterrupted activity, a continuous medical presence and an area for very short hospitalization. This should improve the quality of the pediatric emergency wards, providing that the financial means will be available.
Document 10 (Title: Lung Carcinoid Tumors -- Surgical Oncology): The advantages of VATS include a reduction in morbidity, shorter hospital stays, and faster recovery. Numerous studies have demonstrated the short-term and long-term benefits of VATS, making it the standard approach. [23] [24]
Document 11 (Title: Central Line–Associated Blood Stream Infections -- Epidemiology): CLABSIs lead to prolonged hospital stays and increase healthcare costs and mortality. An estimated 250,000 bloodstream infections occur annually, and most are related to the presence of intravascular devices. In the United States, the CLABSI rate in intensive care units (ICU) is estimated to be 0.8 per 1000 central line days. International Nosocomial Infection Control Consortium (INICC) surveillance data from January 2010 through December 2015 (703 intensive care units in 50 countries) reported a CLABSI rate of 4.1 per 1000 central line days. Many central lines are found outside the ICUs. In 1 study, 55% of ICU and 24% of non-ICU patients had central lines. However, as more patients are located outside the ICU, 70% of hospitalized patients with central venous catheters were outside the ICU. [6] In recent years, peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) have increased significantly, given some inherent advantages these devices offer. [7] Trained clinical staff can place PICC lines at the bedside with ultrasound guidance, allowing quick central venous access in ICUs and general medical wards. Since PICCs are inserted in a peripheral arm vein with the tip advanced into a central vein (cavoatrial junction or the right atrium) by definition, they are central venous catheters (See Image. Central Venous Catheterization Body Access). The rates of CLABSI associated with PICCs are statistically similar to the conventional central venous catheters (CVCs) in the hospital setting. [8] In a multicenter study of 27,289 patients, CLABSI outcomes were similar between the PICCs placed in the ICU and the general medical ward. However, the study was limited, with an overall low number of events. [9]
Document 12 (Title: Exercise-Associated Hyponatremia -- Prognosis): The majority of athletes recover from acute mild EAH within hours in the emergency care setting and do not require hospital admission. The duration of the emergency room stay after treatment with either oral or IV hypertonic saline solution has been reported between 50 and 79 minutes. [5] Severe EAH requires ward or ICU admission depending upon institutional criteria. Patients who develop exercise-associated hyponatremia encephalopathy risk significant morbidity and mortality secondary to cerebral damage from cerebral edema; the exact mortality rate is unknown. [4] [7] It is unknown whether patients with prior EAH injury are at higher risk for repeat development in the future.
Document 13 (Title: Psychological stress, ego defenses, and cortisol production in children hospitalized for elective surgery.): This study was designed to investigate the relationship between the effectiveness of coping mechanisms and physiological indicators of distress in children faced with the experience of hospitalization and surgery. Twenty-five children between the ages of 7 and 11 were studied in the out-patient department, 2 weeks before surgery, and again during their hospital stay. Effectiveness of defenses and defense style was measured by a clinical interview and by the Rorschach test. Cortisol production rates were measured by the analysis of 24-hour urine collections at home and again in the hospital. Ward adjustment was also rated by a ward questionnaire. The results indicated no relationship between defense effectiveness and cortisol production rates in the out-patient department and an inverse relationship between cortisol production and defense effectiveness under the stress of hospitalization. Defense style was found to correlate with coping under stress. Four different groups of children emerged, suggesting four different types of reaction to the hospital experience.
Document 14 (Title: EMS Prehospital Evaluation and Treatment of Asthma in Children -- Treatment / Management): For children suffering from an asthma exacerbation, ED guidelines recommend early administration (within 1 hour of ED arrival) of systemic corticosteroids in addition to inhaled beta-2-agonists. Systemic corticosteroids work synergistically by up-regulating beta receptors in addition to their anti-inflammatory effects. Systemic corticosteroids speed patient recovery, and early administration decreases ED length-of-stay, hospitalizations, and relapse rates. For pediatric ED patients of all severities, systemic corticosteroid effects are time-dependent, with one study reporting that every 30-minute delay in their administration corresponded to a 60-minute increase in ED treatment time.
Document 15 (Title: Cognitive Deficits -- History and Physical): Delirium develops very rapidly and over a short period of time. It is mainly characterized by disturbances in cognition. Other manifestations are confusion, disorientation, excitement, and also a change in consciousness. Hallucinations and illusions may be common. It also makes processing new information and situational awareness very difficult. Its onset ranges from minutes to hours and sometimes days. However, it only lasts a few hours to weeks. It can also be accompanied by inattention, mood swings, or abnormal behaviors. There is usually an underlying medical or surgical condition causing it. Delirium during a hospital stay can result in complications and long terms stay.
