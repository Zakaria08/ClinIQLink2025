With your own knowledge and the help of the following document:

Document 1 (Title: Adjustable gastric band): Unlike more open forms of weight loss surgery (e.g. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery (RNY), Biliopancreatic diversion (BPD) and Duodenal Switch (DS)), gastric banding does not require cutting or removing any part of the digestive system. It is removable, requiring only a laparoscopic procedure to remove the band, after which the stomach usually returns to its normal pre-banded size so it is not unusual for a person to gain weight after having a band removed. However, it is not entirely reversible as adhesions and tissue scarring are inevitable. Unlike those who have procedures such as RNY, DS, or BPD, it is unusual for gastric band patients to experience any nutritional deficiencies or malabsorption of micro-nutrients. Calcium supplements and Vitamin B12 injections are not routinely required following gastric banding (as is often the case with RNY, for example). Gastric dumping syndrome issues also do not occur since intestines are not removed or re-routed.
Document 2 (Title: Effect of duodenal switch procedure on gastric acid production, intragastric pH, gastric emptying, and gastrointestinal hormones.): The duodenal switch operation preserves the pylorus and the proximal 3 to 7 cm of duodenum in continuity with the stomach while diverting pancreaticobiliary secretions. We compared it with the Roux-en-Y without vagotomy or antrectomy in 12 dogs with innervated gastric pouches. Acid secretion was inhibited between tests using ranitidine in the Roux-en-Y group only, but two of the six dogs still developed stomal ulcers and the remainder showed stomal hyperemia. This may be due to a significant increase in gastric acid output after Roux-en-Y, but gastric emptying and plasma gastrin, cholecystokinin, secretin, gastric inhibitory polypeptide, peptide YY, and neurotensin were similar after both procedures. In 12 patients and a further 6 dogs, the duodenal switch caused no significant change in the intragastric pH environment as assessed by intragastric pH monitoring. The duodenal switch is a suitable procedure for pancreaticobiliary diversion.
Document 3 (Title: Use of Roux-en-Y diversion of duodenal secretions in the treatment of reflux gastritis.): Animal experiments and clinical studies suggest that duodenal secretions may be harmful to gastric mucosa after the antrum has been resected. Reflux of duodenal secretions into the gastric remnant after operation for ulcer disease may lead to the symptom complex of reflux gastritis. The injurious agent in the duodenal secretions has yet to be identified. Its relationship to altered gastric mucosa has not been fully elucidated. Diversion of the flow of duodenal secretions away from the stomach may relieve symptoms. Of several surgical procedures used, the Roux-en-Y limb has consistently afforded the best clinical result. Presented are 15 patients who had Roux-en-Y diversion for postoperative reflux gastritis. All patients showed marked improvement after this procedure. Twelve patients also had associated esophagitis. All original procedures were for benign ulcer disease. Three of the patients, who had Henley jejunal loop interpositions, continued to have symptoms which were relieved after conversion to a Roux-en-Y limb.
Document 4 (Title: Surgical Options in the Treatment of Severe Obesity -- Issues of Concern -- Bariatric Procedures for Management of Severe Obesity): The weight loss mechanism typically falls into 1 of 2 categories, but some procedures have both components. These mechanisms include malabsorption and restriction. Neurohormonal effects contribute to the regulation of energy balance and hunger control. Key hormones include leptin and ghrelin. Examples of restrictive procedures include vertical banded gastroplasty, laparoscopic adjustable gastric band, and sleeve gastrectomy. Malabsorptive procedures include jejunoileal bypass, biliopancreatic diversion (BPD), or biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch. A combination procedure commonly performed is the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. [6]
Document 5 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): sur-gical risk,59 especially if the obesity is so severe that the patient cannot normally do self-care or would not likely be able to do so after surgery. In addition to excessive morbidity, the placement of these individuals in care facilities postoperatively for recovery is often impossible due to their size and limitations of physical ability. Finally, lack of sufficient social support or an extremely poor or unsupportive home environment can be contraindications to surgical care, since such environmental factors are important to optimize outcomes once discharged from the hospital.Brunicardi_Ch27_p1167-p1218.indd 117323/02/19 2:20 PM 1174SPECIFIC CONSIDERATIONSPART IIABCDEFGHFigure 27-5.

Document 7 (Title: Bariatric surgery): Sleeve gastrectomy with duodenal switch A variation of the biliopancreatic diversion includes a duodenal switch. The part of the stomach along its greater curve is resected. The stomach is "tubulized" with a residual volume of about 150 ml. This volume reduction provides the food intake restriction component of this operation. This type of gastric resection is anatomically and functionally irreversible. The stomach is then disconnected from the duodenum and connected to the distal part of the small intestine. The duodenum and the upper part of the small intestine are reattached to the rest at about 75–100 cm from the colon.. Like the Roux en Y Bypass, it is now understood that its results are largely due to a significant alteration in gut hormones that control hunger and satiety, in addition to its restriction and malabsorption properties. The addition of the sleeve gastrectomy, causes further gut hormone set- point alterations by reducing levels of the hunger hormone, Ghrelin.
Document 8 (Title: Gastric surgery for morbid obesity. Complications and long-term weight control.): The efficacy of gastric surgery for morbid obesity has often been questioned because of incomplete long-term patient follow-up. Between 1977 and 1984, 537 consecutive patients received either a gastric bypass with a Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy, an unbanded gastrogastrostomy, or a vertical banded gastroplasty. The follow-up period was 5 years for all patients who underwent Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy and unbanded gastrogastrostomy and 3 years for all patients who underwent vertical banded gastroplasty. Only 5.8% of all patients were unavailable for this late follow-up. The unbanded gastrogastrostomy was not an effective weight-control operation. Both the Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy and vertical banded gastroplasty provided effective long-term weight control. Although the Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy gave slightly better weight control than the vertical banded gastroplasty, the more simple, safe, and physiological vertical banded gastroplasty is the procedure of choice for most patients with morbid obesity.

Document 10 (Title: Biliopancreatic Diversion With Duodenal Switch -- Clinical Significance): Biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch is a common weight loss procedure that is gaining popularity in the US. The procedure is still not as common as sleeve gastrectomy and Roux en-Y gastric bypass. Long-term studies have displayed similar outcomes in patients with Roux en-Y gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy, and biliopancreatic bypass with duodenal switch. The main differences that have been shown are that patients who are super obese with BMI greater than 50 kg/m^2 can lose more weight and maintain weight loss better than the other bariatric procedures. It has also been shown that the biliopancreatic bypass with duodenal switch has a better effect on diabetes and reduction of hyperlipidemia than the other procedures. [43] The caveat is that this procedure requires an adequate follow-up program because there is an increased risk of nutritional deficiencies compared with other bariatric procedures.
Document 11 (Title: Surgical Options in the Treatment of Severe Obesity -- Other Issues -- Primarily Revisional Procedures): Band revisions are utilized in patients who fail the band or have health complications requiring removal. Options for a failed band procedure can include conversion to a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy, or biliopancreatic diversion with a duodenal switch. The band can also be replaced. Revisional timing is important due to inflammation or fibrosis of gastric tissue due to the band's presence. A staged approach can be utilized with the band removed, and then, after an 8-to-12-week period, the band can be converted to another bariatric procedure. [13]
Document 12 (Title: Duodenal switch: a new form of pancreaticobiliary diversion.): The duodenal switch operation is a new form of pancreaticobiliary diversion with superior physiologic consequences compared with the Roux-en-Y procedure. The new technique has been extensively tested in the laboratory and found to be nonulcerogenic and to be less disruptive of foregut physiology than the Roux-en-Y procedure. The duodenal switch has been used in more than 40 patients with confirmed duodenogastric reflux and has proved to be well tolerated and successful in long-term follow-up.
Document 13 (Title: Bariatric surgery): Bariatric surgery (or weight loss surgery) includes a variety of procedures performed on people who are obese. Long term weight loss through the standard of care procedures (Roux en-Y bypass, sleeve gastrectomy, and biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch) is largely achieved by altering gut hormone levels responsible for hunger and satiety, leading to a new hormonal weight set point. Bariatric surgery is a hormonal surgery in these procedures, for which the alteration in gut hormones develops as a result of the procedure's restriction and malabsorption.
Document 14 (Title: Biliopancreatic Diversion With Duodenal Switch -- Indications): The indications for biliopancreatic diversion are mainly for bariatric procedures, with a few exceptions. The classic criteria for bariatric surgery are: Body mass index (BMI) greater than or equal to 40 and BMI greater than or equal to 35 with at least one obesity-related comorbidity (such as diabetes mellitus, obstructive sleep apnea, hypertension, severely limiting musculoskeletal issues) Unsuccessful nonoperative weight loss treatments Mental health clearance No medical contraindications to surgery Super obese patients with BMI >50 should be considered for biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch [22] For patients who fail operative treatment with Roux en-Y bypass and gastric sleeve, biliopancreatic diversion with a duodenal switch should be considered [22] [23]
Document 15 (Title: Anesthetic Considerations In Bariatric Surgery -- Issues of Concern -- Types of Bariatric Surgery): The Roux-en-Y gastric bypass creates a small gastric pouch and anastomosis to a Roux limb of the jejunum that bypasses 75 to 150 cm of the small bowel, thereby restricting food volume at any given time and limiting absorption. Alternatively, a biliopancreatic diversion with a duodenal switch is associated with a more malabsorptive technique. The duodenal switch carries a greater risk for surgical complications but may be recommended for patients with severe obesity and diabetes. The duodenal switch reduces the size of the stomach by approximately 60% to 70% (versus 70% to 80% with a Roux-en-Y.) [16]
