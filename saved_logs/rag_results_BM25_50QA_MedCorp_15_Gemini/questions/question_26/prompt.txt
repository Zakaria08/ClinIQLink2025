Document 1 (Title: Biochemistry_Lippinco): Prognosis: The prognosis for recovery is excellent. Case-Related Questions: Choose the ONE best answer. Q1. Which of the following statements about vitamin C is correct? Vitamin C is: A. a competitor of iron absorption in the intestine. B. a fat-soluble vitamin with a 3-month supply typically stored in adipose tissue. C. a coenzyme in several enzymic reactions such as the hydroxylation of proline. D. required for the cross-linking of collagen. Q2. In contrast to the microcytic anemia characteristic of iron deficiency (common in older adults), a macrocytic anemia is seen with deficiencies of vitamin B12 and/or folic acid. These vitamin deficiencies are also common in older adults. Which of the following statements concerning these vitamins is correct? A. An inability to absorb B12 results in pernicious anemia. B. Both vitamins cause changes in gene expression. C. Folic acid plays a key role in energy metabolism in most cells.
Document 2 (Title: Nutrition: Micronutrient Intake, Imbalances, and Interventions -- Definition/Introduction -- Water-Soluble Vitamins): Vitamin B12 (cobalamin): Vitamin B12 is a water-soluble vitamin that is a cofactor in synthesizing DNA, fatty acids, and myelin, as well as erythropoiesis and the development of the nervous system. [7] [29] Bacteria synthesize cobalamin in the gastrointestinal tract of animals, and the host later absorbs it. Because vitamin B12 is concentrated in animal tissues, it is virtually found only in animal products such as meat, dairy, and eggs. [29] [30] The RDA of vitamin B12 for adults is 2.4 mcg/d. [31]
Document 3 (Title: Biochemistry_Lippinco): A. Folic acid B. Folic acid and vitamin B12 C. Iron D. Vitamin C Correct answer = A. Macrocytic anemia is seen with deficiencies of folic acid, vitamin B12, or both. Vitamin B12 is utilized in only two reactions in the body: the remethylation of homocysteine (Hcy) to methionine, which also requires folic acid (as tetrahydrofolate [THF]), and the isomerization of methylmalonyl coenzyme A to succinyl coenzyme A, which does not require THF. The elevated Hcy and normal methylmalonic acid levels in the patient’s blood reflect a deficiency of folic acid as the cause of the macrocytic anemia. Iron deficiency causes microcytic anemia, as can vitamin C deficiency.
Document 4 (Title: Vitamin D Toxicity -- Epidemiology): According to the latest report from America's Poison Centers (APC), there were 11,718 cases of vitamin D exposure recorded in the National Poison Data System. More than half of these cases were in children younger than 5 years. The vast majority of cases were from unintentional exposures. The total number of vitamin D toxicity cases was greater than the total number of vitamin (vitamins B, A, C, and E) toxicity cases combined. This illustrates the widespread use of vitamin D supplements. [13]
Document 5 (Title: Vitamin D -- Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes): Very few foods are a natural source of vitamin D. These include oily fish such as salmon, mackerel, and sardines. Foods fortified with vitamin D are milk and orange juice, and some bread and cereals. An important source of oral vitamin D is vitamin D supplements, which are available both over the counter and through prescription. These are available in strengths of 1000 IU, 2000 IU, 5000 IU, and 50,000 IU, which are available only through prescription. [12] [13] By engaging in interprofessional collaboration, the healthcare team can ensure patients are adequately supplied with this vital nutrient and drive their patients to better health. [Level 5]

Document 8 (Title: Biochemistry, Nutrients -- Introduction): Nutrients are chemical substances required by the body to sustain basic functions and are optimally obtained by eating a balanced diet. There are six major classes of nutrients essential for human health: carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, vitamins, minerals, and water. Carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins are considered macronutrients and serve as a source of energy. Water is required in large amounts but does not yield energy. Vitamins and minerals are considered micronutrients and play essential roles in metabolism. Vitamins are organic micronutrients classified as either water-soluble or fat-soluble. The essential water-soluble vitamins include vitamins B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, B7, B9, B12, and C. The essential fat-soluble vitamins include vitamins A, E, D, and K. Minerals are inorganic micronutrients. Minerals can classify as macrominerals or microminerals. Macrominerals are required in amounts greater than 100 mg per day and include calcium, phosphorous, magnesium, sodium, potassium, and chloride. Sodium, potassium, and chloride are also electrolytes. Microminerals are those nutrients required in amounts less than 100 mg per day and include iron, copper, zinc, selenium, and iodine. This article will review the following biochemical aspects of the essential nutrients: fundamentals, cellular, molecular, function, testing, and clinical significance. [1] [2]
Document 9 (Title: Lifestyle Prevention Measures for the Clinic Visit -- Other Issues): The human body needs vitamins and minerals for optimum cell growth and development, maintaining metabolic integrity and water regulation. Vitamins can be grouped into two categories; fat-soluble (A, D, E, and K) and water-soluble (B-complex and C). Deficiencies result from insufficient vitamin consumption, as the vitamins required cannot be found in one food source. Because of this, various diets are necessary to satisfy the body's vitamin needs. Asides from inadequate dietary vitamin consumption, other factors such as hereditary conditions, diseases of the intestinal tract, adverse effects of medication, and chronic alcohol use also result in vitamin deficiency. [24]
Document 10 (Title: Infant Nutrition Requirements and Options -- Function -- Vitamins:): Preterm infants are prone to vitamin deficiencies due to lower stores, increase requirements, and immature metabolic processes. The opposite is also true that these preterm infants are at higher risk for toxicity due to immature and compromised renal function. Fat-soluble vitamins include vitamins A, D, E, and K. Vitamin A (Retinol) is known to play an essential role in the growth and development of skin, eyes, bones, and pulmonary epithelium. It is thus implicated in chronic lung disease, photophobia, abnormal epiphyseal bone growth, and FTT. Vitamin E (tocopherol) has an antioxidant role in iron-induced hemolysis. Vitamin K plays a vital role in coagulation through carboxylation of prothrombin into its active form, thus essential in preventing hemorrhagic disease of the newborn. Vitamin D plays a crucial role in calcium and phosphorus metabolism in conjunction with parathyroid hormone. Vitamin D deficiency is associated with rickets, osteopenia of prematurity, and failure to thrive. Water-soluble vitamins B and C, on the other hand, require daily intake to meet their requirements.
Document 11 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): skin, a photochemical cleavage results in the formation of vitamin D from 7-dehydrocholesterol. Cutaneous production of vitamin D is decreased by melanin and high solar protection factor sunblocks, which effectively impair skin penetration by ultraviolet light. The increased use of sunblocks in North America and Western Europe and a reduction in the magnitude of solar exposure of the general population over the last several decades has led to an increased reliance on dietary sources of vitamin D. In the United States and Canada, these sources largely consist of fortified cereals and dairy products, in addition to fish oils and egg yolks. Vitamin D from plant sources is in the form of vitamin D2, whereas that from animal sources is vitamin D3. These two forms have equivalent biologic activity and are activated equally well by the vitamin D hydroxylases in humans. Vitamin D enters the circulation, whether absorbed from the intestine or synthesized cutaneously, bound to vitamin D–binding
Document 12 (Title: Vitamin C Deficiency -- Treatment / Management): Treating scurvy involves consuming sufficient fruits and vegetables to prevent recurrences and addressing the underlying causes of malnutrition that lead to vitamin C deficiency. The recommended daily vitamin C intake varies based on age, sex, pregnancy, and lactation. The amount of vitamin C required for children is 15 to 75 mg, men 90 mg, women 75 mg, pregnant women 85 mg, and lactating women 120 mg. Smoking leads to a depletion of vitamin C levels, requiring smokers to consume an additional vitamin C of 35 mg/d. Vitamin C is found in a wide range of foods. According to the United States National Institutes of Health, Office of Dietary Supplements, vitamin C can be easily obtained from the following sources: 1/2 cup red pepper: 95 mg 1 medium orange: 70 mg 1/2 cup strawberries: 49 mg 1/2 cup Brussels sprouts: 48 mg 1 baked potato: 17 mg

Document 14 (Title: Pediatrics_Nelson): In contrast to other water-soluble vitamins, absorption of vitamin B12 is complex, involving cleavage of the vitamin from dietary protein and binding to a glycoprotein called intrinsic factor, which is secreted by the gastric mucosa (parietal cells). The cobalamin–intrinsic factor complex is efficiently absorbed from the distal ileum. As vitamin B12 is absorbed into the portal circulation, it is transported bound to a specific protein, transcobalamin II. Its large stores in the liver also are unusual for a water-soluble vitamin. Efficient enterohepatic circulation normally protects from deficiency for months to years. Dietary sources of the vitamin are animal products only. Strict vegetarians should take a vitamin B12 supplement.
Document 15 (Title: Vitamin C Deficiency -- Etiology): Vitamin C is water-soluble and gets absorbed in the distal ileum. The absorption of the vitamin is efficient at dosages up to 100 mg/d. However, when intake exceeds 1500 mg/d, the absorption of the vitamin decreases to 50% or less. [8] A small amount of vitamin C is found in leukocytes, adrenal glands, and the pituitary gland. Nevertheless, the vitamin C stores in the human body are limited due to its water-soluble nature, and any excess amount is typically excreted from the body. The human body has around 1500 mg of vitamin C in total, and clinical signs of deficiency are exhibited when the level drops below 350 mg. Symptoms of scurvy appear within 4 to 12 weeks of insufficient vitamin C intake. Plasma concentrations primarily indicate recent or current consumption rather than stores and may lack clinical utility. [10] [11] [12] [13]
