Document 1 (Title: Chromatography -- Introduction -- High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC)): This is a highly sensitive and efficient technique among different chromatography techniques, also known as high-pressure liquid chromatography. [1] Here, the solvent mixture can pass through columns containing stationary phases under high atmospheric pressure of 10 Pa to 400 Pa. This high pressure creates a high flow rate in a sample of 0.1 cm/sec to 5 cm/sec, allowing separation in a few minutes. High pressure ensures high resolution and better separation of closely related compounds; it also enables using MS as detectors, which require high flow rates. [4] The eluents are detected using UV absorption and fluorescence. The basic instrumentation setup is given in image 3.
Document 2 (Title: Biochemistry_Lippinco): the chromatography column by eluting with solutions of increasing ionic strength and pH (Fig. 2.3). The separated amino acids contained in the eluate from the column are quantitated by heating them with ninhydrin (a reagent that forms a purple compound with most amino acids, ammonia, and amines). The amount of each amino acid is determined spectrophotometrically by measuring the amount of light absorbed by the ninhydrin derivative. The analysis described above is performed using an amino acid analyzer, an automated machine whose components are depicted in Figure 2.3.
Document 3 (Title: Beta2 Receptor Agonists and Antagonists -- Monitoring): The plasma concentration of B2 agonists correlates with the severity of the toxicity. Direct monitoring of B2 agonists is not a regular procedure in clinical practice, as their efficacy and toxicity can be measured clinically or by using indirect tests. Nevertheless, there are some recognized tests for measuring drug concentration in the bloodstream, such as gas chromatography or liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry, high-performance liquid chromatography, fluorimetric detectors, and electrochemical detectors. Monitoring techniques are primarily used before athletic competitions to check for their use as anabolic agents. [5] Clinically, serum potassium and blood glucose require regular monitoring to manage any adverse effects early. The recurrence of asthma attacks is not an indicator of the efficacy of B2 agonists, as the main drug responsible for long-term effects is steroids.
Document 4 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Several systems use substrates for preformed bacterial enzymes for identification within 2–3 h. These systems do not rely on bacterial growth per se to determine whether a substrate has been used. They employ a heavy inoculum in which specific bacterial enzymes are present in amounts sufficient to convert substrate to product rapidly. In addition, some systems use fluorogenic substrate/endproduct detection methods to increase sensitivity through signal amplification. Gas-Liquid Chromatography Gas-liquid chromatography often is used to detect metabolic end products of bacterial fermentation. One common application is identification of short-chain fatty acids produced by obligate anaerobes during glucose fermentation. Because the types and relative concentrations of volatile acids differ among the various genera and species that make up this group of organisms, such information serves as a metabolic fingerprint for a particular isolate.
Document 5 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): is a common comorbid condition. On the other hand, if the continu-ous monitoring capacity afforded by these monitors can provide usable trend data, that may still provide clinical utility despite less accuracy at low hemoglobin levels. To date, there have been relatively few studies validating the trending capacity of noninvasive Hgb monitoring compared to serial blood draws, with limited agreement due to differences in analysis and study design.65 Further studies are required to evaluate the clinical utility of this potentially useful technology.CapnometryCapnometry is the measurement of carbon dioxide in the airway throughout the respiratory cycle. Capnometry is most commonly measured by infrared light absorption. CO2 absorbs infrared light at a peak wavelength of approximately 4.27 µm. Capnom-etry works by passing infrared light through a sample chamber to a detector on the opposite side. More infrared light passing through the sample chamber (i.e., less CO2) causes a larger
Document 6 (Title: Chromatography -- Testing Procedures): 5 . Detection and interpretation: In column chromatography, as the solute migrates through the entire system and emerges from the column, the detectors continuously monitor the emerging mobile phase called the eluate and transmit signals in the form of voltage recorded on the chromatograph. Some of the detectors used in chromatography are mass spectrometry, refractive index, electrochemical, ultraviolet, flame ionization, electron capture, and fluorescence detectors. [25] Among these, ultraviolet detectors are the most commonly used in clinical laboratories.
Document 7 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): µm. Capnom-etry works by passing infrared light through a sample chamber to a detector on the opposite side. More infrared light passing through the sample chamber (i.e., less CO2) causes a larger sig-nal in the detector relative to the infrared light passing through a reference cell. Capnometric determination of the partial pressure of CO2 in end-tidal exhaled gas (Petco2) is used as a surrogate for the partial pressure of CO2 in arterial blood (Paco2) during mechanical ventilation. In healthy subjects, Petco2 is about 1 to 5 mmHg less than Paco2.66 Thus, Petco2 can be used to estimate Paco2 without the need for blood gas determination. However, changes in Petco2 may not correlate with changes in Paco2 dur-ing a number of pathologic conditions.Capnography allows the confirmation of endotracheal intubation and continuous assessment of ventilation, integrity of the airway, operation of the ventilator, and cardiopulmonary function. Capnometers are configured with either an inline
Document 8 (Title: Chromatography -- Diagnostic Tests): M. Tswett was the first to perform chromatography on plant pigments in 1906 using calcium carbonate as a stationary phase. Over time, thin-layer chromatography, gas chromatography, and HPLC were applied. Now, ultra HPLC, two-dimensional GC with full automation, and an advanced detector system are in use. [4] Since then, chromatography has evolved and found its application in many fields, such as analytical chemistry, clinical diagnostics, forensics, food science, pharmacology, and molecular biology.
Document 9 (Title: Histology_Ross): The method is useful in detecting nucleic acids, specifically the purine and pyrimidine bases of the nucleotides. It is also useful for detecting proteins that contain certain amino acids. Using specific illuminating wavelengths, UV spectrophotometric measurements are commonly made through the UV microscope to determine quantitatively the amount of DNA and RNA in individual cells. As described in the Folder 1.2 on page 7, Feulgen microspectrophoto metry is used clinically to evaluate the degree of ploidy (multiples of normal DNA quantity) in sections of tumors. The polarizing microscope uses the fact that highly ordered molecules or arrays of molecules can rotate the angle of the plane of polarized light. The polarizing microscope is a simple modification of the light microscope in which a polarizing filter (the polarizer) is located between the light source and the specimen, and a second polarizer (the analyzer) is located between the objective lens and the viewer.
Document 10 (Title: Oxygen Saturation -- Equipment): The pulse oximeter consists of a probe containing LEDs and a photodetector. The LEDs emit light at fixed, selected wavelengths. The photodetector measures the quantity of light transmitted through a selected vascular bed, such as a fingertip or earlobe. Pulse oximetry uses the Beer-Lambert law of light absorption. This law describes how light is absorbed when it passes through a clear solvent, such as plasma, that contains a solute that absorbs light at a specific wavelength, such as hemoglobin. [4] The absorption spectra of oxygenated and reduced hemoglobin differ. For this reason, arterial blood appears red, while venous blood appears blue. However, because living tissue absorbs light, it is difficult to determine the ratio of saturation of hemoglobin in the body. The oximeter probe overcomes this difficulty by emitting light pulses, 1 red and 1 infrared. A detector is placed opposite the lights on the other side of the tissue. The diodes switch on and off in rapid sequence, and the detector measures the differences. The measurements feed into an algorithm in a microprocessor where the oxyhemoglobin saturation is calculated and eventually displayed to the user (see Image. Monitor Shows Mixed Venous Oxygen Saturation Value). [3]
Document 11 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): the development of the PAC, determining cardiac output (QT) at the bedside required careful measurements of oxygen consumption (Fick method) or spectrophotometric determina-tion of indocyanine green dye dilution curves. Measurements of QT using the thermodilution technique are simple and reason-ably accurate. The measurements can be performed repetitively, and the principle is straightforward. If a bolus of an indicator is rapidly and thoroughly mixed with a moving fluid upstream from a detector, then the concentration of the indicator at the detector will increase sharply and then exponentially diminish back to zero. The area under the resulting time-concentration curve is a function of the volume of indicator injected and the flow rate of the moving stream of fluid. Larger volumes of indi-cator result in greater areas under the curve, and faster flow rates of the mixing fluid result in smaller areas under the curve. When QT is measured by thermodilution, the indicator is heat and
Document 12 (Title: Chromatography -- Introduction -- Gas Chromatography): In liquid chromatography (LC), the mobile phase is a liquid in which the sample with ions and molecules is dissolved. The 2 most common forms of LC used for analysis are liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Liquid chromatography (LC), when combined with MS, is highly efficient with low detection limits. [14] MS further sorts and identifies the compounds eluted from LC in the electric and magnetic fields according to the charge mass ratio.
Document 13 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Toxicologic analysis of urine and blood (and occasionally of gastric contents and chemical samples) can sometimes confirm or rule out suspected poisoning. Interpretation of laboratory data requires knowledge of the qualitative and quantitative tests used for screening and confirmation (enzyme-multiplied, fluorescence polarization, and radio-immunoassays; colorimetric and fluorometric assays; thin-layer, gas-liquid, or high-performance liquid chromatography; gas chromatography; mass spectrometry), their sensitivity (limit of detection) and specificity, the preferred biologic specimen for analysis, and the 473e-4 optimal time of specimen sampling. Personal communication with the hospital laboratory is essential to an understanding of institutional testing capabilities and limitations. Rapid qualitative hospital-based urine tests for drugs of abuse are only screening tests that cannot confirm the exact identity of the detected substance and should not be considered diagnostic or used for
Document 14 (Title: Immunology_Janeway): Fig. A.4 Affinity chromatography uses antigen–antibody binding to purify antigens or antibodies. To purify a specific antigen from a complex mixture of molecules, a monoclonal antibody is attached to an insoluble matrix, such as chromatography beads, and the mixture of molecules is passed over the matrix. The specific antibody binds the antigen of interest; other molecules are washed away. Specific antigen is then eluted by altering the pH, which can usually disrupt antibody– antigen bonds. Antibodies can be purified in the same way on beads coupled to antigen (not shown). Add anti-A antibody covalently linked to enzyme Wash away unbound antibody sample 1 (antigen A) sample 2 (antigen B) Enzyme makes colored product from added colorless substrate Measure absorbance of light by colored product Fig. A.5 The principle of the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
Document 15 (Title: Chromatography -- Introduction -- Gas Chromatography): Here, inert gasses like nitrogen, helium, or argon or a low-mass gas such as hydrogen are used in the mobile phase to separate volatile compounds or substances that can become volatile after derivatization. The separation occurs based on the differences in vapor pressure after converting them into volatile compounds. [12] Gas chromatography (GC) estimates lipids, drugs, and vitamins. [13] There are several ways of classifying GC methods based on the type of stationary phase present. These categories include gas-solid chromatography (GSC), gas-liquid chromatography (GLC), and bonded phase gas chromatography. [1] Liquid C hromatography
