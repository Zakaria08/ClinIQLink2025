Document 1 (Title: Urticaria Pigmentosa  -- Treatment / Management): The management of cutaneous mastocytosis begins with practical measures, such as the use of lukewarm water for bathing, air conditioning during hot weather, and avoidance of triggers for mast cell degranulation. Treatment is symptomatic for patients with cutaneous mastocytosis.
Document 2 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): vascular collapse; it is distinguished from cholinergic urticaria by presenting with wheals of conventional size and by not occurring with fever or a hot bath. Cold urticaria is local at body areas exposed to low ambient temperature or cold objects but can progress to vascular collapse with immersion in cold water (swimming). Solar urticaria is subdivided into six groups by the response to specific portions of the light spectrum. Vibratory angioedema may occur after years of occupational exposure or can be idiopathic; it may be accompanied by cholinergic urticaria. Other rare formsofphysicalallergy,alwaysdefinedbystimulus-specificelicitation, include local heat urticaria, aquagenic urticaria fromcontactwithwater of anytemperature (sometimesassociatedwithpolycythemiavera),and contact urticaria from direct interaction with some chemical substance.
Document 3 (Title: Pediatrics_Nelson): The most common physical urticaria is dermatographism, affecting 2% to 5% of persons. Dermatographism means “writing on the skin” and is easily diagnosed by firmly scratching the skin with a blunt point, such as the wooden tip of a cotton swab or tongue depressor. It is characterized by an urticarial reaction localized to the site of skin trauma. It has been suggested that trauma induces an IgE-mediated reaction causing histamine to be released from the mast cells. Cholinergic urticaria, characterized by the appearance of 1to 3-mm wheals surrounded by large erythematous flares after an increase in core body temperature, occurs commonly in young adults. Lesions may develop during strenuous exercise, after a hot bath, or emotional stress. The lack of airway symptoms differentiates it from exercise-induced anaphylaxis.
Document 4 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): The common physical urticarias include dermatographism, solar urticaria, cold urticaria, and cholinergic urticaria. Patients with dermatographism exhibit linear wheals following minor pressure or scratching of the skin. It is a common disorder, affecting ~5% of the population. Solar urticaria characteristically occurs within minutes of sun exposure and is a skin sign of one systemic disease—erythropoietic protoporphyria. In addition to the urticaria, these patients have subtle pitted scarring of the nose and hands. Cold urticaria is precipitated by exposure to the cold, and therefore exposed areas are usually affected. In occasional patients, the disease is associated with abnormal circulating proteins—more commonly cryoglobulins and less commonly cryofibrinogens. Additional systemic symptoms include wheezing and syncope, thus explaining the need for these patients to avoid swimming in cold water. Autosomal dominantly inherited cold urticaria is associated with dysfunction of
Document 5 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Perhaps the best-studied example of IgE-and mast cell–mediated urticaria and angioedema is cold urticaria. Cryoglobulins or cold agglutinins are present in up to 5% of these patients. Immersion of an extremity in an ice bath precipitates angioedema of the distal portion with urticaria at the air interface within minutes of the challenge. Histologic studies reveal marked mast cell degranulation with associatededema of the dermis and subcutaneous tissues. Thehistamine level in the plasma of venous effluent of the cold-challenged and angioedematous extremity is markedly increased, but no such increase appears in the plasma of effluent of the contralateral normal extremity. Elevated levels of histamine have been found in the plasma of venous effluent and in the fluid of suction blisters at experimentally induced lesional sites in patients with dermographism, pressure urticaria, vibratory angioedema, light urticaria, and heat urticaria. By ultrastructural analysis, the pattern of mast cell
Document 6 (Title: Neonatal Jaundice -- Treatment / Management -- Phototherapy): Bilirubin optimally absorbs light in the blue-green range (ie, 460-490 nm). The underlying mechanism of PT involves inducing photoisomerization and converting bilirubin into lumirubin, which is readily excreted into bile and urine. [96] During phototherapy, the neonate's maximum body surface area should be exposed to the light source while keeping the eyes covered to avoid retinal injury, and interruptions should be minimized. The maintenance of hydration is necessary to ensure adequate urine output, as most bilirubin is excreted in the urine as lumirubin, a structural isomer of bilirubin formed during phototherapy. Therefore, breastfeeding support should be offered to all nursing mothers as early initiation of breastfeeding and frequent, on-demand feeding decreases the likelihood of dehydration. Although supplemental oral water and dextrose water are not recommended, supplemental pumped breastmilk or infant formula can be considered for feeding issues, including infants with ineffective sucking or latching or inadequate maternal milk production. [34]
Document 7 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): symptoms include wheezing and syncope, thus explaining the need for these patients to avoid swimming in cold water. Autosomal dominantly inherited cold urticaria is associated with dysfunction of cryopyrin. Cholinergic urticaria is precipitated by heat, exercise, or emotion and is characterized by small wheals with relatively large flares. It is occasionally associated with wheezing.
Document 8 (Title: Wheat Allergy -- History and Physical): Patients with wheat dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis (WDEIA) usually have symptoms that include pruritus, urticaria, angioedema, flushing, shortness of breath, dysphagia, chest tightness, profuse sweating, syncope, headache, diarrhea, nausea, throat closing, abdominal pain, and hoarseness that occurs during intense physical exercise following wheat intake in the prior four hours before symptom onset.

Document 9 (Title: Pediatrics_Nelson): American Academy of Pediatrics: Prevention of rickets and vitamin D defi ciency: new guidelines for vitamin D intake, Pediatrics 122:1142–1152, 2008 Larry A. Greenbaum and Raed Bou-Matar 7 Water is the most plentiful constituent of the human body. Total body water (TBW) as a percentage of body weight varies with age. The fetus has a high TBW, which gradually decreases to about 75% of birth weight for a term infant. Premature infants have a higher TBW content than term infants. During the first year of life, TBW decreases to about 60% of body weight and basically remains at this level until puberty. At puberty, the fat content of females increases more than that of males, who acquire more muscle mass than females. Because fat has low water content, and muscle has high water content, by the end of puberty TBW in males remains at 60%, but it decreases to 50% of body weight in females. During dehydration, TBW decreases and is a smaller percentage of body weight.
Document 10 (Title: Assisting Patients With Personal Hygiene -- Nursing, Allied Health, and Interprofessional Team Interventions -- Bathing): Bathing in a bed can be done either with a washbasin filled with water or with prepackaged cloths that do not require water. The wipes that do not require water are known as bag baths. If using a wash bin and cloths, ensure they are single-use items to prevent the spread of bacteria. In 2017, a systematic review found that patients preferred a standard water and soap bath, but the bag bath was a useful alternative. [6] When bathing, gloves are not required, but patients may prefer the helper to use gloves. [8] When bathing elderly patients, moisturizing soaps or water and oil soaked with lotion are used to prevent dryness. [9] Bathing toiletries should be either assigned to a specific patient or single-use items to prevent the spread of infection between patients.

Exercise-induced anaphylaxis can be precipitated by exertion alone or can be dependent on prior food ingestion. There is an association with the presence of IgE specific for α-5 gliadin, a component of wheat. The clinical presentation can be limited to flushing, erythema, and pruritic urticaria but may progress to angioedema of the face, oropharynx, larynx, or intestine or to vascular collapse; it is distinguished from cholinergic urticaria by presenting with wheals of conventional size and by not occurring with fever or a hot bath. Cold urticaria is local at body areas
Document 12 (Title: Fexofenadine -- Indications -- FDA-Approved Indications): Chronic idiopathic urticaria: Chronic idiopathic urticaria is caused by spontaneous mast cell degranulation. [2] Symptomatic triggers include water, sweat, sun, cold, or pressure, including dermatographism and urticarial rash. In addition, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may induce chronic urticaria. [5] Fexofenadine is also effective in treating cholinergic urticaria. [6] According to AAAAI and the American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (ACAAI), second-generation antihistamines, such as fexofenadine, are considered safe and effective for managing cholinergic urticaria. [7]
Document 13 (Title: Fludrocortisone -- Administration -- Specific Patient Populations): Pregnancy considerations: Fludrocortisone is a category C pregnancy drug. Fludrocortisone acetate should only be given to a pregnant woman if absolutely necessary. Additionally, infants born to mothers who received substantial doses of fludrocortisone acetate during pregnancy should be carefully observed for signs of hypoadrenalism. According to the Heart Rhythm Society (HRS) guidelines 2023, syncope is common in pregnancy due to altered venous return and cardiac output; vasovagal syncope is most commonly encountered. Conservative measures, such as increasing salt and water intake and avoiding triggers, are first-line therapies. Increased salt intake and fludrocortisone may be helpful in refractory cases after the first trimester. [14]
Document 14 (Title: Pediatrics_Nelson): Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is initially difficult to diagnose. Infants, but not older children, frequently present withsigns of heart failure. Sudden death may be the initial presentation in older children. Dyspnea, fatigue, chest pain,syncope or near-syncope, and palpitations may be present.A murmur is heard in more than 50% of children referred after identification of an affected family member. Restrictive cardiomyopathies are relatively rare in pediatrics. Presentingsymptoms usually include dyspnea exacerbated by a respiratory illness, syncope, hepatomegaly, and an S4 heart sound on examination.
Document 15 (Title: Dermatopathology Histology Artifacts -- Tissue Preparation): The dehydration step takes the tissue through increasing concentrations of alcohol, commonly ethanol or isopropanol, to remove water from the specimen through osmosis. Following dehydration, tissue is often bathed in xylene to remove the dehydrating agents, as they are not miscible with paraffin and will dissolve lipids. The tissue specimen will then undergo infiltration as it is placed in a supportive medium to preserve the tissue's form during microtomy. The most commonly used medium for infiltration is paraffin. [7]
