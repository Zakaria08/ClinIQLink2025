Document 1 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): Since bone and kidney play central roles in bone mineral homeostasis, conditions that alter bone mineral homeostasis usually affect one or both of these tissues secondarily. Effects on bone can result in osteoporosis (abnormal loss of bone; remaining bone histologically normal), osteomalacia (abnormal bone formation due to inadequate mineralization), or osteitis fibrosa (excessive bone resorption with fibrotic replacement of resorption cavities and marrow). Biochemical markers of skeletal involvement include changes in serum levels of the skeletal isoenzyme of alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, and Nand C-terminal propeptides of type I collagen (reflecting osteoblastic activity), and serum and urine levels of tartrateresistant acid phosphatase and collagen breakdown products (reflecting osteoclastic activity). The kidney becomes involved when the calcium × phosphate product in serum rises above the point at which ectopic calcification occurs (nephrocalcinosis) or when the calcium ×
Document 2 (Title: Acid Phosphatase -- Clinical Significance -- Acid Phosphatase as a Marker): Bone tissue is a dynamic structure that is continuously formed and resorbed in a balanced process. Osteoclasts, the cells responsible for bone resorption, express another acid phosphatase isoform. Indeed, several studies have shown that acid phosphatase is directly involved in bone resorption. Bone acid phosphatase differs from prostatic acid phosphatase in being a tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase. In osteoporosis, the most common bone disease in humans, the resorption/formation balance becomes disrupted in favor of resorption. Several serum markers for bone resorption have been proposed, such as urinary hydroxyproline, total urinary pyridinoline, and bone sialoprotein. Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase is precise, resistant to hemolysis, and shows minimal day-to-day variability, making it a potential marker for monitoring therapy response, though it is still under development. In addition, agents that inhibit tartrate-resistant acid phosphatases, such as fluoride, have been shown to improve and even reverse osteoporosis cases. [4] [5]
Document 3 (Title: Biochemical Markers of Osteoporosis -- Introduction -- Bone Turnover Biomarkers): Bone turnover markers (BTMs) are byproducts of the bone remodeling process and can be measured in urine or serum. BTMs are categorized as markers of bone formation or bone resorption. Markers of bone formation include total and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (ALP), procollagen type 1 N-propeptide (P1NP), osteocalcin, and procollagen type 1 C-propeptide (P1CP). Markers of bone resorption include hydroxyproline, pyridinoline, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b, deoxypyridinoline, the carboxy-terminal cross-linked telopeptide of type 1 collagen (CTX-1), and the amino-terminal cross-linked telopeptide of type 1 collagen (NTX-1). [11] [12]
Document 4 (Title: Osteoporosis in Females -- Evaluation -- Imaging): Besides the DEXA scan, other radiological tests could be used to support and differentiate the cause of fracture, including pathological and secondary fractures from malignancies. These include conventional radiography, CT (computed tomography (CT) scans, MRI, and bone scan (scintigraphy). Recently, the use of bone turnover markers was introduced as part of monitoring treatment failures or responses. They are not used in isolation as some results are nonspecific, but they could be helpful in complex patient assessments where DEXA scans alone might not be sufficient for decision making. These include serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and bone-specific ALP. Serum osteocalcin (a specific marker for osteoblastic function), serum type 1 procollagen, or serum carboxy-terminal collagen crosslinks (CTX) (a marker for bone resorption) are used as treatment response markers. [16] Besides these, there are other bone resorption markers like urinary hydroxyproline, urinary pyridinoline, bone sialoprotein, and few others.
Document 5 (Title: Gynecology_Novak): mg medroxyprogesterone acetate, 0.625 mg of conjugated estrogen plus 2.5 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate, 1 μg of 1-alpha hydroxy vitamin D3, and 1.8 g calcium lactate containing 250 mg of elemental calcium. Outcome measures were taken at baseline, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months, and included the following assessments: bone mineral density at third lumbar vertebrae, serum levels of osteocalcin, total alkaline phosphatase, and urinary ratios of calcium/creatinine and hydroxyproline/creatinine. The findings revealed decreased bone mineral density in the vitamin D and calcium groups and no decrease in the conjugated estrogen and E3 groups. Osteocalcin and alkaline phosphate was decreased or without change in the conjugated estrogen and E3 groups, and was increased in the vitamin D3 and calcium groups. Urinary calcium/creatinine ratios were decreased with E3 and conjugated estrogen, and there was no decrease with the use of vitamin D3 and calcium. Urinary hydroxyproline/creatinine ratios were
Document 6 (Title: Histology, Osteoblasts -- Clinical Significance -- Osteoblast Markers): Many serum biomarkers of osteoblast function exist. These include osteoprotegerin (OPG), receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), bone alkaline phosphatase (B-ALP), osteocalcin, procollagen type 1 carboxy-terminal propeptide (P1CP) and procollagen type 1 amino-terminal propeptide (P1NP). [21] [52] Seldomly are the majority of these markers utilized clinically to measure osteoblast function due to cost, analytical inconsistencies, and undetermined clinical significance. [53] [54] [55] Osteocalcin is the most specific marker for osteoblastic activity. [38]

(Reproduced, with permission, from Kasper DL et al. Harrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine, 16th ed. New York: McGraw-Hill, 2005: 2280.) Imaging: Radionuclide bone scan is the most sensitive test. Labs: Abnormalities include ↑ serum alkaline phosphatase with normal calcium and phosphate levels; urinary pyridinolines may be helpful. Must be differentiated from metastatic bone disease. The majority of patients are asymptomatic and require no treatment. There is no cure for Paget’s disease. Bisphosphonates and calcitonin are used to slow osteoclastic bone resorption; NSAIDs and acetaminophen can be given for arthritis pain. Pathologic fractures, cardiac complications, osteosarcoma (up to 1%).
Document 8 (Title: Physiology, Bone Remodeling -- Related Testing -- Serum Markers of Bone Formation): Evidence of bone formation is indicated by the presence of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), bone alkaline phosphatase (B-ALP), osteocalcin (OC), and C- and N-terminal propeptide of type 1 procollagen (PICP and PINP). ALP is specific for bone formation, but only if the patient has no bile duct or liver disease. B-ALP is a specific product from osteoblast cells. OC is another specific osteoblast product, and there can be several active types. PICP and PINP are products of proliferating fibroblasts and osteoblasts.
Document 9 (Title: Physiology, Bone Remodeling -- Related Testing -- Serum Markers of Bone Resorption): Bone resorption markers include, but are not limited to, hydroxyproline (OHP), pyridinoline (PYD), deoxypyridinoline (DPD), bone sialoprotein (BSP), and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TR-ACP). OHP is a significant part of protein collagen and plays a role in collagen stability. PYD has high concentrations of bone collagen and cartilage but is not present in the skin. Unlike PYD, DPD is highly concentrated in bone collagen but is absent in cartilage and skin. BSP is made by osteoblasts and is present in the extracellular bone matrix. Osteoclasts, thrombocytes, and erythrocytes make TR-ACP.

Osteoblast activity can be assessed by measuring serum bone-specific Growth in width and thickness is accomplished by formation of alkaline phosphatase. Similarly, osteocalcin, a protein secreted from bone at the periosteal surface and by resorption at the endosteal osteoblasts, is made virtually only by osteoblasts.

Document 12 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): Paget’s disease is a localized bone disorder characterized by uncontrolled osteoclastic bone resorption with secondary increases in poorly organized bone formation. The cause of Paget’s disease is obscure, although some studies suggest that a measles-related virus may be involved. The disease is fairly common, although symptomatic bone disease is less common. Recent studies indicate that this infection may produce a factor that increases the stimulation of bone resorption by 1,25(OH)2D. The biochemical parameters of elevated serum alkaline phosphatase and urinary hydroxyproline are useful for diagnosis. Along with the characteristic radiologic and bone scan findings, these biochemical determinations provide good markers by which to follow therapy.
Document 13 (Title: Histology_Ross): The osteoblast is the differentiated bone-forming cell that secretes bone matrix. Like its close relatives, the fibroblast and the chondroblast, the osteoblast is a versatile secretory cell that retains the ability to divide. It secretes both type I collagen (which constitutes 90% of the protein in bone) and bone matrix proteins (BMPs), which constitute the initial unmineralized bone, or osteoid. The bone matrix proteins produced by the osteoblast include calcium-binding proteins such as osteocalcin and osteonectin; multiadhesive glycoproteins such as bone sialoproteins I and II, osteopontin, and thrombospondin, various proteoglycans and their aggregates, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP). Circulating levels of ALP and osteocalcin are used clinically as markers of osteoblast activity.
Document 14 (Title: Bone Metastasis -- Evaluation -- Nuclear Medicine): Blood tests can aid in supporting the diagnosis of bone metastases. Complete blood count and a comprehensive metabolic panel should be obtained routinely. CBC may reveal anemia, thrombocytopenia, or pancytopenia in late stages. Serum calcium and alkaline phosphatase may be elevated due to ongoing osteolysis. Bone turnover markers are still being studied as indicators of bone resorption. Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase has been proven to elevated in patients with breast and prostate cancer with bone metastases.
Document 15 (Title: Acid Phosphatase -- Clinical Significance -- Acid Phosphatase as a Marker): Acid phosphatase has also undergone evaluation in malignancies. Hairy cell leukemia is a chronic lymphoproliferative disease in which neoplastic B cells infiltrate the bone marrow, spleen, and blood, leading to splenomegaly, anemia, and recurring infections. Leukemic cells in hairy cell leukemia have an intracytoplasmic tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase enzyme. In most patients, aspirates from blood or bone marrow are testable for the presence of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase, which is highly sensitive and specific to hairy cell leukemia, aiding in its detection and diagnosis. [6] Furthermore, when metastasizing to bones, several types of malignancies can induce bone resorption through several steps, including higher expression of acid phosphatase. In these cases, acid phosphatase serves as a serological and histological prognostic marker and a tool to monitor treatment response. [7] [8] Another clinical entity where acid phosphatase can be useful is Gaucher disease, the most common lysosomal storage disease observed worldwide. Gaucher disease commonly presents with unexplained hepatosplenomegaly and pancytopenia. The disease is treatable through enzyme replacement therapy with glucocerebrosidase. A serum maker known as chitotriosidase is typically used to monitor the disease burden and response to enzyme replacement. However, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatases may be used instead as a marker when it is normal.
