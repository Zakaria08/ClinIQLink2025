Document 1 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): These opioids differ mainly in their potency and biodisposition. Sufentanil is five to seven times more potent than fentanyl. Alfentanil is considerably less potent than fentanyl, but acts more rapidly and has a markedly shorter duration of action. Remifentanil is metabolized very rapidly by blood and nonspecific tissue esterases, making its pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic half-lives extremely short. Such properties are useful when these compounds are used in anesthesia practice. Although fentanyl is now the predominant analgesic in the phenylpiperidine class, meperidine continues to be used. This older opioid has significant antimuscarinic effects, which may be a contraindication if tachycardia would be a problem. Meperidine is also reported to have a negative inotropic action on the heart. In addition, it has the potential for producing seizures secondary to accumulation of its metabolite, normeperidine, in patients receiving high doses or with concurrent renal failure. Given
Document 2 (Title: Relative Risk -- Issues of Concern): The odds ratio compares the odds of some event in an exposed group versus the odds in a non-exposed group and is calculated as the number of events / the number of non-events. Stated another way, if the probability of an event is P, then the odds ratio would be P / (1 – P).  In a two-by-two table with cells a, b, c, and d then the odds ratio is odds of the event in the exposure group (a/b) divided by the odds of the event in the control or non-exposure group (c/d). Thus the odds ratio is (a/b) / (c/d) which simplifies to ad/bc. This is compared to the relative risk which is (a / (a+b)) / (c / (c+d)). If the disease condition (event) is rare, then the odds ratio and relative risk may be comparable, but the odds ratio will overestimate the risk if the disease is more common.  In such cases, the odds ratio should be avoided, and the relative risk will be a more accurate estimation of risk. See Table. Calculations of Relative Risk and Odds Ratio, 2 x 2 Table.
Document 3 (Title: Odds Ratio -- Issues of Concern): The odds ratio can be confused with relative risk.  As stated above, the odds ratio is a ratio of 2 odds. As odds of an event are always positive, the odds ratio is always positive and ranges from zero to very large. The relative risk is a ratio of probabilities of the event occurring in all exposed individuals versus the event occurring in all non-exposed individuals. In a 2-by-2 table with cells a, b, c, and d (see figure), the odds ratio is odds of the event in the exposure group (a/b) divided by the odds of the event in the control or non-exposure group (c/d). Thus the odds ratio is (a/b) / (c/d) which simplifies to ad/bc.  This is compared to the relative risk which is (a / (a+b)) / (c / (c+d)).  If the disease condition (event) is rare, then the odds ratio and relative risk may be comparable, but the odds ratio will overestimate the risk if the disease is more common.  In such cases, the odds ratio should be avoided, and the relative risk will be a more accurate estimation of risk. [3] Commonly, odds ratios will be reported in case-control studies, in which relative risks cannot be calculated.
Document 4 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): Acetohexamide is no longer available in the United States. Its half-life is only about 1 hour but its more active metabolite, hydroxyhexamide, has a half-life of 4–6 hours; thus the drug duration of action is 8–24 hours. Where available, its dosage is 0.25–1.5 g/d as single dose or in two divided doses. Chlorpropamide, tolazamide, and acetohexamide are now rarely used in clinical practice. Glyburide, glipizide, gliclazide, and glimepiride are 100–200 times more potent than tolbutamide. They should be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular disease or in elderly patients, in whom hypoglycemia would be especially dangerous.
Document 5 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): The kidney appears to play an important role in its metabolism and excretion. Somatostatin has limited therapeutic usefulness because of its short duration of action and multiple effects in many secretory systems. A series of longer-acting somatostatin analogs that retain biologic activity have been developed. Octreotide, the most widely used somatostatin analog (Figure 37–2), is 45 times more potent than somatostatin in inhibiting GH release but only twice as potent in reducing insulin secretion. Because of this relatively reduced effect on pancreatic beta cells, hyperglycemia rarely occurs during treatment. The plasma elimination half-life of octreotide is about 80 minutes, 30 times longer than that of somatostatin.
Document 6 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): 1. Potency—Drugs A and B are said to be more potent than drugs C and D because of the relative positions of their dose-response curves along the dose axis of Figure 2–15. Potency refers to the concentration (EC50) or dose (ED50) of a drug required to produce 50% of that drug’s maximal effect. Thus, the pharmacologic potency of drug A in Figure 2–15 is less than that of drug B, a partial agonist because the EC50 of A is greater than the EC50 of B. Potency of a drug depends in part on the affinity (Kd) of receptors for binding the drug and in part on the efficiency with which drug-receptor interaction is coupled to response. Note that some doses of drug A can produce larger effects than any dose of drug B, despite the fact that we describe drug B as pharmacologically more potent. The reason for this is that drug A has a larger maximal efficacy (as described below).
Document 7 (Title: Vitamin D Toxicity -- Epidemiology): According to the latest report from America's Poison Centers (APC), there were 11,718 cases of vitamin D exposure recorded in the National Poison Data System. More than half of these cases were in children younger than 5 years. The vast majority of cases were from unintentional exposures. The total number of vitamin D toxicity cases was greater than the total number of vitamin (vitamins B, A, C, and E) toxicity cases combined. This illustrates the widespread use of vitamin D supplements. [13]
Document 8 (Title: Neurology_Adams): A. Complete: No sensory or motor function below the level of the lesion including in the sacral segments. B. Sensory incomplete: Sensory function is preserved but motor function is lost below the zone of injury. C. Motor incomplete (first grade): Motor function is reduced in more than half of key muscles below the level of the lesion; this usually renders the patient unable to walk. (Reduced motor function is defined as active movement in a full range of motion only if gravity is eliminated.) D. Motor incomplete (second grade): Motor function is reduced in fewer than half of key muscles below the level of the lesion; this usually allows standing and walking. E. Normal: Reflexes may be abnormal. Obviously, groups C, D, and E have a more favorable prognosis for recovery of ambulation than does groups A and B. Even minimal preserved of sensation at the outset of injury (grade B), which is usually in the perineum, is associated with a better outcome than AIS grade A.

Fetus: Obtain periodic ultrasound and NSTs to assess fetal growth and wellbeing. It may be necessary to induce labor at 39–40 weeks. More than 50% of patients go on to develop glucose intolerance and/or type 2 DM later in life. T AB LE 2.1 1 -1 2.

Criterion H: The disturbance is not attributable to substance use, medication, or another medical illness. [47]
Document 12 (Title: Physiology, Liver -- Clinical Significance): A variety of viruses can lead to liver damage. Hepatitis viruses A and E lead to acute hepatitis without resulting in chronic hepatitis, although hepatitis E can lead to fulminant hepatitis in pregnant patients. Hepatitis A and E are typically seen in travelers and from contaminated water or seafood sources. They are usually self-limiting illnesses that present with jaundice and vomiting. [12] Hepatitis B, C, and D are viruses that can cause acute hepatitis that results in chronic hepatitis. Hepatitis D relies on hepatitis B for reproduction. It can either occur at the same time as hepatitis B, called coinfection or on top of hepatitis B, called superinfection. The distinction is important as superinfection can lead to more severe disease. Hepatitis B and C can both occur from contaminated needles, as in tattoos, intravenous drug use, or iatrogenically. [13] Hepatitis B can also be sexually transmitted. The best prevention for hepatitis A and B is vaccination, and IgG is a marker that shows vaccination or prior exposure, whereas IgM shows acute infection. There have been advancements in the treatment of hepatitis C to where it can be cured using combination antiviral agents like sofosbuvir/velpatasvir. [14]
Document 13 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): Alosetron is a highly potent and selective antagonist of the 5-HT3 receptor. It is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract with a bioavailability of 50–60% and has a plasma half-life of 1.5 hours but a much longer duration of effect. It undergoes extensive hepatic cytochrome P450 metabolism with renal excretion of most metabolites. Alosetron binds with higher affinity and dissociates more slowly from 5-HT3 receptors than other 5-HT3 antagonists, which may account for its long duration of action. Alosetron is approved for the treatment of women with severe IBS in whom diarrhea is the predominant symptom FIGURE 62–5 Chemical structure of serotonin; the 5-HT3 antagonists ondansetron, granisetron, dolasetron, and alosetron; and the 5-HT4 partial agonist tegaserod.
Document 14 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): B. Structure-Activity Characteristics of Local Anesthetics The smaller and more highly lipophilic local anesthetics have a faster rate of interaction with the sodium channel receptor. As previously noted, potency is also positively correlated with lipid solubility. Lidocaine, procaine, and mepivacaine are more water soluble than tetracaine, bupivacaine, and ropivacaine. The latter agents are more potent and have longer durations of local anesthetic action. These long-acting local anesthetics also bind more extensively to proteins and can be displaced from these binding sites by other protein-bound drugs. In the case of optically active agents (eg, bupivacaine), the R(+) isomer can usually be shown to be slightly more potent than the S(–) isomer (levobupivacaine). C. Neuronal Factors Affecting Block 1.
