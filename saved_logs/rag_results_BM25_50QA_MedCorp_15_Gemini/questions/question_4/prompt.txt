Document 1 (Title: Physiology, Pituitary Hormones -- Mechanism -- Growth Hormone): Growth Hormone has a direct and indirect mechanism of action. The direct effect of growth hormone involves growth hormone directly binding to its receptors on target cells to stimulate a response. The indirect effect is mediated by the action of insulin-like growth factor-1(IGF-1), which is secreted by the liver hepatocytes in response to growth hormone. Insulin-like growth factor-1 binds to its receptor, IGF-1R, on the cellular surface. It activates a tyrosine kinase-mediated intracellular signaling pathway that phosphorylates various proteins intracellularly, leading to increased anabolism, cellular replication and division, and metabolism. [2]
Document 2 (Title: Pediatrics_Nelson): The hypothalamus controls many endocrine systems either directly or through the pituitary gland. Higher central nervoussystem (CNS) centers control the hypothalamus. Hypothalamicreleasing or inhibiting factors travel through capillaries of the pituitary portal system to control the anterior pituitary gland,regulating the hormones specific for the factor (Fig. 170-2).The pituitary hormones enter the peripheral circulation andexert their effects on target glands, which produce other hormones that feed back to suppress their controlling hypothalamicand pituitary hormones. Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1),growth hormone (GH), cortisol, sex steroids, and thyroxine (T4)all feed back on the hypothalamic-pituitary system. Prolactin isthe only pituitary hormone that is suppressed by a hypothalamicfactor, dopamine. The hypothalamus is also the location of vasopressin-secreting axons that either terminate in the posteriorpituitary gland and exert their effect via vasopressin secretion
Document 3 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): may be a novel therapeutic strategy for preventing early PMN activation and subsequent organ failure in severely injured patients.Growth Hormone, Insulin-Like Growth Factor, and Ghrelin. Growth hormone (GH) is a neurohormone expressed primarily by the pituitary gland that has both metabolic and immunomodulatory effects. GH promotes both protein synthe-sis and insulin resistance while enhancing the mobilization of fat stores. GH secretion is upregulated by hypothalamic GH–releasing hormone and downregulated by somatostatin. GH pri-marily exerts its downstream effects through direct interaction with GH receptors and through the enhanced hepatic synthesis of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), an anabolic growth fac-tor that is known to improve the metabolic rate, gut mucosal function, and protein loss after traumatic injury. Less than 5% of IGF-1 circulates free in the plasma, with the remainder bound principally to one of six IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs), the majority to IGFBP-3.
Document 4 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): signaling cascades mediated by receptor-associated JAK tyrosine kinases and STATs (see Chapter 2). The hormone has complex effects on growth, body composition, and carbohydrate, protein, and lipid metabolism. The growth-promoting effects are mediated principally, but not solely, through an increase in the production of IGF-I. Much of the circulating IGF-I is produced by the liver. Growth hormone also stimulates production of IGF-I in bone, cartilage, muscle, kidney, and other tissues, where it has autocrine or paracrine roles. It stimulates longitudinal bone growth until the epiphyseal plates fuse—near the end of puberty. In both children and adults, GH has anabolic effects in muscle and catabolic effects in adipose cells that shift the balance of body mass to an increase in muscle mass and a reduction in adiposity. The direct and indirect effects of GH on carbohydrate metabolism are mixed, in part because GH and IGF-I have opposite effects on insulin sensitivity. Growth hormone
Document 5 (Title: Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 1 -- Evaluation -- Anterior Pituitary Gland): Evaluation of pituitary gland tumors involves measurement of pituitary hormones, including prolactin (PRL), growth hormone (GH), insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), thyroxine (T4), and cortisol levels. [7] These tumors most commonly secrete prolactin, followed by growth hormone. Serial basal PRL levels greater than 200 ng/ml confirm a prolactinoma. Elevated IGF-1 levels with the failure of GH suppression during an oral glucose tolerance test confirm a GH-secreting adenoma. Non-secreting pituitary tumors can cause hypopituitarism by compression of the pituitary gland. MRI of the pituitary gland with contrast is the best diagnostic imaging. Thin cuts through the pituitary gland should be completed to avoid missing smaller-sized tumors. Pituitary MRI is also used to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment during follow-up of pituitary tumors.

Document 7 (Title: Physiology, Bone Remodeling -- Mechanism -- Growth Hormone): Growth Hormone (GH), a peptide hormone secreted by the pituitary gland, acts through insulin-like growth factors (IGF) to stimulate bone formation and resorption. GH acts directly and indirectly via IGF to stimulate osteoblast proliferation and activity. It also stimulates osteoclastic bone resorption activity; the cumulative net effect of this dual activity favors bone formation. [9]
Document 8 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): and a reduction in adiposity. The direct and indirect effects of GH on carbohydrate metabolism are mixed, in part because GH and IGF-I have opposite effects on insulin sensitivity. Growth hormone reduces insulin sensitivity, which results in mild hyperinsulinemia and increased blood glucose levels, whereas IGF-I has insulin-like effects on glucose transport. In patients who are unable to respond to growth hormone because of severe resistance (caused by GH receptor mutations, post-receptor signaling mutations, or GH antibodies), the administration of recombinant human IGF-I may cause hypoglycemia because of its insulin-like effects.
Document 9 (Title: Dwarfism -- Etiology): 4. Endocrine disorders: Growth hormone deficiency is a frequent cause of dwarfism. The hypothalamic-pituitary axis maintains the levels of growth hormones in the body, which then directly or indirectly, through Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), stimulates bone elongation, and growth of soft tissue and cartilage. Lower levels of IGF-1 are linked with short stature. Precocious puberty is defined as the attainment of puberty before the age of 8 years in girls and nine years in boys due to the premature release of gonadotropins centrally or peripherally. These gonadotropins lead to an initial growth spurt but also lead to the early maturation of the child's skeletal system resulting in short adult height. [3]

Document 11 (Title: Histology, Chondrocytes -- Function -- Mechanism): Proper endocrine balance is also crucial for chondral functioning. The hypophyseal growth hormone, known as somatotropin, mainly dictates cartilage growth. This hormone indirectly contributes to chondral growth by stimulating the production of somatomedin C in the liver. Somatomedin C directly promotes chondral growth. Testosterone, growth hormone (GH), and thyroxin expedite the production of chondral proteoglycans comprised of sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). GAG production can become inhibited via hydrocortisone, estradiol, and cortisone.
Document 12 (Title: Physiology, Endocrine Hormones -- Issues of Concern -- Anterior Pituitary): Upon GH binding its receptor, primarily found in the liver, a phosphorylation cascade involving the JAK/STAT pathway is activated. The prevailing action is to stimulate the liver to synthesize and secrete IGF-1. IGF-1 is an extremely critical protein induced by GH and is believed to be responsible for most of the growth properties of GH. Some of the specific effects of GH include stimulation of linear growth in children, increased lipolysis, increased protein synthesis, retention of phosphate, sodium, and water, and antagonism of insulin. Again, most of these actions are believed to be from GH in tandem with IGF-1. [45] [52] [53]
Document 13 (Title: Histology_Ross): An increase in parathyroid hormone (PTH) level promotes bone resorption and has a demonstrable effect on osteoclast activity, in addition to its effects on osteocytes, described previously. In contrast, calcitonin, secreted by parafollicular cells of the thyroid gland, has a counterbalancing effect, reducing osteoclast activity. PTH has also anabolic effect on bone either through a direct stimulatory effect on osteoblasts or indirectly through a mechanism that requires it to increase activity of osteoclasts. For example, PTH might stimulate bone formation directly by increasing the local production of IGF I or other bone-stimulating growth factors.
Document 14 (Title: Physiology, Puberty -- Development): The growth spurt results from interactions between sex steroids (estradiol/testosterone), growth hormone, and IGF-1. The rise in sex steroids leads to an increase in growth hormone levels, which causes an increase in IGF-1. IGF-1 causes somatic growth via its metabolic actions (e.g., increases trabecular bone growth). Following the growth spurt in males, the larynx and vocal cords enlarge, and the boy's voice may 'crack' as it deepens in pitch. [7]
Document 15 (Title: Multiple Endocrine Neoplasias Type 4 -- Evaluation -- Pituitary Gland): Evaluation of the pituitary gland is mainly limited to undertaking biochemical testing of anterior pituitary hormones; these include growth hormone (GH), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), cortisol, ACTH, prolactin (PRL), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and thyroxine (T4). As mentioned above, acromegaly and Cushing disease are more common in MEN4.
