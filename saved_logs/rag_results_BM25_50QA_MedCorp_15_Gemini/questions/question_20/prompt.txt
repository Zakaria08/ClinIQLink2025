Document 1 (Title: Ethylene Glycol Toxicity -- Epidemiology): Individuals at risk include toddlers and young children exploring their environment, patients with alcohol use disorder, and individuals wanting to end their lives. [1] According to the Annual Report of the American Association of Poison Control Centers' National Poison Data System, the number of case mentions of ethylene glycol in 2016 was 6,374. Most of these cases were intentional in adults older than 20. [4] Children younger than 12 comprised 686 of the 6374 cases, with 13 unknown child-age cases. [4]
Document 2 (Title: Physiology, Acid Base Balance -- Pathophysiology -- Increased Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis): The mnemonic MUDPILES has classically been used to teach students the causes of high anion gap metabolic acidosis. MUDPILES stands for methanol, uremia, diabetic ketoacidosis, paraldehyde, infection, lactic acidosis, ethylene glycol, and salicylates. A new mnemonic, GOLDMARK, has been suggested to be an improvement. GOLDMARK is an anagram for glycols (ethylene and propylene), oxoproline, lactate, methanol, aspirin, renal failure, and ketones. If a patient has an anion gap over 12, these mnemonics are helpful to remember the possible causes of the disorder. [7] [8]
Document 3 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): Three stages of ethylene glycol overdose occur. Within the first few hours after ingestion, there is transient excitation followed by CNS depression. After a delay of 4–12 hours, severe metabolic acidosis develops from accumulation of acid metabolites and lactate. Finally, deposition of oxalate crystals in renal tubules occurs, followed by delayed renal insufficiency. The key to the diagnosis of ethylene glycol poisoning is recognition of anion gap acidosis, osmolar gap, and oxalate crystals in the urine in a patient without visual symptoms.
Document 4 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): APPROACH TO THE PATIENT: There are four principal causes of a high-AG acidosis: (1) lactic acidosis, (2) ketoacidosis, (3) ingested toxins, and (4) acute and chronic renal failure (Table 66-4). Initial screening to differentiate the high-AG acidoses should include (1) a probe of the history for evidence of drug and toxin ingestion and measurement of arterial blood gas to detect coexistent respiratory alkalosis (salicylates); (2) determination of whether diabetes mellitus is present (diabetic ketoacidosis); (3) a search for evidence of alcoholism or increased levels of β-hydroxybutyrate (alcoholic ketoacidosis); (4) observation for clinical signs of uremia and determination of the blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (uremic acidosis); (5) inspection of the urine for oxalate crystals (ethylene glycol); and (6) recognition of the numerous clinical settings in which lactate levels may be increased (hypotension, shock, cardiac failure, leukemia, cancer, and drug or toxin ingestion).
Document 5 (Title: Psichiatry_DSM-5): Intermittent explosive disorder. Intermittent explosive disorder also involves high rates of anger. However, individuals with this disorder show serious aggression toward others that is not part of the definition of oppositional defiant disorder. Intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder). In individuals with intel- lectual disability, a diagnosis of oppositional defiant disorder is given only if the opposi- tional behavior is markedly greater than is commonly observed among individuals of comparable mental age and with comparable severity of intellectual disability. Language disorder. Oppositional defiant disorder must also be distinguished from a failure to follow directions that is the result of impaired language comprehension (e.g., hearing loss). Social anxiety disorder (social phobia). Oppositional defiant disorder must also be dis- tinguished from defiance due to fear of negative evaluation associated with social anxiety disorder.
Document 6 (Title: Antidotes -- Issues of Concern -- Background and Presentation): Ethylene glycol and methanol : Poisoning with ethylene glycol or methanol may occur through attempted self-harm, unintentional ingestion, or a misguided attempt at inebriation. In 2007, United States poison centers received a combined 8014 calls related to possible ethylene glycol or methanol exposure. [11] Ethylene glycol, an essential component of antifreeze, has a bright color and sweet taste, making it particularly appealing to children. Classic signs and symptoms of ethylene glycol poisoning include altered mental state, metabolic acidosis, acute renal failure, and oxalate crystals in the urine. Hypocalcemia, multiorgan dysfunction, and even death occur in severe cases. [11] Methanol is present in embalming fluids, paint removers, windshield-washer fluid, canned-heating products, and moonshine liquor. Methanol poisoning causes profound metabolic acidosis and visual changes that may lead to blindness. Severe cases can result in multiorgan failure and death. Untreated methanol poisoning carries a mortality rate as high as 28% with permanent visual defects or blindness in up to 30% of survivors. [11]
Document 7 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): For control of ethanol or other sedative-hypnotic withdrawal states widely used for the management of acute anxiety states and for rapid control of panic attacks. They are also used, though less commonly, in the long-term management of GAD and panic disorders. Anxiety symptoms may be relieved by many benzodiazepines, but it is not always easy to demonstrate the superiority of one drug over another. Alprazolam has been used in the treatment of panic disorders and agoraphobia and appears to be more selective in these conditions than other benzodiazepines. The choice of benzodiazepines for anxiety is based on several sound pharmacologic principles: (1) a rapid onset of action; (2) a relatively high therapeutic index (see drug B in Figure 22–1), plus availability of flumazenil for treatment of overdose; (3) a low risk of drug interactions based on liver enzyme induction; and (4) minimal effects on cardiovascular or autonomic functions.
Document 8 (Title: Biochemistry_Lippinco): Enzymes have diagnostic and therapeutic value in medicine. Choose the ONE best answer. .1. In cases of ethylene glycol poisoning and its characteristic metabolic acidosis, treatment involves correction of the acidosis, removal of any remaining ethylene glycol, and administration of an inhibitor of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), the enzyme that oxidizes ethylene glycol to the organic acids that cause the acidosis. Ethanol (grain alcohol) frequently is the inhibitor given to treat ethylene glycol poisoning. Results of experiments using ADH with and without ethanol are shown to the right. Based on these data, what type of inhibition is caused by the ethanol? A. Competitive B. Feedback C. Irreversible D. Noncompetitive
Document 9 (Title: La Belle Indifference -- Introduction): The term “la belle indifference” is a French term that translates to “beautiful ignorance.” [1] La belle indifference is defined as a paradoxical absence of psychological distress despite a serious medical illness or symptoms of a health condition. [2] This condition is most commonly associated with conversion disorder. According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders V (DSM 5), conversion disorder is also referred to as functional neurologic symptom disorder (FNSD). FNSD, or conversion disorder, is characterized by at least 1 neurological deficit with no medical or neurological etiology and is incompatible with any known medical or neurological disorders. Psychological distress or conflict may be manifested as a physical symptom in patients with conversion disorder. La belle indifference is not formally included in DSM 5 as a diagnosis. However, it is used in conjunction with conversion disorder. [3]
Document 10 (Title: Ethylene Glycol Toxicity -- Pearls and Other Issues): Osmolar and anion gaps absolutely cannot be relied upon to rule out toxic alcohol poisoning. Ethylene glycol undergoes multiple metabolic steps, with metabolites glycolic acid and oxalic acid primarily responsible for acidosis and renal injury. End-organ toxicity primarily includes nephropathy secondary to the deposition of calcium oxalate crystals. Ethylene glycol is osmotically active, while its metabolites are responsible for the associated anion gap metabolic acidosis. A normal osmolar gap is not reassuring and should be anticipated in the presence of an anion gap acidosis believed to be related to toxic alcohol poisoning. The mainstay of treatment is fomepizole, supportive care, and resuscitation. However, dialysis may be indicated. Without end-organ toxicity, ethylene glycol toxicity generally does not require dialysis. When patients survive and have resulting renal dysfunction or failure, recovery of renal function is the norm but may take weeks to months.
Document 11 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Ethylene glycol is commonly available as antifreeze or solvents and may be ingested accidently or as a suicide attempt. The metabolism of ethylene glycol by alcohol dehydrogenase generates acids such as glycoaldehyde, glycolic acid, and oxalic acid. The initial effects of intoxication are on the CNS and, in the earliest stages, mimic inebriation, but may quickly progress to full-blown coma. Delay in treatment is one of the most common causes of mortality with toxic alcohol poisoning. The kidney shows evidence of acute tubular injury with widespread deposition of calcium oxalate crystals within tubular epithelial cells. Cerebral edema is common, as is crystal deposition in the brain; the latter is irreversible.
Document 12 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): High-dose oxygen; IV hydroxocobalamin or IV sodium nitrite and sodium thiosulfate (Lilly cyanide antidote kit) for coma, metabolic acidosis, and cardiovascular dysfunction in cyanide poisoning High-dose oxygen; IV methylene blue for methemoglobin fraction >30%, symptomatic hypoxemia, or ischemia (contraindicated in G6PD deficiency); exchange transfusion and hyperbaric oxygen for severe or refractory cases Sodium bicarbonate to correct acidemia; thiamine, folinic acid, magnesium, and high-dose pyridoxine to facilitate metabolism; ethanol or fomepizole for AGMA, crystalluria or renal dysfunction, ethylene glycol level >3 mmol/L (20 mg/ dL), and ethanol-like intoxication or increased osmolal gap if level not readily obtainable; hemodialysis for persistent AGMA, lack of clinical improvement, and renal dysfunction; hemodialysis also useful for enhancing ethylene glycol elimination and shortening duration of treatment when ethylene glycol level is >8 mmol/L (50 mg/dL)
Document 13 (Title: Psychosis -- Introduction): Psychosis is an amalgamation of psychological symptoms resulting in a loss of contact with reality. The current thinking is that although around 1.5 to 3.5% of people will meet diagnostic criteria for a psychotic disorder, a significantly larger, variable number will experience at least one psychotic symptom in their lifetime. [1] Psychosis is a common feature to many psychiatric, neuropsychiatric, [2] [3] [4] neurologic, neurodevelopmental, and medical conditions. It is the hallmark feature of schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders, a co-occurring aspect to many mood and substance use disorders, [5] as well as a challenging symptom to many neurologic and medical conditions. Psychosis can result in high levels of distress for patients and loved ones, which is why it has become a primary target of treatment for medical professionals.
Document 14 (Title: Psichiatry_DSM-5): Speech sound disorder is thus heterogeneous in its underlying mechanisms and includes pho- nological disorder and articulation disorder. A speech sound disorder is diagnosed when speech sound production is not what would be expected based on the child’s age and devel- opmental stage and when the deficits are not the result of a physical, structural, neurological, or hearing impairment. Among typically developing children at age 4 years, overall speech should be intelligible, whereas at age 2 years, only 50% may be understandable. Language disorder, particularly expressive deficits, may be found to co-occur with speech sound disorder. A positive family history of speech or language disorders is often present.
