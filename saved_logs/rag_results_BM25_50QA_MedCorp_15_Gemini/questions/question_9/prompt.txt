Document 1 (Title: Biochemistry, Fatty Acid Oxidation -- Fundamentals): Mitochondrial beta-oxidation can be used to supply acetyl coenzyme A (CoA) to 2 separate pathways, depending on which tissue oxidation occurs. In skeletal and cardiac muscle, mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation leads to substrate production for the tricarboxylic acid cycle in the form of acetyl CoA and provides adenosine triphosphate (ATP) for the myocytes. However, in hepatocytes, fatty acid oxidation provides acetyl CoA for ketone body synthesis during prolonged fasting conditions, in which glycogen stores have been depleted. Mitochondrial beta-oxidation yields 4 ATP equivalents per round of oxidation in the form of one flavin adenine dinucleotide, FAD(2H) molecule and 1 nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (reduced, NADH) molecule, as well as one acetyl CoA molecule.
Document 2 (Title: Biochemistry_Lippinco): 7.2. Which one of the following statements concerning dietary fat is correct? A. Coconut oil is rich in monounsaturated fats, and olive oil is rich in saturated fats. B. Fatty acids containing trans double bonds, unlike the naturally occurring cis isomers, raise high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. C. The polyunsaturated fatty acids linoleic and linolenic acids are required components. D. Triacylglycerols obtained from plants generally contain less unsaturated fatty acids than do those from animals. Correct answer = C. Humans are unable to make linoleic and linolenic fatty acids. Consequently, these fatty acids are essential in the diet. Coconut oil is rich in saturated fats, and olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fats. Trans fatty acids raise plasma levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, not high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Triacylglycerols obtained from plants generally contain more unsaturated fatty acids than do those from animals.
Document 3 (Title: Biochemistry_Lippinco): Unsaturated fatty acid β-oxidation: The oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids generates intermediates that cannot serve as substrates for 2,3-enoyl CoA hydratase (see Fig. 16.17). Consequently, additional enzymes are required. Oxidation of a double bond at an odd-numbered carbon, such as 18:1(9) (oleic acid), requires one additional enzyme, 3,2-enoyl CoA isomerase, which converts the 3-cis derivative obtained after three rounds of β-oxidation to the 2-trans derivative required by the hydratase. Oxidation of a double bond at an even-numbered carbon, such as 18:2(9,12) (linoleic acid), requires an NADPH-dependent 2,4-dienoyl CoA reductase in addition to the isomerase. [Note: Because unsaturated fatty acids are less reduced than saturated fatty acids, fewer reducing equivalents are produced by their oxidation.] 8.
Document 4 (Title: Vitamin B5 (Pantothenic Acid) -- Indications -- Discovery and Isolation): The molecule's chemical structure was determined by Williams in 1940. Elvehjem et al and Jukes et al demonstrated that pantothenic acid was a growth and "anti-dermatitis" factor for chickens. In the 1950s, one of the functional forms of pantothenic acid, coenzyme A (CoA), was discovered as the cofactor essential for the acetylation of sulfonamides and choline. In the mid-1960s, pantothenic acid was identified as a component of an acyl carrier protein (ACP) in the fatty acid synthesis complex. Fritz Albert Lipmann won the Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine "for his discovery of coenzyme A and its importance for intermediary metabolism." [2] All genomes sequenced to date encode enzymes that use coenzyme A as a substrate, the biosynthesis of which requires cysteine, pantothenate (vitamin B5), and adenosine triphosphate (ATP). [3]
Document 5 (Title: Biochemistry, Fatty Acid Oxidation -- Molecular Level): Step 1. The first enzyme required is called acyl CoA dehydrogenase, and like other enzymes involved in the handling of fatty acids, it is specific to chain length. Members of this enzyme family include long-chain, medium-chain, and short-chain acyl CoA dehydrogenases (LCAD), (MCAD), and (SCAD), respectively. These enzymes catalyze the formation of a trans double bond between the alpha and beta carbons on acyl CoA molecules by removing two electrons to produce one molecule of FAD(H2), which eventually accounts for 1.5 ATP molecules produced in the electron transport chain (ETC).
Document 6 (Title: Biochemistry_Lippinco): C. is reversible. D. occurs in the cytosol. E. requires the coenzyme biotin. Correct answer = A. Lipoic acid is an intermediate acceptor of the acetyl group formed in the reaction. [Note: Lipoic acid linked to a lysine residue in E2 functions as a “swinging arm” that allows interaction with E1 and E3.] The PDHC catalyzes an irreversible reaction that is inhibited when the decarboxylase component (E1) is phosphorylated. The PDHC is located in the mitochondrial matrix. Biotin is utilized by carboxylases, not decarboxylases. .2. Which one of the following conditions decreases the oxidation of acetyl coenzyme A by the citric acid cycle? A. A high availability of calcium B. A high acetyl CoA/CoA ratio C. A low ATP/ADP ratio D. A low NAD+/NADH ratio Correct answer = D. A low NAD+/NADH (oxidized to reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) ratio limits the rates of the NAD+-requiring dehydrogenases. High availability of calcium and substrate (acetyl coenzyme
Document 7 (Title: Biochemistry_Lippinco): A fatty acid, generally a linear hydrocarbon chain with a terminal carboxyl group, can be saturated or unsaturated. Two unsaturated fatty acids are dietary essentials: linoleic and α-linolenic acids. Fatty acids are synthesized in the liver cytosol following a meal containing excess carbohydrate and protein. Carbons used to synthesize fatty acids are provided by acetyl coenzyme A (CoA), energy by ATP, and reducing equivalents by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate ([NADPH], Fig. 16.25) provided by the pentose phosphate pathway and malic enzyme. Citrate carries two-carbon acetyl units from the mitochondrial matrix to the cytosol. The regulated step in fatty acid synthesis is the carboxylation of acetyl CoA to malonyl CoA by biotin-and ATP-requiring acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC). Citrate allosterically activates ACC, and palmitoyl CoA inhibits it. ACC can also be activated by insulin and inactivated by adenosine monophosphate–activated protein kinase (AMPK) in response to
Document 8 (Title: Vitamin B3 -- Mechanism of Action): Niacin is necessary for adequate cellular metabolism and is a vital component in coenzyme 1 (the oxidized state of NAD) and coenzyme 2 (the reduced form of NADP), which either accept or donate hydrogen ions in essential oxidation-reduction reactions. These coenzymes are important for glycolysis, pyruvate metabolism, protein, amino acid metabolism, pentose biosynthesis, glycerol metabolism, synthesis of high-energy phosphate bonds, and fatty acid metabolism. [2]
Document 9 (Title: Biochemistry, Fatty Acid Oxidation -- Molecular Level): Steps 1 through 4 refer to the beta-oxidation of a saturated fatty acid with an even-numbered carbon skeleton. Unsaturated fatty acids, such as oleate (18:1) and linoleate (18:2), contain cis double bonds that must be isomerized to the trans configuration (enoyl CoA isomerase) or reduced at the expense of an NADPH molecule (2,4-dienoyl CoA reductase).
Document 10 (Title: Biochemistry_Lippinco): = eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5); DHA = docosahexaenoic acid (22:6). 4. Trans fatty acids: Trans fatty acids (Fig. 27.13) are chemically classified as unsaturated fatty acids but behave more like saturated fatty acids in the body because they elevate LDL-C and lower HDL-C, thereby increasing the risk of CHD. Trans fatty acids do not occur naturally in plants but occur in small amounts in animals. However, trans fatty acids are formed during the hydrogenation of vegetable oils (for example, in the manufacture of margarine and partially hydrogenated vegetable oil). Trans fatty acids are a major component of many commercial baked goods, such as cookies, and most deep-fried foods. Many manufacturers have reformulated their products to be free of trans fats. In 2006, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration required that Nutrition Facts labels (see p. 370) portray the trans fat content of packaged food. By 2018, virtually no industrial trans fatty acids will be permitted in food.
Document 11 (Title: Biochemistry_Lippinco): In addition to transketolase, TPP is required by the multienzyme complexes pyruvate dehydrogenase (see p. 110), α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase of the tricarboxylic acid cycle (see p. 112), and branched-chain α-keto acid dehydrogenase of branched-chain amino acid catabolism (see p. 266). IV. NADPH USES The coenzyme NADPH differs from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) only by the presence of a phosphate group on one of the ribose units (Fig. 13.4). This seemingly small change in structure allows NADPH to interact with NADPH-specific enzymes that have unique roles in the cell. For example, in the cytosol of hepatocytes, the steady-state NADP+/NADPH ratio is ~0.1, which favors the use of NADPH in reductive biosynthetic reactions. This contrasts with the high NAD+/NADH ratio (~1,000), which favors an oxidative role for NAD+. This section summarizes some important NADPH-specific functions in reductive biosynthesis and detoxification reactions. A. Reductive biosynthesis
Document 12 (Title: Physiology, Krebs Cycle -- Function -- Oxidative Decarboxylation of Alpha-ketoglutarate): The conversion of alpha-ketoglutarate to succinyl-CoA is catalyzed by the alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex producing NADH, CO2, and H+. The function of the alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex is analogous to PDC. Alpha-ketoglutarate becomes decarboxylated by E1 of this complex, transferring the 4 remaining carbons to thiamine pyrophosphate. Thiamine pyrophosphate is the first cofactor. Then, the succinyl group is transferred to CoASH by E2 with the help of FAD. The final step involves the resynthesis of FAD and NADH from NAD+ by E3. This last step ensures the maintenance of substrates and cofactors required to continue the dehydrogenase complex activity. The cofactors necessary for alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex include thiamine pyrophosphate, lipoic acid, coenzyme A, NAD+, and FAD. Succinyl-CoA, NADH, and ATP inhibit the alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex. [8] [9]
Document 13 (Title: Carnitine Deficiency -- Pathophysiology): Under normal physiological conditions, fatty acids are the main source of energy during fasting. [6] Energy production from fatty acids occurs via beta-oxidation of fatty acids in the liver, heart, and skeletal muscles. [6] Beta oxidation of the long-chain fatty acid (LCFAs) occurs exclusively in the mitochondrial matrix. The mitochondrial membrane is impermeable to LCFAs and requires the obligatory carnitine shuttle (Figure). To be transported across the mitochondrial membrane, LCFAs are activated in the cytoplasm by conversion to long-chain fatty acyl-CoAs (LCFA-CoAs). This reaction is catalyzed by long-chain fatty acyl-CoA synthetase. [5] LCFA-CoAs then can diffuse through the outer mitochondrial membrane where they are converted to acylcarnitine in a presence of carnitine by the enzyme carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 (CPT-I). In normal states, acylcarnitine formation reduces the proportion of acyl residues combined with coenzyme A (CoA) and improves the ratio between free CoA and acyl-CoAs. [6] Acylcarnitine crosses the inner mitochondrial membrane by the carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase (CACT) via the carnitine shuttle. In the mitochondrial matrix, acylcarnitine is converted back to LCFA-CoAs and free carnitine by the carnitine palmitoyltransferase-2 (CPT-II). When acylcarnitine crosses the inner mitochondrial membrane, simultaneously the free carnitine released by the CPT-II leaves the mitochondrial matrix by the action of CACT and this termed as the carnitine shuttle. Once they are inside the mitochondrial matrix, LCFA-CoAs are readily oxidized and results in acetyl-CoA production. Acetyl-CoA is subsequently used for energy and ketone bodies production. Acetyl-CoA is also an allosteric activator of pyruvate carboxylase that catalyzes the gluconeogenesis pathway which is active during catabolic states such as fasting. [6] [15] [16]
Document 14 (Title: Biochemistry_Lippinco): 0.5. Which one of the following statements concerning amino acids is correct? A. Alanine is ketogenic. B. Amino acids that are catabolized to acetyl coenzyme A are glucogenic. C. Branched-chain amino acids are catabolized primarily in the liver. D. Cysteine is essential for individuals consuming a diet severely limited in methionine. Correct answer = D. Methionine is the precursor of cysteine, which becomes essential if methionine is severely restricted. Alanine is a key glucogenic amino acid. Acetyl coenzyme A (CoA) cannot be used for the net synthesis of glucose. Amino acids catabolized to acetyl CoA are ketogenic. Branched-chain amino acids are catabolized primarily in skeletal muscle. 0.6. In an individual with the dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase (E3)-deficient form of maple syrup urine disease, why would lactic acidosis be an expected finding?
Document 15 (Title: Biochemistry, Fatty Acid Oxidation -- Introduction): Oxidation of fatty acids occurs in multiple regions of the cell within the human body; the mitochondria, in which only beta-oxidation occurs; the peroxisome, where alpha- and beta-oxidation occur; and omega-oxidation, which occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum. Beta-oxidation is a significant source of metabolic energy during interprandial periods and high energy demand states, such as exercise. [1] These metabolic conditions induce the release of fatty acids from adipose tissue due to the secretion of circulating mediators, such as epinephrine and glucagon, which increase the rate of lipolysis. [2] This metabolic pathway provides a large portion of the energy requirement of skeletal muscle, heart muscle, and kidneys when glycogen and gluconeogenic precursors become scarce. Thus, fatty acid oxidation provides an alternative mode of high-efficiency energy production while simultaneously sparing muscles from catabolic breakdown. [1] Other forms of fatty acid oxidation mentioned above are primarily designed to rid the body of large, insoluble xenobiotic compounds and lipid-based cellular components, such as sphingolipids and plasma membrane constituents.
