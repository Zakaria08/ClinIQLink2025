Document 1 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Push enteroscopy is performed with a long endoscope similar in design to an upper endoscope. The enteroscope is pushed down the small bowel, sometimes with the help of a stiffening overtube that extends from the mouth to the small intestine. The proximal to mid-jejunum is usually reached, and the instrument channel of the endoscope allows for biopsy or endoscopic therapy. Deeper insertion into the small bowel can be accomplished by single-or double-balloon enteroscopy or spiral enteroscopy (Fig. 345-9). These instruments enable pleating of the small intestine onto an over-tube (see Video 346e-1). With balloon-assisted enteroscopy, the entire intestinal tract can be visualized in some patients when both the oral and anal routes of insertion are used. Biopsies and endoscopic therapy can be performed throughout the visualized small bowel (Fig. 345-10).
Document 2 (Title: Small Bowel Bleeding -- Evaluation -- Push Enteroscopy): Push enteroscopy or double-balloon enteroscopy is a new advancement to standard endoscopes. They have been used when the lesion is farther down in the small bowel and not seen with the standard endoscopes. It uses two balloons, which can help the scope be pushed farther into the small bowel. [22] It is possible to see the lesions, as far as the ileum, depending upon the performer's expertise. The advantage is the ability to treat, take biopsies and mark the area with the tattoo. Studies have shown that the enteroscope has identified the bleeding source in about 74% of patients and treated about 60% to 70%. [23]
Document 3 (Title: A Review of Hereditary Colorectal Cancers -- Etiology -- High-Penetrance Genetic Syndromes): Hamartomatous polyps in the small bowel are usually diagnosed with small-bowel capsule endoscopy or double-balloon enteroscopy. Double-balloon enteroscopy also enables therapeutic interventions, such as polypectomy. These lesions may lead to several complications, such as bleeding, obstruction, and intussusception. The risk of colorectal, gastric, small bowel, and pancreatic cancers is elevated, [37] [38] with the incidence of cancer rising significantly after age 50. [39] Screening for pancreatic cancer using endoscopic ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography is recommended in adults. [40] The diagnosis is established based on the following criteria: [41]
Document 4 (Title: Angiodysplasia -- Evaluation): Small bowel angiodysplasia as a source of obscure GI bleeding may require further evaluation with wireless video capsule endoscopy or deep bowel enteroscopy (single or double-balloon enteroscopy) if the initial workup is negative.
Document 5 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): Other etiologies of obscure GI bleeding include Crohn’s dis-ease, infectious enteritides, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-induced ulcers and erosions, vasculitis, ischemia, var-ices, diverticuli, and intussusception.The diagnostic evaluation of patients with obscure GI bleeding should be tailored to the severity to bleeding and to the availability of technology and expertise. Enteroscopy is playing an increasingly important role. Several endoscopic techniques for visualizing the small intestine are available: push enteros-copy, sonde enteroscopy, intraoperative enteroscopy, double balloon endoscopy, and wireless capsule enteroscopy.Push enteroscopy entails advancing a long endoscope (such as a pediatric or adult colonoscope or a specialized instru-ment) beyond the ligament of Treitz into the proximal jejunum. This procedure can allow for visualization of approximately 60 cm of the proximal jejunum. Diagnostic yield in patients with obscure GI bleeding ranges from 3% to
Document 6 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): If capsule endoscopy is positive, management is dictated by the finding. If capsule endoscopy is negative, current recommendations suggest patients may either be observed or, if their clinical course mandates (e.g., recurrent bleeding, need for transfusions or hospitalization), undergo further testing. “Deep” enteroscopy (e.g., double-balloon, single-balloon, and spiral enteroscopy) is commonly the next test undertaken in patients with clinically important obscure GIB because it allows the endoscopist to examine, obtain specimens from, and provide therapy to much or all of the small intestine. CT and magnetic resonance enterography also are used to examine the small intestine. Other imaging techniques sometimes used in evaluation of obscure GIB include 99mTc-labeled red blood cell scintigraphy, multidetector CT “angiography,” angiography, and 99mTc-pertechnetate scintigraphy for Meckel’s diverticulum (especially in young patients). If all tests are unrevealing, intraoperative
Document 7 (Title: Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass Chronic Complications -- Issues of Concern -- Choledocholithiasis): Patients may present with stones in the common bile duct and resultant cholangitis or pancreatitis. A useful diagnostic tool would be MRCP in this setting. The usual treatment, conventional ERCP, is not feasible since the duodenum is excluded and connected to the remnant stomach. Options in this situation are double-balloon enteroscopy, laparoscopic-assisted ERCP with a remnant stomach gastrostomy, percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography, and open common bile duct exploration. [8]
Document 8 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): and inflammatory bowel disease. Sigmoidoscopy examines the colon up to the splenic flexure and is currently used to exclude distal colonic inflammation or obstruction in young patients not at significant risk for colon cancer. For elusive GI bleeding secondary to arteriovenous malformations or superficial ulcers, small-intestinal examination is performed with push enteroscopy, capsule endoscopy, or double-balloon enteroscopy. Capsule endoscopy also can visualize small-intestinal Crohn’s disease in individuals with negative barium radiography. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreaticography (ERCP) provides diagnoses of pancreatic and biliary disease. Endoscopic ultrasound is useful for evaluating extent of disease in GI malignancy as well as exclusion of choledocholithiasis, evaluation of pancreatitis, drainage of pancreatic pseudocysts, and assessment of anal continuity.
Document 9 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): the extent of a previous surgical resection. Other imaging studies that assess the integrity of small-intestinal morphology are CT enterography and magnetic resonance enterography. Capsule endoscopy and double-balloon enteroscopy are other useful aids in the diagnostic assessment of small-intestinal pathology.
Document 10 (Title: Small Bowel Cancer -- Evaluation -- Imaging): Endoscopic Evaluation: Endoscopic evaluation of small bowel cancers helps identify mucosal lesions that may not be identified on routine imaging modalities. It can assist in the diagnosis of lesions that are up to the proximal duodenum. Push enteroscopy can help access the GI tract beyond the ligament of Treitz using push or double-balloon enteroscopy techniques. This allows for the traditional scope to visualize a more extensive portion of the small bowel which can help in identifying more distal lesions. Wireless video capsule endoscopy can also be utilized to evaluate the distal small bowel. However, it only allows for tissue visualization and no tissue sampling, which requires more invasive procedures for final diagnosis to be established. [22]
Document 11 (Title: Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography -- Equipment): The side-viewing duodenoscope is considered the standard for ERCP procedure as it allows a better view of the major duodenal papilla, rendering cannulation easier. In patients with reconstructed gastrointestinal anatomy, as in patients with Billroth II gastrectomy or Roux-en-Y operation, the afferent loop entrance is hidden, and at a sharp angle, the afferent loop is elongated, and the papillary position is reversed. In these situations, the traditional side-viewing endoscope provides a limited visual field and makes afferent loop intubation challenging, thus increasing the risk for intestinal injuries. A forward-viewing endoscope may be a reasonable alternative in these circumstances, where afferent loop intubation would be easier, but papillary cannulation would be more challenging. The reversed papillary position makes it difficult for both side-viewing and forward-viewing endoscopes. The double-balloon enteroscopy technique uses two balloons to advance the forward-viewing endoscope through the intestine by alternating inflating and deflating balloons.
Document 12 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): highly sensitive, localizing 77–100% of insulinomas, which occur almost exclusively within the pancreas. Endoscopic ultrasound is less sensitive for extrapancreatic tumors. It is increasingly used in patients with MEN 1, and to a lesser extent VHL, to detect small pNETs not seen with other modalities or for serial pNET assessments to determine size changes or rapid growth in patients in whom surgery is deferred. EUS with cytologic evaluation also is used frequently to distinguish an NF-pNET from a pancreatic adenocarcinoma or another nonendocrine pancreatic tumor. Not infrequently patients present with liver metastases due to an NET and the primary site is unclear. Occult small intestinal NETs (carcinoids) are increasingly detected by double-balloon enteroscopy or capsule endoscopy.
Document 13 (Title: Meckel Diverticulum -- Evaluation): An angiogram is only indicated when results of a barium or nuclear scan are negative. With conventional contrast arteriography, a Meckel diverticulum is characterized by the finding of an anomalous superior mesenteric artery branch feeding the diverticulum. A bleeding Meckel diverticulum diagnosis can be established by Meckel scan or mesenteric arteriography, double-balloon enteroscopy, and capsule endoscopy. However, if diagnostic testing is inconclusive, or the patient is hemodynamically unstable, either laparotomy or laparoscopy is indicated to determine whether a Meckel's diverticulum is the source of bleeding. [15] [16] [17]
Document 14 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): Treitz into the proximal jejunum. This procedure can allow for visualization of approximately 60 cm of the proximal jejunum. Diagnostic yield in patients with obscure GI bleeding ranges from 3% to 65%. In addition to diagnosis, push enteroscopy allows for cauterization of bleed-ing sites.In Sonde enteroscopy, a long, thin fiberoptic instrument is propelled through the intestine by peristalsis following infla-tion of a balloon at the instrument’s tip. Visualization is done during instrument withdrawal; approximately 50% to 75% of the small intestinal mucosa can be examined. However, this instrument lacks biopsy or therapeutic capability. Further, it lacks tip deflection capability, limiting complete mucosal visu-alization, and has therefore been abandoned in favor of capsule endoscopy.Wireless capsule enteroscopy is an excellent tool in the patient who is hemodynamically stable but continues to bleed. This technique has reported success rates as high as 90% in identifying a small
Document 15 (Title: Complex Coronary Artery Lesions -- Treatment / Management): Bifurcation lesions - Many studies have shown the superiority of DES over BMS in bifurcating lesions. [37] Most trials have shown no advantage of using 2 stents versus 1 stent in these lesions. [38] Namely, the Nordic IV and European Bifurcation Club 2 trials revealed no difference in major adverse cardiac events between provisional and 2-stent strategies. [39] Despite these results showing the efficacy of a provisional side branch stenting strategy, various advanced techniques are still used when approaching such lesions. These advanced approaches include crush, T-stenting, and kissing balloon angioplasty. There are promising data regarding using the crush and double kissing (DK) techniques if double stenting is desired. [40] The classic crush technique involves wiring and pre-dilating both vessels, followed by deployment of the side branch stent, removal of the side branch balloon and wire, followed by deployment of the main branch stent. This deployment of the main branch stent “crushes” part of the side branch stent. There are also variations of this technique. Such variations include the classic crush, the mini-crush, simultaneous kissing stents (SKS), and the double kissing crush (DK crush). [41] The DK-Crush II trial revealed less target revascularization in the double kissing crush technique at 12 months versus provisional stenting. [42] The DKCRUSH-V trial cited the superiority of a DK crush 2-stent technique over provisional stenting for those with distal left main bifurcation lesions. [43] Another commonly used technique that has shown promising results is the T-stenting technique. This technique is useful for bifurcations with an angle close to 90 degrees. The steps involved include wiring and dilating both vessels simultaneously, stenting the main branch, followed by maintaining the wire and stenting the side branch. The final step in this technique is kissing balloon dilatation. The kissing balloon technique involves using 2 balloons in the side branch and main branches for luminal opening. [44]
