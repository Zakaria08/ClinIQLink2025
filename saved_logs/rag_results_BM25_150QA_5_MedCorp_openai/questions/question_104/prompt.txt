Document 1 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): 982 Listeria monocytogenes Infections Elizabeth L. Hohmann, Daniel A. Portnoy Listeria monocytogenes is a food-borne pathogen that can cause serious infections, particularly in pregnant women and immunocompromised 176 individuals. A ubiquitous saprophytic environmental bacterium, L. monocytogenes is also a facultative intracellular pathogen with a broad host range. Humans are probably accidental hosts for this microorganism. L. monocytogenes is of interest not only to clinicians but also to basic scientists as a model intracellular pathogen that is used to study basic mechanisms of microbial pathogenesis and host immunity. L. monocytogenes is a facultatively anaerobic, nonsporulating, gram-positive rod that grows over a broad temperature range, including refrigeration temperatures. This organism is motile during growth at low temperatures but much less so at 37°C. The vast majority of cases of human listerial disease can be traced to serotypes 1/2a, 1/2b, and 4.
Document 2 (Title: Growth of Listeria monocytogenes Scott A, serotype 4 and competitive spoilage organisms in raw chicken packaged under modified atmospheres and in air.): The development of Listeria monocytogenes Scott A, serotype 4 and aerobic plate counts on minced raw chicken were determined independently at 4, 10 and 27 degrees C. Samples were packaged in flexible film under two modified atmospheres (one containing oxygen and one containing no oxygen) or air. The anaerobic modified atmosphere (75:25, CO2:N2) resulted in the failure of both the aerobic plate counts and L. monocytogenes to grow at all temperatures. Both the L. monocytogenes and aerobic plate counts grew in air at all temperatures. The aerobic modified atmosphere (72.5:22.5:5, CO2:N2:O2), which more closely duplicates commercial practice, inhibited the increase in aerobic plate counts by more than 4 log10 cfu/g compared to air at 4 degrees C. However, the L. monocytogenes was not affected by this atmosphere and increased in numbers by nearly 6 log10 cfu/g at 4 degrees C in 21 days. Regression analysis of the log10 growth and 95% confidence intervals showed that the differences between aerobic plate counts and L. monocytogenes in modified atmosphere were large. The ability of L. monocytogenes to grow in the aerobic modified atmosphere was not affected by level of the L. monocytogenes inoculum nor by the initial level of aerobic plate counts. These data show that modified atmosphere packaging of raw chicken (and probably other meats) can substantially inhibit the aerobic spoilage flora while allowing pathogenic L. monocytogenes to increase.
Document 3 (Title: Listeria Monocytogenes -- Etiology): Listeria commonly causes meningitis in the young (neonates), elderly, and immunocompromised patient population. Healthy individuals infected with L. monocytogenes typically have a self-limiting gastrointestinal infection with fever and diarrhea. The Listeria family consists of 10 different species with L. monocytogenes found most consistently in humans. L. monocytogenes has 13 different serotypes based on a variety of flagellar and surface antigens.  However, there are only three serotypes (1/2a, 1/2b, 4a) that inflict disease in humans. [3] In general, the infectious dose of L. monocytogenes is large, meaning one must ingest a large number to cause clinical infection, but as growth and division can continue at refrigerator temperatures, these levels can be reached despite typical food storage precautions. Host immune response also affects the infectious dose. Utilization of proton pump inhibitors or other stomach acid suppression modalities makes it easier for L. monocytogenes to pass through the stomach and invade enterocytes.
Document 4 (Title: Listeria monocytogenes): The Anton test is used in the identification of L. monocytogenes; instillation of a culture into the conjunctival sac of a rabbit or guinea pig causes severe keratoconjunctivitis within 24 hours. Listeria species grow on media such as Mueller-Hinton agar. Identification is enhanced if the primary cultures are done on agar containing sheep blood, because the characteristic small zone of hemolysis can be observed around and under colonies. Isolation can be enhanced if the tissue is kept at 4 °C for some days before inoculation into bacteriologic media. The organism is a facultative anaerobe and is catalase-positive and motile. Listeria produces acid, but not gas, when fermenting a variety of carbohydrates. The motility at room temperature and hemolysin production are primary findings that help differentiate Listeria from Corynebacterium.
Document 5 (Title: Listeria monocytogenes): Routes of infection Listeria monocytogenes has been associated with such foods as raw milk, pasteurized fluid milk, cheeses (particularly soft-ripened varieties), hard-boiled eggs, ice cream, raw vegetables, fermented raw-meat sausages, raw and cooked poultry, raw meats (of all types), and raw and smoked fish. Most bacteria can survive near freezing temperatures, but cannot absorb nutrients, grow or replicate; however, L. monocytogenes has the ability to grow at temperatures as low as 0 °C which permits exponential multiplication in refrigerated foods. At refrigeration temperature, such as 4 °C, the amount of ferric iron can affect the growth of L. monocytogenes. Infectious cycle
