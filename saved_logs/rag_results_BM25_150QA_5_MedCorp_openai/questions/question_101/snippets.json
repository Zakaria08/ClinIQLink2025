Overprescribing may contribute to increasing future antibiotic resistance to the drug, so a pharmacy consult is necessary for the prescriber to ensure directed therapy. The documentation already exists regarding increased resistance to metronidazole in the treatment of C. difficile infections. Also, prescribers, nurses, and pharmacists should routinely educate patients to abstain from alcoholic beverages while taking metronidazole, which will help lead to fewer disulfiram reaction symptoms; nursing will play a role in this monitoring and for other potential adverse effects. The patient should also be informed by the health care provider of the possible change in urine color while on this medicine. The team of health professionals, including physicians, physician assistants, nurses, and pharmacists, must work together to provide the best care for these patients when using metronidazole in any formulation.

        "content": "Adverse effects include nausea, diarrhea, stomatitis, and peripheral neuropathy with prolonged use. Metronidazole has a disulfiram-like effect, and patients should be instructed to avoid alcohol. Although teratogenic in some animals, metronidazole has not been associated with this effect in humans. Other properties of metronidazole are discussed in Chapter 52. A structurally similar agent, tinidazole, is a once-daily drug approved for treatment of trichomonas infection, giardiasis, amebiasis, and bacterial vaginosis. It also is active against anaerobic bacteria, but is not approved in the USA for treatment of anaerobic infections.",

        "title": "Guidelines for clinical care: anti-infective agents for intra-abdominal infection. A Surgical Infection Society policy statement.",
        "content": "Several antibiotics have been marketed for therapeutic use in intra-abdominal infection. Often, these agents do not provide a sufficient spectrum activity against both facultative and obligate anaerobic gram-negative organisms, or have certain toxic effects that would not otherwise support their use. Guidelines have been developed for selection of antibiotic therapy for intra-abdominal infections and are presented as a statement of the Surgical Infection Society endorsed by the Executive Council. These guidelines are restricted to infections derived from the gastrointestinal tract and deal with those microorganisms commonly seen in such infections. The recommendations are based on in vitro activity against enteric bacteria, experience in animal models, and documented efficacy in clinical trials. Other concerns regarding pharmacokinetics, mechanisms of action, microbial resistance, and safety were also used in the formation of these guidelines. For community-acquired infections of mild to moderate severity, single-agent therapy with cefoxitin, cefotetan, or cefmetazole or ticarcillin-clavulanic acid is recommended. For more severe infections, single-agent therapy with carbapenems (imipenem/cilastatin) or combination therapy with either a third-generation cephalosporin, a monobactam (aztreonam), or an aminoglycoside plus clindamycin or metronidazole is recommended. Regimens with little or no activity against facultative gram-negative rods or anaerobic gram-negative rods are not considered acceptable.",

        "content": "Nitroimidazole antibiotics From the chemistry perspective, nitroimidazole antibiotics can be classified according to the location of the nitro functional group. Structures with names 4- and 5-nitroimidazole are equivalent from the perspective of drugs since these tautomers readily interconvert. Drugs of the 5-nitro variety include metronidazole, tinidazole, nimorazole, dimetridazole, pretomanid, ornidazole, megazol, and azanidazole. Drugs based on 2-nitromidazoles include benznidazole. Nitroimidazole antibiotics have been used to combat anaerobic bacterial and parasitic infections. Perhaps the most common example is metronidazole. Other heterocycles such as nitrothiazoles (thiazole) are also used for this purpose. Nitroheterocycles may be reductively activated in hypoxic cells, and then undergo redox recycling or decompose to toxic products. References Disulfiram-like drugs",

        "content": "Metronidazole, a drug effective against certain protozoal and anaerobic infections, was given female patients with Trichomoniasis urogenitalis. Group I received twice daily 250 mg of metronidazole (supplied as 250 mg tablets Vagimid). Group II received in a single dose 1.0 g (4 tablets); and group III, 2.0 g (8 tablets). Serum and urine metronidazole levels were measured polarographically. Kinetic parameters were determined from the measured values of the concentration time curve by a computing program. An exact control of the therapeutic result was carried out. In all patients peak serum levels occurred within 1-3 hr and averaged 5.1 +/- 1.7 microgram/ml after 250 mg doses, 19.6 +/- 3.8 microgram/ml after 1.0 g doses and 40.6 +/- 9.3 microgram/ml after 2.0 g doses. About 35% of the administered dose was recovered in the urine in 12 hr and about 50% in 24 hr. Metronidazole shows protein binding of 10-20% equally in vivo and in vitro. Minimum trichomonacidic concentrations of nearly 1 microgram/ml were still present 12 hr after oral application of 250 mg metronidazole, and 24 hr to 36 hr, respectively after 1.0 g and 2.0 g daily doses. The cure rate was 100%. No serious side effects ocurred in any of the patients.",
