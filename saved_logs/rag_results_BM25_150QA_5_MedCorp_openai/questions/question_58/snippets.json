        "content": "Carotid IMT has been used in many epidemiological and clinical studies and these have shown associations with several risk factors, including type 2 diabetes, familial hypercholesterolemia, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), triglycerides, rheumatoid arthritis, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and air pollution. Since the 1990s, some clinical trials of lifestyle and pharmaceutical interventions have also used carotid artery IMT as a surrogate endpoint for evaluating the regression and/or progression of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; however the appropriateness of carotid IMT in this context is uncertain. Although carotid intima-media thickness is strongly associated with atherosclerosis, thickening of the intima-media may not always be due to atherosclerosis. Intima-medial thickening is a complex process, depending on a variety of factors, including blood pressure, local hemodynamics, shear stress and circumferential tensile stress.

        "content": "Missense and nonsense mutations in the apoA-I gene are present in some patients with low plasma levels of HDL-C (usually 15\u201330 mg/ dL), but are a rare cause of low plasma HDL-C levels. Most individuals with low plasma HDL-C levels due to missense mutations in apoA-I do not appear to have premature CHD. Patients who are heterozygous for an Arg173Cys substitution in apoA-I (so-called apoA-IMilano) have very low plasma levels of HDL-C due to impaired LCAT activation and accelerated clearance of the HDL particles containing the abnormal apoA-I. Despite having very low plasma levels of HDL-C, these individuals do not have an increased risk of premature CHD. A few selected missense mutations in apoA-I and apoA-II promote the formation of amyloid fibrils, which can cause systemic amyloidosis.",

        "title": "IDL, VLDL, chylomicrons and atherosclerosis.",
        "content": "In humans with the lipoprotein lipase deficiency disorder large amounts of chylomicrons and large very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) accumulate in plasma. In spite of this, atherosclerosis does not seem to develop at an accelerated rate, suggesting that these lipoproteins do not promote atherogenesis. In humans with dysbetalipoproteinemia remnant lipoproteins (intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL) plus beta-VLDL) accumulate in plasma and these particles may therefore be the factor causing accelerated atherosclerosis in this disorder. Epidemiological studies in humans suggest that IDL or remnant lipoproteins are predictors of the severity or progression of atherosclerosis. Similar studies in the St. Thomas' Hospital rabbit strain, an animal model with genetically elevated plasma levels of VLDL, IDL and low-density lipoprotein (LDL), showed that IDL or remnant lipoproteins were better predictors of the extent of atherosclerosis than were LDL or VLDL. Studies of lipoprotein/arterial wall interactions have demonstrated that the larger the lipoprotein particle, the lower the influx into intima. Very large VLDL and chylomicrons do not seem to enter intima. Although high-density lipoprotein (HDL) enters intima faster than other lipoproteins, the small HDL particles seem to penetrate the entire arterial wall and leave via lymphatics and vasa vasorum in the outer media and adventitia. In contrast, LDL, and possibly also IDL and smaller VLDL, may only leave the intima via the lumen of the artery. In conclusion, a substantial body of evidence suggests that remnant lipoproteins (IDL and smaller VLDL) share with LDL the potential for promoting atherosclerosis, whereas very large VLDL and chylomicrons do not seem to have this effect.",

        "title": "Ultrasound measurement of wall thickness in the carotid artery: fundamental principles and description of a computerized analysing system.",
        "content": "A B-mode [two-dimensional (2D)] image from the carotid artery may be described as containing seven echo zones. The aim of the present work is to discuss how lumen diameter and wall thickness can be measured from these zones, and to review some of the basic principles of ultrasound physics and imaging. Simple experiments were performed to identify the echoes defining intima-lumen interfaces. The results showed that: (1) The intima-media thickness of the near wall cannot be measured in a valid way. (2) The lumen diameter of a blood vessel is defined by the distance from the leading edge of the intima-lumen interface of the near wall (echo zone 3) to the leading edge of the lumen-intima interface of the fall wall (echo zone 5). (3) Previously published studies have validated the intima-media complex of the far wall as the distance from the leading edge of the lumen-intima interface of the far wall to the leading edge of the media-adventitia interface of the far wall (echo zone 7). We suggest that if measurements on the near wall are performed, measurements from the far wall should also be presented separately, and if lumen diameter is measured, that this measurement is carried out according to the leading edge principle. We describe a computerized analysing system for the measurement of wall thickness and plaque area on the carotid and femoral arteries. The system is based on a low-cost PC and a frame grabber board and calculates minimum, maximum and mean values of lumen diameter and wall thickness from a section of the artery.",
