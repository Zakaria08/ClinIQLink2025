Document 1 (Title: Safe to Sleep): In 1992, the first National Infant Sleep Position (NISP) Household Survey was conducted to determine the usual position in which U.S. mothers placed their babies to sleep: lateral (side), prone (stomach), supine (back), other, or no usual position. According to the 1992 NISP survey, 13.0% of U.S. infants were positioned in the supine position for sleep. According to the 2006 NISP survey 75.7% of infants were positioned in the supine position to sleep. According the CDC, the four tips for parents and caregivers to help a baby sleep safety are as follows: 1.)Place your baby on his or her back for all sleep times-naps and at night. 2.)Use a firm sleep surface, such as a mattress in a safety-approved crib. 3.) Keep soft bedding such as blankets, pillows, bumper pads, and soft toys out of baby’s sleep area. 4.) have baby share your room, not your bed.

Document 2 (Title: Sudden Infant Death Syndrome -- Deterrence and Patient Education): Medical professionals must be aware of current recommendations for safe sleeping practices and SIDS prevention: do not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs during pregnancy, place the infant on the back to sleep, allow the infant to sleep in his or her own crib in the same room as caregivers, and use a firm and flat surface in a safety-approved crib. Keep soft bedding or objects such as blankets, pillows, bumper pads, or toys out of the sleeping environment. Avoid covering the infant's head and avoid overheating. Avoid second-hand smoke. Smokers should change clothes and wash their hair before coming in contact with the infant. Infants and caregivers benefit from learning to use a pacifier at bedtime - Do Not Prop bottles in the baby's mouth! Breastfeeding and immunizations are beneficial.
Document 3 (Title: Can the fall in Avon's sudden infant death rate be explained by changes in sleeping position?): To examine the impact of changing practice with regard to infant sleeping position on mortality from the sudden infant death syndrome. A population based study of all infants dying suddenly and unexpectedly during February 1990 to July 1991, and two groups of controls; one comprising every 125th baby born to Avon residents and the other comprising pairs of infants matched to each index case for age, neighbourhood, and date of study. Information about sleeping position was collected at home visits soon after the index baby's death or, for the population based controls, on several occasions in the first six months of life. The design was comparable to that of an earlier study of the same population. County of Avon. 35 infants who died suddenly and unexpectedly (32 of the sudden infant death syndrome), 70 matched controls, and 152 population based controls. The prevalence of prone sleeping in the matched controls was much lower than that found in an earlier study in Avon (28% (18/64) 1990-1 v 58% (76/131) 1987-9; p less than 0.001) and was comparable with the prevalence in population based controls (29%). This would be expected to lead to a reduction in the incidence of the sudden infant death syndrome to 2.0/1000 live births (95% confidence interval 1.8/1000 to 2.5/1000). The actual mortality fell from 3.5/1000 in 1987-9 to 1.7/1000. The fall in mortality can be almost entirely accounted for by the reduction in prone sleeping, suggesting a causal relation exists between them. Side and supine positions confer protection but the side position is unstable and the infant may roll prone. We therefore recommend supine as the safest sleeping position for babies.
Document 4 (Title: Pediatrics_Nelson): A variety of unproven mechanisms have been proposed to explain SIDS. SIDS is associated with prone position during sleep, especially on soft bedding. The widely advocated supine sleeping position explains, in part, the decreased incidence of SIDS during the past two decades. Current theories for a predisposition to SIDS include cellular brainstem abnormalities and maturational delay related to neural or cardiorespiratory control. A portion of SIDS deaths may be due to prolongation of the Q-T interval, abnormal CNS control of respiration, and CO2 rebreathing from sleeping face down (especially in softbedding). See Table 134-1 for the differential diagnosis of SIDS. There has been a significant decline in SIDS with the backto-sleep program and avoiding soft bedding. Thus, all parents should be instructed to place their infants in the supine position unless there are medical contraindications. All soft Fulminant infection*,† Infant botulism*
Document 5 (Title: Pathology_Robbins): Among the potential environmental causes, prone sleeping position, sleeping on soft surfaces, and thermal stress are possibly the most important modifiable risk factors for SIDS. Many studies have clearly shown increased risk for SIDS in infants who sleep in a prone position, prompting the American Academy of Pediatrics to recommend placing healthy infants on their backs when laying them down to sleep. This “Back to Sleep” campaign has resulted in substantial decreases in SIDS-related deaths since its inception in 1994. The prone position increases the infant’s vulnerability to one or more recognized noxious stimuli (hypoxia, hypercarbia, and thermal stress) during sleep. In addition, the prone position also is associated with decreased arousal responsiveness compared with the supine position.

Answer the following multiple-choice question.

A. Placing the infant in a supine position on a firm mattress while sleeping
B. Keeping the infant covered and maintaining a high room temperature
C. Application of a device to maintain the sleeping position
D. Avoiding pacifier use during sleep
