Document 1 (Title: Intravenous prophylhexedrine (Benzedrex®) abuse and sudden death.): Propylhexedrine was implicated in 15 deaths investigated by the Dallas County Medical Examiner since 1973. Twelve of the deaths were attributable to intravenous abuse of the contents of the Benzedrex® inhaler. Each death could be defined as sudden. Pulmonary edema, foreign body granulomas, fibrosis and evidence of pulmonary hypertension were frequent postmortem findings. Right ventricular hypertrophy was present in nine of the 12 subjects who died of intravenous propylhexedrine abuse. Two homicides and one suicide were propylhexedrine-related. Intravenous propylhexedrine abuse should be considered in the differential diagnosis of right ventricular hypertrophy and/or pulmonary hypertension, and it should be suspected in cases of sudden death involving young adults displaying evidence of intravenous drug abuse.
Document 2 (Title: Inappropriate Medication in the Geriatric Population -- Introduction): Potentially inappropriate medications (PIM) can be defined as drugs that pose an increased risk of causing adverse events. [1] The American Geriatrics Society Beers Criteria® is a set of recommendations for avoiding PIMs in the geriatric population. [2] Initially published in 1991, the AGS Beers Criteria® has been periodically updated to provide more accurate and practical guidelines for healthcare providers. [3] [4] [1] The AGS Beers Criteria® is consistently revised by an interprofessional team utilizing an evidence-based approach. [3] [5] The latest version of the AGS Beers Criteria® was written in 2019 to assist practicing clinicians in outpatient, acute, and institutional settings. It includes medications evaluated in 5 main categories: drugs to avoid, drugs to use with caution, drug-drug interactions, medications to avoid in particular clinical situations, and dosage according to kidney function. [3] The AGS Beers Criteria® is a guideline for practitioners to improve prescriptions, outcomes, and quality of care. Although this list is a comprehensive guide for clinicians, nurses, pharmacists, patients, and their families, it complements clinical judgment as each scenario is unique. [3] This topic presents the main issues of concern, clinical significance, and interprofessional aspects of the AGS Beers Criteria®.

Document 4 (Title: MasterFormat): Related Organizational Formats SectionFormat® is a standard for organizing information within each Section. Like MasterFormat®, SectionFormat® is a joint publication of the Construction Specifications Institute (CSI) and Construction Specifications Canada (CSC). It is used by MasterSpec, SpecText, NMS, and SpecsIntact systems. It is also common among manufacture specifications and design firm office masters. A Section is divided into three Parts; "Part 1 - General," "Part 2 - Products," and "Part 3 - Execution." Each Part is further organized into a system of Articles and Paragraphs. MasterFormat®'s Division 01 is extensively coordinated with SectionFormat®'s Part 1 to reduce duplication of requirements common to multiple sections.
Document 5 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): FIGURE 297e-17 Three-dimensional echocardiographic recon-struction of the secundum ASD. The ASD is round and has an acceptable margin of tissue to seat a septal occluder device. CHAPTER 297e Atlas of Percutaneous Revascularization FIGURE 297e-18 ASD percutaneous closure devices. The Amplatzer® septal occluder (left) and the HELEX® septal occluder (right) are among the devices used for percutaneous closure of ASDs. The Amplatzer® septal occluder is a plug between two disks that are positioned on each side of the ASD to obstruct blood flow. The HELEX® Septal Occluder is positioned on each side of the ASD to allow circular rings covered with rapidly stretching polytetrafluoroethylene device to limit blood flow. The delivery catheters are detached and the devices are left in place. (Illustration by Justin E. Tribuna.)
