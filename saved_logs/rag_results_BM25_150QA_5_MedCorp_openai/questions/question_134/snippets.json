        "content": "Decreased albumin levels may be an incidental finding on protein electrophoresis; however, protein electrophoresis provides a semi-quantitative albumin value. The main value of protein electrophoresis in a patient with low serum albumin is with the differential diagnosis of hypoalbuminemia. In the presence of acute inflammation, hypoalbuminemia will be present with an increase in alpha-1 and 2 globulins and normal gamma globulins. In chronic inflammation, the protein electrophoresis pattern will show hypoalbuminemia with a polyclonal increase in gamma globulins.",

        "content": "acidosis. An increase in the AG is most often due to an increase in unmeasured anions and, less commonly, is due to a decrease in unmeasured cations (calcium, magnesium, potassium). In addition, the AG may increase with an increase in anionic albumin, because of either increased albumin concentration or alkalosis, which alters albumin charge. A decrease in the AG can be due to (1) an increase in unmeasured cations; (2) the addition to the blood of abnormal cations, such as lithium (lithium intoxication) or cationic immunoglobulins (plasma cell dyscrasias); (3) a reduction in the major plasma anion albumin concentration (nephrotic syndrome); (4) a decrease in the effective anionic charge on albumin by acidosis; or (5) hyperviscosity and severe hyperlipidemia, which can lead to an underestimation of sodium and chloride concentrations. A fall in serum albumin by 1 g/dL from the normal value (4.5 g/dL) decreases the AG by 2.5 meq/L. Know the common causes of a high-AG acidosis (Table",

        "title": "A special, supplemented 'vegan' diet for nephrotic patients.",
        "content": "High dietary protein intake, in the past recommended for nephrotic syndrome, does not improve hypoproteinemia and may accelerate progressive renal damage. In contrast, low-protein diets reduce proteinuria and preserve renal function in experimental renal models of nephrotic syndrome. In this study, 20 steroid-resistant, nephrotic patients were treated with a pure vegetarian, low-protein diet, supplemented with essential amino acids and ketoanalogues (supplemented vegan diet, SVD) for 4.6 +/- 3.1 months. Before the study, these patients followed an unrestricted protein, low-sodium diet (LSD). Proteinuria, daily urea nitrogen excretion and creatinine clearance decreased significantly on SVD. A similar lowering effect of SVD was observed on serum total cholesterol. Seven of the 20 patients changed from LSD to SVD and vice-versa on 3 occasions, and in all cases, we found an increase of proteinuria during the LSD period. Serum albumin, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides and anthropometric measurements did not change on SVD. Our data suggest that SVD exerts a favorable effect on proteinuria and hypercholesterolemia in nephrotic patients, without inducing clinical or laboratory signs of malnutrition.",

        "content": "Total serum thyroxine (T4), free thyroxine index (FTI), thyroxine binding globulin (TBG) binding capacity, serum albumin, alpha-globulins and urinary protein excretion were measured in 50 patients with chronic renal failure, but without nephrotic syndrome. 25 patients were undergoing chronic hemodialysis. T4 was within the normal range in most patients. There was a tendency to lower T4 values as compared to an age and sex-matched control group, but this did not reach statistical significance. TBG was normal in most patients. 4 patients showed elevated TBG concomitant with elevation of other alpha-globulins. Serum albumin was significantly decreased. No correlation existed between daily protein excretion and TBG or alpha-globulins, but the correlation between serum albumin and proteinuria was highly significant. T4 and proteinuria correlated with borderline significance. A highly significant correlation between T4 and TBG-albumin values was found. No correlation existed between FTI and TBG-albumin levels. The data suggest that T4 and TBG are normal in most patients with renal failure, even in the presence of significant proteinuria. Low T4 values, when found in renal insufficiency, may be secondary to low serum albumin and possibly prealbumin.",
