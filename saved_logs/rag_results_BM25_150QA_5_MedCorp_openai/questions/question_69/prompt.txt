Document 1 (Title: High density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration as a predictor of coronary heart disease in West Indian men.): The aim of the study was to determine whether the inverse association between high density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration and risk of coronary heart disease described in people of European stock was also present in other racial groups. The study was a prospective population survey. Cardiovascular risk factors were examined, including fasting serum lipid estimation (obtained at recruitment). This was a community based study within a defined survey area in Trinidad. All men aged between 35 and 69 years within the survey area were identified and followed between 1977 and 1986. Analysis was confined to those of African, Asian Indian, and mixed descent who were free of coronary heart disease at entry (n = 960, 69% of age eligible men in the survey population). 64 men developed coronary heart disease during the study period. A strong inverse curvilinear relation was found between high density lipoprotein cholesterol and coronary heart disease incidence (p less than 0.005), independent of age or other relevant characteristics including low density lipoprotein cholesterol. A low serum concentration of high density lipoprotein cholesterol is a risk factor for coronary heart disease in non-whites as well as in whites.
Document 2 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Humans are the only reservoir of T. b. gambiense, which occurs in widely distributed foci in tropical rain forests of Central and West Africa. Gambiense trypanosomiasis is primarily a problem in rural populations; tourists rarely become infected. Trypanotolerant antelope species in savanna and woodland areas of Central and East Africa are the principal reservoir of T. b. rhodesiense. Cattle can also be infected with this and other trypanosome species but generally succumb to the infection. Because risk results from contact with tsetse flies that feed on wild animals, humans acquire T. b. rhodesiense infection only inciden-1397 tally, usually while visiting or working in areas where infected game and vectors are present. Roughly one or two imported cases of HAT acquired in East African parks are reported to the CDC each year.
Document 3 (Title: Western Equine Encephalitis -- Epidemiology): Most cases have occurred west of the Mississippi River, west of the Rocky Mountains, and in California. The annual incidence of reported infections is highly variable due to periods of inactivity punctuated by outbreaks. Warm weather and heavy rainfall tend to increase vector populations leading to epidemics. Transmission is most common in rural areas. The most significant outbreak occurred in 1941, with over 3000 confirmed human cases. Since 1964 there have been fewer than 700 confirmed cases in the United States. Cases are more commonly reported in males, about twice the rate as females, possibly due to an increased likelihood of outdoor occupations and activities. Transmission is most likely between April and September, with peaks in July and August. During epidemics, a large portion of the population seroconverts but infectivity rates vary with age. Infants are most commonly infected as they have the greatest likelihood of contracting the virus after a mosquito bite. Adults are more commonly targeted by the vector but have lower infectivity rates. However, when they are infected, older adults are more likely to develop more severe, neuroinvasive disease or to die. Infants and very young children are also more likely to develop neurologic manifestations of the disease and seizures. They are more likely than adults to develop permanent disability after infection. Reported infectivity rates are 1:1000 for adults, 1:58 for children aged 1-4, and 1:1 in infants. [6] [7] [8] [9]
Document 4 (Title: Heart rate): Other studies have shown that a high resting heart rate is associated with an increase in cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in the general population and in patients with chronic diseases. A faster resting heart rate is associated with shorter life expectancy and is considered a strong risk factor for heart disease and heart failure, independent of level of physical fitness. Specifically, a resting heart rate above 65 beats per minute has been shown to have a strong independent effect on premature mortality; every 10 beats per minute increase in resting heart rate has been shown to be associated with a 10–20% increase in risk of death. In one study, men with no evidence of heart disease and a resting heart rate of more than 90 beats per minute had a five times higher risk of sudden cardiac death. Similarly, another study found that men with resting heart rates of over 90 beats per minute had an almost two-fold increase in risk for cardiovascular disease mortality; in women it
Document 5 (Title: Heart rate): Correlation with cardiovascular mortality risk A number of investigations indicate that faster resting heart rate has emerged as a new risk factor for mortality in homeothermic mammals, particularly cardiovascular mortality in human beings. Faster heart rate may accompany increased production of inflammation molecules and increased production of reactive oxygen species in cardiovascular system, in addition to increased mechanical stress to the heart. There is a correlation between increased resting rate and cardiovascular risk. This is not seen to be "using an allotment of heart beats" but rather an increased risk to the system from the increased rate.
