Document 1 (Title: Inflammatory breast cancer): Treatment The standard treatment for newly diagnosed inflammatory breast cancer is to receive systemic therapy prior to surgery, followed by the radiation therapy. Achieving "no disease [pathological complete response (pCR)]" in the surgical samples gives the best prognosis. Surgery is modified radical mastectomy. Lumpectomy, segmentectomy, or skin sparing mastectomy are not recommended. Immediate reconstructive surgery is not recommended. Immediate,"upfront" surgery is contraindicated, as results are better using neoadjuvant chemotherapy first. Contralateral prophylactic mastectomy is not recommended because it can delay the other systemic adjuvant treatment or adjuvant radiation therapy. After surgery, all cases are recommended for radiation therapy unless it is contraindicated.
Document 2 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): candidates for immediate reconstruction because of advanced disease or comorbidities.Immediate reconstruction is defined as initiation of the breast reconstructive process at the time of the ablative sur-gery. Patients are considered candidates for immediate recon-struction who are in general good health and have stage I or stage II disease determined primarily by the size and location of the tumor. There are selected exceptions, such as when an extensive resection requires chest wall coverage. Breast recon-struction might be performed in these cases, but it is really incidental to achieving chest wall coverage. Disadvantages of immediate reconstruction include the potential delay of adju-vant therapy in the event of postoperative complications. Also, if there is uncertainty regarding the need to adjuvant radiation therapy, decision-making regarding immediate reconstruction is a challenge. Breast reconstructions by all techniques are adversely affected by radiation therapy, and many
Document 3 (Title: The impact of adjuvant radiotherapy and cytotoxic chemotherapy on the outcome of immediate breast reconstruction by tissue expansion after mastectomy for breast cancer.): In an attempt to evaluate the impact of radiation therapy and cytotoxic chemotherapy on the outcome of immediate breast reconstruction by tissue expansion after mastectomy a prospective study on 32 patients was performed. The radiation therapy significantly worsened the surgical outcome, because the irradiated patients more often had pectoral muscle stiffness making the expansion more painful and the reconstructed breast too small, hard and with insufficient ptosis to obtain a natural breast mould. These results indicate that this technique should be avoided in patients likely to receive postoperative adjuvant cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiation therapy, thus reducing the indication to a small group of patients undergoing mastectomy for widespread ductal carcinoma in situ.
Document 4 (Title: Postoperatively Adjustable Breast Implant -- Contraindications): Medical conditions that can compromise the skin envelope for the breast implant include scleroderma, history of radiation, and history of smoking. The previously irradiated breast can lead to implant infection and extrusion; therefore, for these patients, autologous tissue reconstruction is preferred. If a patient needs adjuvant radiation therapy after mastectomy, immediate implant-based reconstruction is advised against until radiation is completed. [1] For pre-pectoral (subcutaneous) implant placement, high body mass index, history of smoking, and pre-operative radiation are absolute contraindications due to the high risk of implant extrusion. [5]
Document 5 (Title: Breast Reconstruction Expander Implant -- Indications): Most patients are candidates for expanders and implants, and some patients will elect this option even if autologous tissue reconstruction is also possible. [3] The ideal candidate is a thin female undergoing bilateral mastectomy or a thin female undergoing unilateral mastectomy with little to no ptosis of the contralateral breast; the latter indication is to facilitate the final symmetry between the breasts, as a ptotic breast is extremely challenging to recreate with an implant. [4] Obese patients and patients with very large contralateral breasts may complicate the expander and implant results both in terms of final breast shape/definition and intraoperative placement. The expansion process may fail to obtain symmetry of the new breast pocket or satisfactorily define the new breast owing to thick subcutaneous fat deposits. The patient can often undergo the procedure immediately following the mastectomy but can also choose a delayed repair in a subsequent surgery if they are unsure if they desire reconstruction or if they wish to definitively know their need for any adjuvant radiation based on final pathologic results after mastectomy. The principal benefit of the immediate expansion is the avoidance of an additional general anesthetic. Additionally, it may be possible for the plastic surgeon and breast surgeon to collaborate on the best technique to retain as much native skin envelope as possible. However, it must be emphasized the reconstruction can in no way compromise the oncologic safety of the mastectomy. The surgeon's primary goal is the successful cure of the patient's breast cancer; reconstruction can always be re-addressed if surprises are encountered at the time of mastectomy. [5] [6] [7]
