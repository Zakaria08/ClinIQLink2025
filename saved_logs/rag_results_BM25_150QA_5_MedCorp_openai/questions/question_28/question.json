Over the past 2 months, he was suspended 3 times for bullying and aggressive behavior towards his peers and teachers. Once, his neighbor found him smoking cigarettes in his backyard. In the past, he consistently maintained an A grade average and had been a regular attendee of youth group events at their local church. The mother first noticed this change in behavior 3 months ago, around the time at which his father moved out after discovering his wife was having an affair. Which of the following defense mechanisms best describes the change in this patient's behavior?",
