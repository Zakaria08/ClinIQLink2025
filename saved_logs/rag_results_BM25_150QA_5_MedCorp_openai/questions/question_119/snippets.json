        "content": "A number of 2-N-aralkylidene, 2-N-aralkyl and 2-N-aralkyl-alpha-sulphoderivatives of 2-amino-4-p-chlorophenylthiazole-5-acetic acid (I, R = H) and its methyl ester (I, R = CH3) were synthesized. As a result of condensation of methyl ester I with various aromatic aldehydes in boiling benzene solution, the Schiff-bases (anils) II--VIII were obtained. After reduction with NaBH4 compounds II--VIII were transformed into adequate amino esters IX--XV. Esters IX--XV heated with diluted aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide underwent selective hydrolysis giving the respective amino acids XVI--XXII. Some of Schiff bases (II, III, V, VII, VIII) reacted with aqueous alcoholic solution of sodium bisulphite after its several (XXIII--XXVII). alpha-sulphoderivatives had been obtained. Several tests were performed in order to detect the anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive activity of the compounds. The pharmacological analysis allowed us to draw conclusions concerning the relationship between chemical structure and biological activity in this group of compounds. The most efficacious immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory activity exhibited 2-aralkyl-alpha-sulphoderivatives.",

        "content": "A simple and selective method is presented for the multiple residue determination of eight sulphonamides in consumers' milk. The drugs are sulphisomidine (ID), sulphadiazine (DZ), sulphamerazine, sulphadimidine, sulphamonomethoxine, sulphamethoxazole, sulphadimethoxine and sulphaquinoxaline (SQ). The milk sample was deproteinized with the same volume of 2 M hydrochloric acid and filtered. A 1-ml volume of the filtrate was mixed with 1 ml each of 1.25 M sodium acetate solution and a buffer (pH 3.0) for derivatization with 0.6 ml of 0.02% fluorescamine solution in acetone. A high-performance liquid chromatographic analysis was carried out on a C18 column with a mobile phase of acetonitrile-2% acetic acid (3:5) at 55 degrees C using a fluorescence detector at an excitation wavelength of 405 nm and an emission wavelength of 495 nm. Average recoveries at fortification levels of 2, 5 and 10 ng/ml were 114%, 109% and 106%, respectively. Relative standard deviations were 1-4% at 10 ng/ml for ID, 5 ng/ml for DZ and SQ and 2.5 ng/ml for the other five sulphonamides. The method was applied to 25 milk samples and all appeared to be free from the drugs.",
