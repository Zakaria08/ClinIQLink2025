Based on the following information:

Document 1 (Title: Prostate Cancer -- Medical Oncology -- Aggressive Prostate Cancer): Aggressive disease in prostate cancer is typically defined as either locally advanced, a higher Gleason score (Gleason 4+4=8 or higher), or a rapid PSA doubling time of 10 months or less. Treatment for aggressive prostate cancers may involve radical prostatectomy, radiation therapy, HIFU, cryosurgery, hormonal therapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, radiopharmaceuticals, or some combination of these. Early use of combinatorial therapies is helpful in many patients presenting with aggressive or advanced, localized disease. [26] [296] [321]
Document 2 (Title: Prostate Cancer -- Prognosis -- Do We Absolutely, Positively Need to Have a Positive Prostate Tissue Biopsy to Treat Prostate Cancer?): With the use of MRI imaging, genomic analysis, validated prostatic nomograms, and all of the other pre-biopsy predictive tests, it is feasible to consider initiating some degree of prostate cancer treatment in selected cases even without absolute histological confirmation of malignancy if the likelihood of cancer is sufficiently high. Such cases are likely to be infrequent, and patients must be thoroughly informed about the standard of care and the potential risks and benefits of treatment without absolute confirmation of an aggressive prostatic malignancy. [473]
Document 3 (Title: Prostate Cancer -- Evaluation -- Genomic (Somatic) Tumor Biomarkers (Post-Biopsy)): Prolaris test: This test was the first commercially available genomic tumor marker to evaluate prostate cancer aggressiveness. [217] The Prolaris test analyzes 46 genes and specifically measures the RNA expression of 31 genes involved in cell cycle progression. The test is designed to indicate the risk of biochemical recurrence and prostate cancer-specific mortality over the next 10 years when combined with the PSA level, clinical stage, percentage of positive biopsy cores, biopsy grade group, and AUA risk group. [212] In a large prospective registry, the Prolaris test changed the initial treatment selection in 47.8% of 1600 participants, with 75% opting for a less aggressive therapy and 25% choosing a more definitive treatment option. [218] The test is most useful in facilitating decision-making for individuals with localized disease and low- or intermediate-risk cancers (both favorable and unfavorable) who are considering active surveillance versus definitive treatment. Prolaris can identify cancer-specific mortality for men on active surveillance and with biochemical recurrence for those who have had radiation therapy or undergone TURP surgery. [144] [212] Similar to the Decipher test, the Prolaris test is also useful in patients after radical prostatectomy surgery and in high-risk cases for prognostic purposes. [212]
