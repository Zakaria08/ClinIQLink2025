Based on the following information:

Document 1 (Title: REM Rebound Effect -- Treatment / Management): Respiratory, cardiac, gastrointestinal, endocrine, psychiatric, and neurological disorders that affect sleep and potentially cause REM rebound should be diagnosed and treated. Medications or substances that might contribute to REM rebound should be adjusted as necessary to minimize their impact on REM sleep.
Document 2 (Title: Sleep and Neurodegenerative Disorders -- Evaluation -- Insomnia): In patients with Parkinson disease, a detailed evaluation is warranted to identify a potential contributor to insomnia. Patients should be asked about the presence of any motor symptoms at night (cramps, stiffness, or impaired turning in bed), autonomic symptoms such as nocturia, presence of concomitant mood disorder, sleep apnea, or RLS. A history of recent dose adjustments in medications for Parkinson disease should also be obtained. If the patient has difficulty providing a history, sleep logs, diaries, and sleep trackers may be helpful. Self-reported screening tools could be used through validated questionnaires such as the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and sleep problems questionnaire. [49] [50] In patients with Parkinson disease-associated insomnia, Parkinson disease-specific screening questionnaires such as Parkinson Disease Sleep Scale-2 (PDSS-2) or Scales for Outcomes in Parkinson disease-SLEEP can be used. [51] Evaluation tools such as the STOP-Bang score help determine the probability of OSA. [52]
Document 3 (Title: Sleep and Neurodegenerative Disorders -- Epidemiology): The coexistence of SDB and Parkinson disease has been reported in the literature in variable frequency (prevalence between 27% and 73%). [31] [32] Even though several studies have indicated that many patients with Parkinson disease experience SDB, the reported prevalence varies due to various factors, such as different definitions of respiratory events, severity thresholds of the disease, or diagnostic methods employed. [33] [34] This variability in reported prevalence is explained by heterogeneity in sample size, disease severity, and diagnostic definition and testing modality. For example, using standard diagnostic polysomnography (PSG) in a retrospective series of 49 patients with Parkinson disease, at least 21 patients (43%) had OSA diagnosed (apnea/hypopnea index [AHI] ≥5 events/hour). [35]
