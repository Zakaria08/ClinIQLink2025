        "title": "Methotrexate",
        "content": "Mechanism of action Methotrexate is an antimetabolite of the antifolate type. It is thought to affect cancer and rheumatoid arthritis by two different pathways. For cancer, methotrexate competitively inhibits dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), an enzyme that participates in the tetrahydrofolate synthesis. The affinity of methotrexate for DHFR is about 1000-fold that of folate. DHFR catalyses the conversion of dihydrofolate to the active tetrahydrofolate. Folic acid is needed for the de novo synthesis of the nucleoside thymidine, required for DNA synthesis. Also, folate is essential for purine and pyrimidine base biosynthesis, so synthesis will be inhibited. Methotrexate, therefore, inhibits the synthesis of DNA, RNA, thymidylates, and proteins.",

        "content": "Folate monoglutamates and classical antifols such as methotrexate (MTX) are converted intracellularly to poly-gamma-glutamyl forms by folylpolyglutamate synthetase (FPGS). Folylpolyglutamates are absolutely essential for cell survival and proliferation. MTX polyglutamates are strongly implicated in the cytotoxic mechanism of this drug. Two new types of antifol could be targeted toward polyglutamate synthesis. One type would be structurally analogous to a folate monoglutamate or MTX, except it would not form polyglutamates. In the case of a folate, this analog might induce cellular deficiency by displacing natural folates. In the case of MTX, the analog might have a therapeutic advantage if MTX polyglutamates are involved primarily in host toxicity. The second approach is through direct inhibitors of FPGS. Two relevant MTX analogs have been synthesized and tested: 4-amino-10-methylpteroyl-4-fluoroglutamate does not form polyglutamates or does so extremely poorly; the second, 4-amino-10-methylpteroyl-2,5-diaminopentanoate, is an inhibitor of mammalian FPGS, as predicted from the work of Shane and co-workers with reduced pteroyl-2,5-diaminopentanoate.",

        "content": "Five analogues of methotrextate (MTX), 10-deazaaminopterin (10-DAM), and 10-ethyl-10-deazaaminopterin (10-EDAM) in which the glutamate moiety was replaced by either a gamma-methyleneglutamate or beta-hydroxyglutamate were synthesized and evaluated for their antifolate activity. These analogous are 4-amino-4-deoxy-N10-methylpteroyl-beta-hydroxyglutamic acid (1), 4-amino-4-deoxy-10-deazapteroyl-beta-hydroxyglutamic acid (2), 4-amino-4-deoxy-N10-methylpteroyl-gamma-methyleneglutamic acid (3, MMTX), 4-amino-4-deoxy-10-deazapteroyl-gamma-methyleneglutamic acid (4, MDAM), and 4-amino-4-deoxy-10-ethyl-10-deazapteroyl-gamma-methyleneglutamic acid (5, MEDAM). None of these compounds were metabolized to the respective polyglutamate derivative as judged by their inability to serve as substrates for CCRF-CEM human leukemia cell folylpolyglutamate synthetase (FPGS) in vitro. All compounds inhibited recombinant human-dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) at nearly equivalent magnitude as MTX. Growth-inhibition studies with H35 hepatoma, Manca human lymphoma, and CCRF-CEM human leukemia cells established greater cytotoxic effects with compounds 3-5 than with compounds 1 and 2. gamma-Methyleneglutamate derivatives 3-5 were transported to H35 hepatoma cells better than MTX or beta-hydroxyglutamate derivatives 1 and 2. Compound 3 was 2.5 times better than MTX in competing with folinic acid transport in H35 hepatoma cells. Compound 1 did not have a significant inhibitory effect on folinic acid transport even at 50 microM under identical conditions. The IC50 for compound 1 against H35-hepatoma cell growth was 8.5-fold higher than MTX. Compounds with the gamma-methyleneglutamate moiety (3-5) exhibited almost equal or lower IC50 values than MTX against the growth of CCRF-CEM human leukemia cells. These studies show that on continuous exposure, the non-polyglutamylatable inhibitors DHFR (3-5) can exhibit superior antifolate activity compared to the polyglutamylatable methotrexate, presumably due to their enhanced transport to these cell lines. Compounds 3-5 appear to be excellent models to study the role of polyglutamylation of antifolates in antitumor activity and host toxicity.",
