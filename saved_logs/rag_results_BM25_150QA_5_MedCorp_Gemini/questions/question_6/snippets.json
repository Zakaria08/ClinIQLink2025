Apart from aspirin against migraines she had never taken any medicine, not even herbal teas. She did not contract German measles, chickenpox, or urinary infections, and was not prone to hypertension or diabetes. In April 1986, aged 111, she was sent to a hospital for heart failure and treated with digoxin. Later she suffered from arthropathy in the ankles, elbows, and wrists, which was successfully treated with anti-inflammatory medication. Her arterial blood pressure was 140mm/70mm, her pulse 84/min. Her height was , and her weight , showing little variation from previous years. She scored well on mental tests, except on numeric tasks and recall of recent events.",

This management did not improve her symptoms, and she has gradually worsened over six months. She reports a 20-pound (9 kg) intentional weight loss over the past year. She denies camping, spelunking, or hunting activities. She denies any sick contacts. A brief review of systems is negative for fever, night sweats, palpitations, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, neural sensation changes, muscular changes, and increased bruising or bleeding. She admits a cough, shortness of breath, and shortness of breath on exertion.",

        "title": "Prophylactic subcutaneous heparin therapy as a cause of bilateral adrenal hemorrhage.",
        "content": "A 63-year-old white woman was admitted to the hospital for bilateral total knee arthroplasty. She was given prophylactic subcutaneous heparin therapy postoperatively. Three days later, she had a brief hypotensive episode and an unexplained drop in hemoglobin level. Seven days postoperatively, she became confused and disoriented while complaining of pain in her right side and, later, under her left breast. She also had nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and a vague feeling of \"illness.\" Her condition deteriorated progressively, with blood pressure falling to 65/40 mm Hg and a temperature of 39.7 degrees C. Blood, urine, and cerebrospinal-fluid culture samples showed no evidence of infection. A diagnosis of acute adrenal insufficiency was made. Following corticosteroid therapy, the patient's condition improved markedly. Of interest in our patient was that she had had no antecedent hypotension, sepsis, fever, or surgical complications. Acute adrenal hemorrhage is often overlooked because the symptoms are attributed to other conditions, especially to sepsis. Acute adrenal hemorrhage should be suspected in any stressed patient in whom an abrupt deterioration associated with back or abdominal pain, hypotension, and unexplained fever are noted. Suspicion should be raised regarding those patients who are receiving anticoagulant therapy (including subcutaneous heparin prophylaxis) at the time of deterioration. With increased awareness, more cases of acute bilateral adrenal hemorrhage and subsequent adrenal insufficiency can be recognized ante mortem and treated.",
