Document 1 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Nomograms To better assess risk and guide treatment selection, many groups have developed prognostic models or nomograms that use a combination of the initial clinical T stage, biopsy Gleason score, and baseline PSA. Some use discrete cut points (PSA <10 or ≥10 ng/mL; Gleason score of ≤6, 7, or ≥8); others employ nomograms that use PSA and Gleason score as continuous variables. More than 100 nomograms have been reported to predict the probability that a clinically significant prostate cancer is present, disease extent (organ-confined vs non–organ-confined, node-negative or -positive), or the probability of success of treatment for specific local therapies using pretreatment variables. Considerable controversy exists over what constitutes “high risk” based on a predicted probability of success or failure. In these situations, nomograms and predictive models can only go so far. Exactly what probability of success or failure would lead a physician to recommend and a patient to seek
Document 2 (Title: Prostate Cancer -- Prognosis -- Predictive Tables and Nomograms): Various predictive tables and nomograms are now available to help predict outcomes, positive lymph nodes, and survival after radical prostatectomy based on outcome data from multiple sources. These tools generally include some combination of age, Gleason score, biopsy information, and PSA levels and may also require other clinical information, such as the number of positive biopsies with the percentage of tumor involvement and clinical and pathological staging. [464] Multiple nomograms exist, including the Briganti, Rotterdam, and Stanford models. Three of the most popular nomograms available online for free include the following: Partin tables from Johns Hopkins University [465] [466] [467] Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center prostate cancer nomograms [212] [468] Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment score from the University of California, San Francisco [469]
Document 3 (Title: The role of molecular techniques in the clinical management of leukemia. Lessons from the Philadelphia chromosome.): The Philadelphia chromosome (Ph1) was the first genetic change to be associated consistently with leukemia, and it is one of the best understood on the molecular level. Because of this, it is an excellent model to investigate the application of molecular techniques to the clinical setting. These techniques are reviewed as are their clinical use in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and transplantation. The Ph1 is caused by the fusion of two genes on chromosomes 9 and 22, resulting in the BCR-ABL fusion gene. This new gene is believed to be the cause of these Ph1-positive leukemias. The ability to detect the BCR-ABL fusion gene evolved from cytogenetic detection to Southern blot analysis, and now includes sophisticated techniques such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods and pulsed-field gels. Diagnosis of the BCR-ABL fusion gene by Southern blot detection of bcr genetic rearrangements is the prototype of molecular cancer diagnosis. The sensitivity and clinical uses of this test are reviewed, especially its application to monitoring the response to treatment. PCR methods enable the researcher to detect 1 CML cell in a population of 10(5) cells. Clinical experience with PCR, especially in transplantation medicine, is providing a better understanding of the meaning of the terms "remission" and "cure." Newer techniques using fluorescent in situ hybridization have considerable potential for BCR-ABL detection, but no clinical experience has been gained with these techniques currently. The diagnosis of the BCR-ABL fusion gene in ALL has important clinical implications because it is the most common molecular genetic change in adult ALL and is associated with short remissions and poor outcome in all age groups. Diagnosis of the BCR-ABL fusion in ALL is difficult because the molecular findings are more heterogeneous than they are in CML. The methods available and their accuracy and sensitivity are compared. A review of their clinical impact is included.

Document 5 (Title: Clinical significance of the BCR-ABL fusion gene in adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia: a Cancer and Leukemia Group B Study (8762).): The Philadelphia (Ph1) chromosome, or its molecular counterpart, the BCR-ABL fusion gene, is a rare but important prognostic indicator in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), but its impact on adult ALL has not been well ascertained. A prospective study of the BCR-ABL fusion gene was begun on patients entered on clinical trials conducted by the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB). All patients received intensive, multiagent chemotherapy that included daunorubicin. Over 2 years, 56 patients were studied for molecular evidence of a BCR-ABL gene using Southern blot and pulsed-field gel hybridization analysis. Results were compared with cytogenetic detection of a Ph1 chromosome, and clinical features were compared for the BCR-ABL-positive and -negative groups. Molecular methods detected the BCR-ABL gene in 30% of cases compared with cytogenetic detection of the Ph1 chromosome in only 23%. The majority of cases (76%) showed the p190 gene subtype similar to pediatric ALL; the BCR-ABL-positive cases displayed a more homogeneous immunophenotype than the BCR-ABL-negative cases and were predominantly CALLA positive (86%) and B-cell surface antigen positive (82%). The rate of achieving complete remission was similar in the BCR-ABL-positive and -negative groups (71% and 77%, respectively, P = .72). There were more early relapses in the BCR-ABL-positive group, resulting in a shorter remission duration that was especially marked in the CALLA-positive and B-cell antigen-positive populations. These preliminary data suggest that the impact of the BCR-ABL gene on clinical outcome in ALL may be on maintenance of complete remission (CR) rather than achievement of CR when aggressive, multiagent chemotherapy is used. This study identifies the BCR-ABL gene as an important factor in adult ALL and demonstrates the utility of molecular methods for its accurate diagnosis.
