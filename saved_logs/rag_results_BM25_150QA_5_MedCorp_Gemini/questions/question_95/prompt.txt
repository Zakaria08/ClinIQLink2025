Document 1 (Title: When a solution is not a solution: Medicaid and Health Maintenance Organizations.): Health Maintenance Organization (HMOs) are repeatedly described as a general solution to the health care crisis and a specific solution to the problems confronting Medicare and Medicaid. The potential incorporation of HMOs into Medicaid has promised to improve the states' ability to accurately budget program expenditures, simplify management, eliminate abusive practices directly linked to fee-for-service (e.g., billing for undelivered services for providing unnecessary care) and, most important, contain costs. At the same time it has promised to increase access to mainstream medicine. Experience has shown, however, that the promise has often been severely compromised by unethical HMO marketing practices, inadequacy of services and excessive administrative costs. This article examines some of the reasons: the political process which created HMOs, the rhetorical claims which exaggerated the strengths of prepaid group practice and distorted the formulation of policy, and the peculiar characteristics of the Medicaid program which have caused Medicaid HMOs to deviate considerably from theoretical expectations.
Document 2 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Medicaid is a state–federal partnership whose greatest single expenditure is nursing home care. Thus, the need for chronic daily assistance with personal care in a nursing home consumes a large part of most state Medicaid budgets as well as personal assets. Accordingly, alternatives to chronic nursing-home care are of great interest to states, patients, and families. Some states have developed Medicaid-funded day-care programs, sometimes based on the Program for All-Inclusive Day programs Medical, surgical, and psychiatric services that cannot be provided in less complex settings Resuscitation, stabilization, triage, disposition Hospital-based residential program providing team-based, physician-supervised, intensive therapeutic rehabilitation for specific diagnoses Chronic, urgent, and preventive services Medical, nursing, and rehabilitative services after hospitalization, often based in hospitals or nursing homes
Document 3 (Title: Managed Care -- Definition/Introduction): Over time, some less traditional HMOs emerged where the PCP does not serve as the gatekeeper, and the patient may self-referral to a specialist. However, for the service to be covered and paid for by the managed care plan, the patient is still limited to only receiving care and service from network providers. HMOs' utilization and quality management programs collect much data on the care and services authorized and provided by the PCP and other providers. This data is communicated to the PCP and other network providers regularly as the financial incentives revolve around compliance with the managed care plan’s utilization and quality programs’ targets. For the patients, the financial incentive is that they receive insurance coverage only for services that occur within the network.
Document 4 (Title: Case management (US healthcare system)): Case management focuses on delivering personalized services to patients to improve their care, and involves four steps: Referral of new patients (perhaps from another service if the client has relocated to a new area out of previous jurisdiction, or if client no longer meets the target of previous service, such as requiring a greater level of care. Alternatively, they may be referred after having been placed on an ITO or in an inpatient unit. Planning & delivery of care Evaluation of results for each patient & adjustment of the care plan Evaluation of overall program effectiveness & adjustment of the program In the context of a health insurer or health plan it is defined as: Specific types of case management programs include catastrophic or large claim management programs, maternity case management programs, and transitional care management programs. Functions Health insurer and HMO Case managers working for health insurers and HMOs typically do the following:
Document 5 (Title: Managed Care -- Definition/Introduction): The types of managed care insurance or benefit management approaches have also evolved. Initially, managed care was synonymous with a health maintenance organization or HMO approach. [6] In the traditional HMO model, patients enrolled select a primary care provider (PCP) who receives a PMPM to provide care and coordinate all services for that patient. The PCP serves as the patient’s gatekeeper for all necessary services and must provide a referral for the patient to be seen by a subspecialist or to receive imaging or laboratory studies. The PCP is expected to manage and oversee the care so that only appropriate care and services are provided according to available evidence or consistent with standardized care pathways. Only network providers are available to the patient in an HMO, so specialists, hospitals, pharmacies, imaging centers, and laboratories are preselected, credentialed, and contracted by the HMO. In the case of an HMO with a gatekeeper model, coverage is only available for care and services authorized by their PCP.
