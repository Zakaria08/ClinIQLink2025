Document 1 (Title: Clinical trial): Informed consent is a legal process in which a recruit is instructed about key facts before deciding whether to participate. Researchers explain the details of the study in terms the subject can understand. The information is presented in the subject's native language. Generally, children cannot autonomously provide informed consent, but depending on their age and other factors, may be required to provide informed assent. Statistical power In any clinical trial, the number of subjects, also called the sample size, has a large impact on the ability to reliably detect and measure the effects of the intervention. This ability is described as its "power", which must be calculated before initiating a study to figure out if the study is worth its costs. In general, a larger sample size increases the statistical power, also the cost.
Document 2 (Title: Debriefing the Interprofessional Team in Medical Simulation -- Issues of Concern): Organizational-, participant-, and debriefer-specific barriers can adversely influence inter-professional team SBT debriefings.  At the organizational level, both a lack of institutional support for SBT and the absence of an appropriate learning structure for it can undermine SBT activities. Manifestations may include off-limit topics of discussion or the absence of a safe learning environment. Identifying and recruiting a champion within the leadership group can address these difficult issues. Participant-specific barriers can arise due to learner-specific characteristics or situation-specific issues that lead to difficulties with participants during the debriefing process. Learner-specific examples include the shy participant, the indifferent participant, the dominating participant with poor insight, and the dominating participant showing off.  Situation-specific examples include participants who react emotionally or defensively because of the scenario. [19] Strategies to address participant-specific barriers include both non-verbal and verbal communicative techniques.  Important non-verbal methods involve remaining silent to invite participant input, establishing eye contact, and using body language to project an inviting attitude.  Communicative strategies include a variety of techniques such as normalization, validation, generalization, paraphrasing, broadening, previewing, and naming the dynamic.

Document 3 (Title: Increasing participation by private physicians in the EPSDT Program in rural North Carolina.): This study evaluated a method to increase physicians' participation in Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis and Treatment (EPSDT), a preventive health care program for Medicaid eligible children. Use of EPSDT can improve children's health status and reduce health care costs. Although the potential benefits of EPSDT are clear, the program is underused; low rates of participation by private physicians contribute to underuse. This study targeted a population of 73 primary care physicians in six rural counties in North Carolina where the physician supply, their participation in EPSDT, and use of EPSDT were low. A mailed intervention packet attempted to address barriers to participation perceived by private providers. The packet consisted of a carefully constructed letter, an informative journal article, and an educational pamphlet. Participation in EPSDT screening increased from 15 to 25 private physicians (67 percent), at a cost, on average, of less than $30 per recruited provider. Suggestions are presented for adapting the intervention packet to other settings.
Document 4 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): that recruited high-risk participants (with at least one risk factor) was 2.43%. We have rounded these off to 10 and 30 per 1000 respectively.3The confidence interval crosses no difference and does not rule out a small increase.4The measurement of oedema was not validated or blinded to the intervention. All of these studies were conducted by the same investigators.5If there are very few or no events and the number of participants is large, judgement about the quality of evidence (particularly judgements about precision) may be based on the absolute effect. Here the quality rating may be considered “high” if the outcome was appropriately assessed and the event, in fact, did not occur in 2821 studied participants.6None of the other trials reported adverse effects, apart from 4 cases of superficial vein thrombosis in varicose veins in the knee region that were compressed by the upper edge of the stocking in one trial.Figure 51-2.
