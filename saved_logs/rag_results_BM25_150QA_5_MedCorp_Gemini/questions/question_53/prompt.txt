Document 1 (Title: Urticaria Pigmentosa  -- Treatment / Management): The management of cutaneous mastocytosis begins with practical measures, such as the use of lukewarm water for bathing, air conditioning during hot weather, and avoidance of triggers for mast cell degranulation. Treatment is symptomatic for patients with cutaneous mastocytosis.
Document 2 (Title: Idiopathic acquired cold urticaria in North India.): Forty-three otherwise healthy patients mostly between the ages of 10 and 40 were seen in North India during a two-year period with urticaria which developed on taking a cold water bath, exposure to cold winds, evaporation of rain water or sweat in that order of frequency. There was no familial predisposition to cold urticaria or atopic disorders. The refrigeration test for cryo-proteins was negative. Only one patient developed a wheal on contact with ice but 38 of 43 patients showed an exaggerated erythema response to a cold-pressure test (cryo-stimulation test).
Document 3 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): vascular collapse; it is distinguished from cholinergic urticaria by presenting with wheals of conventional size and by not occurring with fever or a hot bath. Cold urticaria is local at body areas exposed to low ambient temperature or cold objects but can progress to vascular collapse with immersion in cold water (swimming). Solar urticaria is subdivided into six groups by the response to specific portions of the light spectrum. Vibratory angioedema may occur after years of occupational exposure or can be idiopathic; it may be accompanied by cholinergic urticaria. Other rare formsofphysicalallergy,alwaysdefinedbystimulus-specificelicitation, include local heat urticaria, aquagenic urticaria fromcontactwithwater of anytemperature (sometimesassociatedwithpolycythemiavera),and contact urticaria from direct interaction with some chemical substance.
Document 4 (Title: Aquagenic urticaria): The hives associated with aquagenic urticaria are typically small (approximately 1–3 mm), red- or skin-colored welts (called wheals) with clearly defined edges. It most commonly develops on the neck, upper trunk and arms, although it can occur anywhere on the body. Once the water source is removed, the rash generally fades within 30 to 60 minutes. Water in all forms, such as tap or sea water, swimming pool water, sweat, tears, and saliva can induce the lesions. Cause The cause of aquagenic urticaria is not fully understood; however, several mechanisms have been proposed. Interaction between water and a component in or on the skin or sebum has been suggested. This theory suggests that a substance is formed by this interaction, the absorption of which causes perifollicular mast cell degranulation with release of histamine.
Document 5 (Title: Pediatrics_Nelson): The most common physical urticaria is dermatographism, affecting 2% to 5% of persons. Dermatographism means “writing on the skin” and is easily diagnosed by firmly scratching the skin with a blunt point, such as the wooden tip of a cotton swab or tongue depressor. It is characterized by an urticarial reaction localized to the site of skin trauma. It has been suggested that trauma induces an IgE-mediated reaction causing histamine to be released from the mast cells. Cholinergic urticaria, characterized by the appearance of 1to 3-mm wheals surrounded by large erythematous flares after an increase in core body temperature, occurs commonly in young adults. Lesions may develop during strenuous exercise, after a hot bath, or emotional stress. The lack of airway symptoms differentiates it from exercise-induced anaphylaxis.
