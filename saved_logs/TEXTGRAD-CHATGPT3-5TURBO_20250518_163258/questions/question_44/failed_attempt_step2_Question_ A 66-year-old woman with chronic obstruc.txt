Question: A 66-year-old woman with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is brought to the emergency department because of fever, body aches, malaise, and a dry cough. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 30 years but quit smoking 1 year ago. She lives with her daughter and her granddaughter, who attends daycare. Her temperature is 38.1°C (101°F). Physical examination shows bilateral conjunctivitis, rhinorrhea, and erythematous tonsils without exudates. Further testing confirms infection with an enveloped orthomyxovirus. Administration of a drug with which of the following mechanisms of action is most appropriate?
Options:
A. Inhibition of nucleoside reverse transcriptase
B. Inhibition of proton translocation
C. Inhibition of neuraminidase

== Improved Full Prompt ==
Evaluate the following scenario: A 66-year-old woman with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is seeking treatment. Identify the drug and its mechanism of action that would most effectively manage her COPD symptoms. Consider factors such as the drug's efficacy, side effects, and how it targets the underlying pathophysiology of COPD.
