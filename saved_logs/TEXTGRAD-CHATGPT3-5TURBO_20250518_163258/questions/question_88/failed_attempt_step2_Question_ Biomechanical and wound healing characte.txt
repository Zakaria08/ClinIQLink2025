== Original Prompt ==
Question: Biomechanical and wound healing characteristics of corneas after excimer laser keratorefractive surgery: is there a difference between advanced surface ablation and sub-Bowman's keratomileusis?
Options:
A. True
B. False

Please respond strictly with one of the following JSON formats:

== Answer ==
{"answer": "True"}

== Feedback ==
Incorrect answer: The prompt asks for a comparison of biomechanical and wound healing characteristics, which cannot be answered with a simple true/false; the prompt should be revised to ask a question that can be answered with true or false.

== Improved Full Prompt ==
Can you provide a detailed comparison of the biomechanical and wound healing characteristics of corneas after advanced surface ablation versus sub-Bowman's keratomileusis?
