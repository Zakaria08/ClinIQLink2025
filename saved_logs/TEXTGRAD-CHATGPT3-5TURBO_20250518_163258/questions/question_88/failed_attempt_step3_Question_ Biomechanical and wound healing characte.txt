== Original Prompt ==
Question: Biomechanical and wound healing characteristics of corneas after excimer laser keratorefractive surgery: is there a difference between advanced surface ablation and sub-Bowman's keratomileusis?
Options:
A. True
B. False

Please respond strictly with one of the following JSON formats:
{"answer": "True"}
or
{"answer": "False"}

Please respond **only** with a single valid JSON object in the following format:
{"answer": "True"}  ← if the answer is true
{"answer": "False"} ← if the answer is false
Do not include any other text or comments. Output must be strictly JSON.

== Full Prompt ==

Options:
A. True
B. False

Please respond strictly with one of the following JSON formats:
{"answer": "True"}
or
{"answer": "False"}

== Feedback ==
Incorrect answer: The prompt requires a detailed comparison, not a true/false response, and should be revised to ask a question that can be answered with "True" or "False."

== Improved Full Prompt ==
Could you provide an in-depth analysis comparing the biomechanical properties and healing characteristics of corneas post-advanced surface ablation and after sub-Bowman's keratomileusis procedures?
