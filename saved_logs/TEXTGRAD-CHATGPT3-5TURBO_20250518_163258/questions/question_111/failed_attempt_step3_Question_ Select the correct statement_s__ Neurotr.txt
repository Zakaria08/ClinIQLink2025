== Original Prompt ==
Question: Select the correct statement(s): Neurotransmitter receptors can be coupled:
Options:
1. To an ion channel
2. To adenylcyclase
3. To a tyrosine kinase
4. To a phospholipase C
5. To a membrane transporter

Respond strictly in valid JSON format as shown below:
{"answer": ["1", "3"]} ← if options 1 and 3 are correct
Only output the JSON object. Do not include explanations, labels, markdown, or any other text.

== Full Prompt ==
Please identify the correct statements that explain the different ways in which neurotransmitter receptors may be coupled.

Options:
1. To an ion channel
2. To adenylcyclase
3. To a tyrosine kinase
4. To a phospholipase C
5. To a membrane transporter

Respond strictly in valid JSON format as shown below:

== Answer ==
{"answer": ["1", "2", "4", "5"]}

== Feedback ==
Incorrect answer: The answer incorrectly includes "5" and omits "2" and "3"; the prompt should clarify that membrane transporters are not typically coupled to neurotransmitter receptors to prevent confusion.

== Improved Full Prompt ==
Identify and explain the mechanisms through which neurotransmitter receptors are coupled, ensuring correct and comprehensive coverage of each method.
