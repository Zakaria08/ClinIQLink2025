== Original Prompt ==
Question: A 43-year-old woman presents to the emergency department complaining of palpitations, dry cough, and shortness of breath for 1 week. She immigrated to the United States from Korea at the age of 20. She says that her heart is racing and she has never felt these symptoms before. Her cough is dry and is associated with shortness of breath that occurs with minimal exertion. Her past medical history is otherwise unremarkable. She has no allergies and is not currently taking any medications. She is a nonsmoker and an occasional drinker. She denies illicit drug use. Her blood pressure is 100/65 mm Hg, pulse is 76/min, respiratory rate is 23/min, and temperature is 36.8°C (98.2°F). Her physical examination is significant for bibasilar lung crackles and a non-radiating, low-pitched, mid-diastolic rumbling murmur best heard at the apical region. In addition, she has jugular vein distention and bilateral pitting edema in her lower extremities. Which of the following best describes the infectious agent that led to this patient’s condition?
Options:
A. A bacterium that induces partial lysis of red cells with hydrogen peroxide
B. A bacterium that induces complete lysis of the red cells of a blood agar plate with an oxygen-sensitive cytotoxin
C. A bacterium that induces heme degradation of the red cells of a blood agar plate
D. A bacterium that requires an anaerobic environment to grow properly

}

== Feedback ==
Incorrect answer: The answer should be "A" as the symptoms and history suggest rheumatic fever caused by Streptococcus pyogenes, which induces partial lysis of red cells with hydrogen peroxide; the prompt could specify the connection to rheumatic fever to guide the answer.
