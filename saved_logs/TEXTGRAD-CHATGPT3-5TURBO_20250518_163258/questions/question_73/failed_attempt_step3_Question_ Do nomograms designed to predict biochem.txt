== Original Prompt ==
Question: Do nomograms designed to predict biochemical recurrence (BCR) do a better job of predicting more clinically relevant prostate cancer outcomes than BCR?
Options:
A. True
B. False

Please respond strictly with one of the following JSON formats:
{"answer": "True"}
or
{"answer": "False"}

Please respond **only** with a single valid JSON object in the following format:
{"answer": "True"}  ← if the answer is true
{"answer": "False"} ← if the answer is false
Do not include any other text or comments. Output must be strictly JSON.

== Full Prompt ==
Evaluate the effectiveness of nomograms in predicting significant prostate cancer outcomes and compare their accuracy to predictions made using biochemical recurrence (BCR) indicators alone.

Options:
A. True
B. False

Please respond strictly with one of the following JSON formats:
{"answer": "True"}
or
{"answer": "False"}

Please respond **only** with a single valid JSON object in the following format:

== Answer ==
{"answer": "True"}

== Feedback ==
Incorrect answer: The prompt requires a comparison and evaluation, not a true/false response; the prompt should be revised to ask a specific true/false question about nomograms and BCR indicators.

== Improved Full Prompt ==
Assess how accurately nomograms can predict significant prostate cancer outcomes, and compare this accuracy to predictions made exclusively using biochemical recurrence (BCR) indicators.
