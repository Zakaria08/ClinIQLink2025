== Original Prompt ==
Question: Do nomograms designed to predict biochemical recurrence (BCR) do a better job of predicting more clinically relevant prostate cancer outcomes than BCR?
Options:
A. True
B. False

== Answer ==
{
    "answer": "True"
}

== Feedback ==
Incorrect answer: The answer should be "False" because nomograms predicting BCR are not necessarily better at predicting more clinically relevant outcomes, and the prompt should clarify the basis for comparison to avoid ambiguity.

== Improved Full Prompt ==
Assess whether nomograms that predict biochemical recurrence (BCR) can more accurately predict significant prostate cancer outcomes compared to BCR alone.
