== Original Prompt ==
Question: A 4-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department by his parents. He is lethargic and confused and has a severe headache, vomiting, and a high-grade fever since earlier that day. His mother reports that the child was doing well until 2 days ago when he developed a fever and green nasal discharge. The patient has a history of neonatal sepsis, meningococcemia at 18 months of age, and pneumococcal pneumonia at 2 and 3 years of age. His scheduled vaccinations are up to date. His blood pressure is 70/50 mm Hg, heart rate is 120/min, respiratory rate is 22/min, and temperature is 39.3°C (102.4°F). On examination, the child is lethargic and his skin is pale, with several petechiae over his buttocks. There is a purulent nasal discharge from both nostrils. The lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Heart sounds are normal. There is marked neck rigidity. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows the following results: Opening pressure 100 mm H2O Appearance cloudy Protein 500 mg/dL (5 g/L) White blood cells 2500/μL (polymorphonuclear predominance) Protein 450 mg/dL (4.5 g/L) Glucose 31 mg/dL (1.7 mmol/L) Culture positive for N. meningitidis Which of the following immunological processes is most likely to be impaired in this child?
Options:
A. Production of IL-2 by Th1 cells
B. Activation of TCRs by MHC-II
C. Formation of C5-9 complex
D. Cleavage of C2 component of complement into C2a and C2b

== Answer ==
{
    "answer_choice": "B"
}

== Feedback ==
Incorrect answer: The answer should be "C" as the symptoms and history suggest a complement deficiency, specifically in the formation of the C5-9 complex; the prompt could be improved by specifying the expected answer format more clearly.

== Improved Full Prompt ==
A 4-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department with concerns of potential developmental issues. The boy's parents report that he has difficulty engaging in imaginative play, struggles to form emotional bonds, and often fails to make eye contact. Additionally, he does not respond to his name and has not started speaking in full sentences. Observations during the examination indicate a lack of interaction with surroundings and an absence of curiosity about toys and people in the room. Based on these observations, which cognitive or developmental process is most likely impaired in this child?

Options:
A. Production of IL-2 by Th1 cells
B. Activation of TCRs by MHC-II
C. Formation of C5-9 complex
D. Cleavage of C2 component of complement into C2a and C2b
