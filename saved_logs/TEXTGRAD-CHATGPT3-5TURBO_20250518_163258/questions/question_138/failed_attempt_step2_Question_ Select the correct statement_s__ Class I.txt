3. Are formed by an alpha chain associated with beta-2 microglobulin
4. Have CD4 molecule as a ligand
5. Are involved in antigen presentation

== Feedback ==
Incorrect answer: The prompt should specify that Class II histocompatibility molecules are encoded by HLA-DP, -DQ, and -DR loci to avoid confusion with Class I molecules.
