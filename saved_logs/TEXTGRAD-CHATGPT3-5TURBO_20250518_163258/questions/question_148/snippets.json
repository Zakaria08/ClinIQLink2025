As a cheap and effective antiplatelet drug, aspirin serves as the foundation of most antiplatelet strategies. Mechanism of Action Aspirin produces its antithrombotic effect by irreversibly acetylating and inhibiting platelet cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 (Fig. 143-3), a critical enzyme in the biosynthesis of thromboxane A2. At high doses (~1 g/d), aspirin also inhibits COX-2, an inducible COX isoform found in endothelial cells and inflammatory cells. In endothelial cells, COX-2 initiates the synthesis of prostacyclin, a potent vasodilator and inhibitor of platelet aggregation.",

Its mechanism of action is the irreversible inhibition of the cyclooxygenase (COX) 1 and 2 enzymes. The action of COX is necessary for the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin (PG) H2. The PGH2 is rapidly converted to several bioactive prostanoids, including thromboxane A2, a potent vasoconstrictor and an inductor of platelet aggregation. Despite the short half-life of aspirin (3 to 6 hours), its irreversible effects last for the complete lifetime of the platelet (8 to 9 days). After the aspirin therapy interruption, platelet function recovery depends on its turnover (approximately 10% per day). [3] [4]",

        "content": "The composition of an evolving arterial thrombus may be a determinant of how effectively pharmacologic agents prevent reocclusion after initially successful thrombolysis. In this study, reoccluding platelet- or fibrin-rich thrombi as delineated by scanning electron microscopy were produced selectively in the femoral arteries of dogs with the use of electrically induced vascular injury or implantation of copper wire, respectively. Initial thrombolysis after intravenous infusion of tissue-type plasminogen activator (1 mg/kg over 30 minutes) was less frequent in the preparation producing platelet-rich thrombi than in that producing fibrin-rich thrombi (lysis in 19 of 24 versus 18 of 18, p = 0.06). In dogs with initial arterial recanalization, intravenous infusion of arginine-glycine-aspartate-O-methyltyrosine amide (RGDY), which competes with fibrinogen for binding to platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptors, prevented reocclusion caused by recurrence of platelet-rich thrombi in six of six dogs within 90 minutes; reocclusion occurred in five of seven saline-infused control dogs (p = 0.02). RGDY was only partially effective in preventing reocclusion caused by recurrence of fibrin-rich thrombi (reocclusion in three of six versus five of six controls, p = 0.54). Similar results were obtained with aspirin in both preparations. At least 98% of platelet aggregation induced ex vivo by collagen was inhibited by either RGDY or aspirin. In contrast with aspirin, however, platelet function returned to normal within 1 hour after discontinuation of RGDY. Thus, the relative proportions of platelets or fibrin incorporated into thrombi influence the efficacy of both tissue-type plasminogen activator for inducing thrombolysis and antiplatelet agents for preventing reocclusion. RGDY is a potent, short-acting inhibitor of platelet aggregation that effectively prevents reocclusion under conditions in which platelet deposition predominates.",

        "content": "Platelet-fibrin thrombi in the lumen of atherostenotic carotid arteries may underlie transient ischemic attacks and cerebral infarction. For this reason, we investigated the antiplatelet and antithrombotic effects of a novel and potent platelet fibrinogen receptor (glycoprotein IIb/IIIa) antagonist (SK&amp;F 106760). The effects of 0.1-3.0 mg/kg i.v. SK&amp;F 106760 on platelet aggregation were examined ex vivo in canine platelet-rich plasma (n = 20). In addition, the antithrombotic effects of SK&amp;F 106760 were compared with those of aspirin in an acute canine model of extracranial carotid artery thrombosis with high-grade stenosis. Sham-operated (n = 4), vehicle-treated (n = 6), SK&amp;F 106760-treated (n = 8), aspirin-treated (n = 9), and SK&amp;F 106760+aspirin-treated (n = 5) dogs were examined. The intravenous administration of SK&amp;F 106760 caused a dose-related inhibition of ex vivo platelet aggregation. In the carotid artery thrombosis model, an occlusive thrombus formed at stenotic sites in the region of the carotid bifurcation. The thrombogenic process caused a progressive reduction in carotid blood flow and reduced the cortical microvascular perfusion and electroencephalographic power. Based on nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, the occlusive events depleted the stores of high-energy phosphates (adenosine triphosphate and phosphocreatine) and increased the lactate concentration in the forelimb somatosensory area of the parietal cortex. In this model, the administration of 1 mg/kg i.v. SK&amp;F 106760 prevented thrombosis of the stenotic carotid artery. Consequently, neurophysiological, cerebral hemodynamic, and metabolic parameters were all improved significantly in the SK&amp;F 106760-treated group. No dog receiving SK&amp;F 106760 reoccluded during the 1-hour posttreatment observation period. In contrast, thrombosis of the carotid artery was associated with neurophysiological deterioration in six of the nine dogs treated with 5 mg/kg i.v. aspirin. Both spontaneous and evoked (increased carotid stenosis) aspirin-resistant thrombosis were abolished by SK&amp;F 106760 treatment. These results suggest that antagonism of fibrinogen binding to platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (the final common pathway for aggregation) may represent a new and more effective antithrombotic approach to the treatment of cerebral transient ischemic attacks and infarction associated with extracranial carotid artery disease.",
