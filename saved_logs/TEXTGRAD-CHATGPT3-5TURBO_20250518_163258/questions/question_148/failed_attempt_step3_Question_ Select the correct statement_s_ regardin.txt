== Answer ==
{"answer": ["1", "3", "5"]}

== Feedback ==
Incorrect answer: The answer includes option "2", which is incorrect because aspirin's action is linked to COX inhibition, not glycoprotein IIb-IIIa; the prompt could specify that explanations are not needed in the JSON output to avoid confusion.
