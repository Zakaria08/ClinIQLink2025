== Original Prompt ==
Question: A 23-year-old man comes to the physician for evaluation of decreased hearing, dizziness, and ringing in his right ear for the past 6 months. Physical examination shows multiple soft, yellow plaques and papules on his arms, chest, and back. There is sensorineural hearing loss and weakness of facial muscles bilaterally. His gait is unsteady. An MRI of the brain shows a 3-cm mass near the right internal auditory meatus and a 2-cm mass at the left cerebellopontine angle. The abnormal cells in these masses are most likely derived from which of the following embryological structures?
Options:
A. Neural tube
B. Surface ectoderm
C. Neural crest
D. Notochord

== Feedback ==
Incorrect answer: The answer should be "A" (Neural tube) as the masses are likely vestibular schwannomas derived from Schwann cells, which originate from the neural crest; the prompt should clarify the embryological origin of Schwann cells to avoid confusion.
