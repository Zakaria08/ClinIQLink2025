== Feedback ==
Incorrect answer: The prompt is unclear as it asks for an explanation but provides options that imply a true/false question; it should be revised to clearly state a true/false statement related to the relationship between mechanical dysfunction, chronic oro-facial pain, and somatisation.

== Improved Full Prompt ==
