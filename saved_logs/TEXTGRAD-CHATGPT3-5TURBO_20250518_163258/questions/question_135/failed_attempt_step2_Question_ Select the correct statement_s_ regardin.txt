== Original Prompt ==
Question: Select the correct statement(s) regarding the significance threshold of a statistical test: The significance threshold:
Options:
1. Is the risk of wrongfully rejecting the null hypothesis
2. Usually has values of 0.95 or 0.99
3. Is also called risk of 2nd kind
4. Is usually noted as alpha
5. Increases if the acceptance interval of the null hypothesis is smaller

Respond strictly in valid JSON format as shown below:
{"answer": ["1", "3"]} ← if options 1 and 3 are correct
Only output the JSON object. Do not include explanations, labels, markdown, or any other text.

== Answer ==
{"answer": ["1", "4"]}

== Feedback ==
Incorrect answer: The answer incorrectly includes option "3" and excludes option "4"; the prompt should specify that the significance threshold is denoted by alpha and is not related to the risk of the second kind.

== Improved Full Prompt ==
Select and explain the correct statement(s) about the significance threshold. Clarify its definition, significance in statistical analysis, and its role in determining the outcome of hypothesis testing.
