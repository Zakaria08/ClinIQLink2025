== Original Prompt ==
Question: Select the correct statement(s) regarding fluorescence spectroscopy:
Options:
1. Fluorescent molecules most often present delocalized electron systems
2. A metal ion never exhibits fluorescence properties
3. Groups that increase electron delocalization increase the fluorescence of the compound
4. The rigidity of a molecule increases the fluorescence yield
5. Quantitative assays are not possible
