Document 1 (Title: First_Aid_Step1): Thyroid cancer Typically diagnosed with fine needle aspiration; treated with thyroidectomy. Complications of surgery include hypocalcemia (due to removal of parathyroid glands), transection of recurrent laryngeal nerve during ligation of inferior thyroid artery (leads to dysphagia and dysphonia [hoarseness]), and injury to the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve during ligation of superior thyroid vascular pedicle (may lead to loss of tenor usually noticeable in professional voice users). Papillary carcinoma Most common, excellent prognosis. Empty-appearing nuclei with central clearing (“Orphan Annie” eyes) A , psamMoma bodies, nuclear grooves (Papi and Moma adopted OrphanAnnie).  risk with RET/PTC rearrangements and BRAF mutations, childhood irradiation. Papillary carcinoma: most Prevalent, Palpable lymph nodes. Good prognosis.
Document 2 (Title: Papillary thyroid cancer): Arguments for total thyroidectomy are: Reduced risk of recurrence, if central compartment nodes are removed at the original surgery. 30-85% of papillary carcinoma is multifocal disease. Hemithyroidectomy may leave disease in the other lobe. However, multifocal disease in the remnant lobe may not necessarily become clinically significant or serve as a detriment to patient survival. Ease of monitoring with thyroglobulin (sensitivity for picking up recurrence is increased in presence of total thyroidectomy, and ablation of the remnant normal thyroid by low dose radioiodine 131 after following a low iodine diet (LID). Ease of detection of metastatic disease by thyroid and neck node ultrasound. Post-operative complications at high-volume thyroid surgery centers with experienced surgeons are comparable to that of hemithyroidectomy. Arguments for hemithyroidectomy:
Document 3 (Title: Thyroid carcinoma. A report of 206 cases from an area with endemic goitre.): A retrospective analysis of 206 cases of thyroid carcinoma treated at a single surgical service in a region with endemic goitre is presented. In contrast to the marked female preponderance in surgically treated benign thyroid disorders, the frequency of thyroid carcinoma was almost equal in the two sexes (males/females = 100/106). The duration of symptoms was, as a rule, short and there was a predominance of advanced lesions (T3N3M1) even among the well-differentiated tumours. Papillary carcinoma was the most common histologic type (45%) but its proportion was considerably lower than usually reported from non-endemic regions. The average TSH level was significantly elevated in the carcinoma group and associated adenomatous changes were found in 40/100 cases which might suggest an etiologic role of increased TSH stimulation. Since most thyroid carcinomas had a very malignant clinical behaviour, surgical treatment aimed at near-total thyroidectomy which was performed in 62% of the cases. During a follow-up of up to eleven years recurrence in the remaining contralateral lobe occurred in 23% of patients with hemithyroidectomy and loco-regional recurrence was seen in 29% of patients with near-total thyroidectomy. Mortality was high in all histologic types, further underlining the aggressive biologic behaviour of thyroid cancers in an endemic area.
Document 4 (Title: Anatomy, Head and Neck, Thyroid Muscles -- Surgical Considerations): The thyroid muscles and surrounding vasculature are essential to consider during surgery in the neck region. The infrahyoid muscles may require incision during thyroid surgery to increase exposure to the thyroid gland. There has been some evidence to show that injury to the infrahyoid muscles during thyroid surgery may impact patients’ voices. The primary finding regarding this injury is that patients’ ability to reach high pitches decreased postoperatively. Additionally, when dissecting the superior pole of the thyroid, it is important not to perform high ligation of the superior thyroid artery. The reason behind this is that the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve is in the vicinity and can be injured. Thus, the patient will present with dysphonia if the nerve has suffered an injury. [8]
Document 5 (Title: Clear cell carcinoma of the thyroid. A case report.): A rare case of clear cell carcinoma of the thyroid is presented herein. A 31-year-old male had a large soft tumor in the right lobe of the thyroid which showed a hot nodule on scintigram with 99mTc. A right hemithyroidectomy was thus performed after the preoperative diagnosis of a functioning tumor had been made. At surgery, a tiny nodule behind the tumor was found and the histopathological diagnoses of the large tumor and the tiny nodule were clear cell carcinoma and papillary carcinoma, respectively. The thyroglobulin stain was positive in the cytoplasm of many clear cells and scattered colloid. This patient has been well without any evidence of recurrence over the past five years following surgery. The biological characteristics of clear cell carcinoma of the thyroid are discussed in this report.

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
Question: A 38-year-old woman undergoes hemithyroidectomy for treatment of localized, well-differentiated papillary thyroid carcinoma. The lesion is removed with clear margins. However, during the surgery, a structure lying directly adjacent to the superior thyroid artery at the upper pole of the thyroid lobe is damaged. This patient is most likely to experience which of the following symptoms?
Options:
A. Voice pitch limitation
B. Ineffective cough
C. Weakness of shoulder shrug
D. Shortness of breath
