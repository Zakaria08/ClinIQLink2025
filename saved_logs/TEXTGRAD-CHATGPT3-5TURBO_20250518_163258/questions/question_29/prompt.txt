Document 1 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): Introduction to Autonomic Pharmacology Bertram G. Katzung, MD, PhD A 56-year-old woman is brought to the university eye center with a complaint of “loss of vision.” Because of visual impair-ment, she has lost her driver’s license and has fallen several times in her home. Examination reveals that her eyelids close involuntarily with a frequency and duration sufficient to pre-vent her from seeing her surroundings for more than brief moments at a time. When she holds her eyelids open with her fingers, she can see normally. She has no other muscle dysfunction. A diagnosis of blepharospasm is made. Using a fine needle, several injections of botulinum toxin type A are made in the orbicularis oculi muscle of each eyelid. After observation in the waiting area, she is sent home. Two days later, she reports by telephone that her vision has improved dramatically. How did botulinum toxin improve her vision? How long can her vision be expected to remain normal after this single treatment?
Document 2 (Title: Root Cause Analysis and Medical Error Prevention -- Function -- Case example 1): A 42-year-old primigravida woman at 34 weeks gestation was brought to the obstetric emergency department at midnight with complaints of severe headache, blurry vision, and right upper quadrant pain for the last 5 to 6 hours. She noted lower extremity edema and facial swelling that was gradually increasing. She has gestational hypertension and, 1 week ago, was prescribed labetalol 200 mg twice a day. On initial presentation, her blood pressure was 190/110 mm Hg on 2 separate occasions, 5 minutes apart. She had gained 2 kilograms since her last antenatal checkup in the clinic a week ago. The patient was diagnosed with severe preeclampsia. The senior obstetric resident ordered a loading dose of magnesium sulfate to prevent imminent seizure. The hospital protocol used an intravenous (IV) and intramuscular (IM) regimen where the patient received a 4 g IV bolus and a 10 g IM dose administered as 5 g in each buttock. The senior resident gave verbal orders for magnesium sulfate administration to the junior resident, who verbally communicated the order to the nurse.
Document 3 (Title: [MRI findings of brain-stem tuberculoma in a case of tuberculous meningitis].): A 54-year-old woman developed headache and slight fever. When she consulted a physician, she could not move either of her eyes to the right. Cranial CT scan revealed no significant findings. Lumbar puncture was performed and CSF examination showed the cell count of 10,304/mm3, glucose level of 10 mg/dl, and total protein value of 270 mg/dl. Her symptoms and laboratory findings suggested meningitis and she was admitted to our hospital. Neurological examination revealed bilateral dilated pupils with sluggish light reflex, right gaze palsy, and hypesthesia of the left side of her face. A diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis was established by a positive test for acid-fast bacillus in CSF, and anti-tuberculous therapy was started at once. One month after the onset of symptoms, her main complaints were double vision and cerebellar ataxia. Both CT and MRI revealed a right brain-stem lesion. Pre-contrast CT could not clearly visualize the lesion but with contrast medium a homogeneously-enhanced circular lesion was shown. MRI on T2WI demonstrated the right brain-stem lesion to have a central bright core with hypointense periphery, which in turn was surrounded by hyperintensity. The lesion appeared isointense with cerebral white matter and the "central bright core" area was demonstrated to be slightly hypointense on T1WI. On post-contrast T1WI (with Gd-DTPA), the lesion showed strong homogeneous enhancement. The CT and MRI findings indicated a brain-stem tuberculoma, which was regarded as the cause of the ocular movement paralysis and cerebellar ataxia. As the clinical symptoms gradually resolved with anti-tuberculous treatment, the MRI appearance of the lesion also improved.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Document 4 (Title: Eye examination): If there is a small, irregular pupil that constricts poorly to light, but normally to accommodation, this is an Argyll Robertson pupil. Ocular motility Ocular motility should always be tested, especially when patients complain of double vision or physicians suspect neurologic disease. First, the doctor should visually assess the eyes for deviations that could result from strabismus, extraocular muscle dysfunction, or palsy of the cranial nerves innervating the extraocular muscles. Saccades are assessed by having the patient move his or her eye quickly to a target at the far right, left, top and bottom. This tests for saccadic dysfunction whereupon poor ability of the eyes to "jump" from one place to another may impinge on reading ability and other skills, whereby the eyes are required to fixate and follow a desired object.
Document 5 (Title: [Recurrent episodic unilateral mydriasis with pleocytosis in the cerebrospinal fluid--a case report].): A 24-year-old female was admitted to our hospital on Aug. 20 in 1986 because of blurred vision and right pupillary dilatation. She had sometimes noticed headache later than 1976, and blurred vision without headache several times a year later than 1983. She had been told her right pupil dilated when she had complained of blurred vision. Neurological examination revealed abnormal findings as follows; diminished sense of smell in the right side, anisocoria (R 8 mm, L 5 mm), bilateral hippus, hypesthesioalgesia in her right face, left trunk and left arm. The pupils were round and contracted promptly to light. Accommodation reflex and ciliospinal reflexes were normal. Neither blepharoptosis nor external ocular muscle paresis were observed. Deep tendon reflexes were normal. Planter responses were flexor. There was no meningeal irritative sign. No abnormal findings were obtained in blood and urine, chest X-p, brain enhanced CT scan, EEG, and cerebral angiography except for slight degree of anemia. Serum TPHA was negative. However, the cell count of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was 18/mm3 (Ly 100%) and decreased to 9/mm3 (Ly 100%) in nine days. Protein content and glucose level of CSF were normal. Pupils were not constricted by 0.125% pilocarpine instillation. Loss of smell and sensory disturbance disappeared within three days and her pupils became isocoric by five days after admission. The patients of episodic unilateral mydriasis without apparent cause had relatively same clinical features as "unilateral springing pupil" proposed by Hallett et al. (1970). Except for mydriasis, they had no abnormal findings of neurological and laboratory examinations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
Question: A 63-year-old woman presents to her primary-care doctor for a 2-month history of vision changes, specifically citing the gradual onset of double vision. Her double vision is present all the time and does not get better or worse throughout the day. She has also noticed that she has a hard time keeping her right eye open, and her right eyelid looks 'droopy' in the mirror. Physical exam findings during primary gaze are shown in the photo. Her right pupil is 6 mm and poorly reactive to light. The rest of her neurologic exam is unremarkable. Laboratory studies show an Hb A1c of 5.0%. Which of the following is the next best test for this patient?
Options:
A. Direct fundoscopy
B. Intraocular pressures
C. MR angiography of the head
D. Temporal artery biopsy
