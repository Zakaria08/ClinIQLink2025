== Original Prompt ==
Question: Among the following statements, which one(s) is (are) correct? A diode array detector is a detector:
Options:
1. Spectrophotometric using monochromatic light
2. Spectrophotometric using polychromatic light
3. Refractometric
4. Usable in gas chromatography
5. Usable in liquid chromatography

Respond strictly in valid JSON format as shown below:

== Answer ==
{"answer": ["2", "5"]}

== Feedback ==
Incorrect answer: The answer incorrectly includes option "1" instead of "2"; the prompt should clarify that diode array detectors use polychromatic light to avoid confusion.
