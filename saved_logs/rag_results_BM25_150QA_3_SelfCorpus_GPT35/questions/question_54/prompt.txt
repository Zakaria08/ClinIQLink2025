Document 1 (Title: Surgical Management of Anorectal Malformations): Anorectal malformations (ARM) encompass a spectrum of congenital anomalies affecting terminal hindgut development, ranging from simple anal stenosis to complex cloacal malformations. Surgical correction represents the definitive management, with operative approach determined by malformation type, particularly the relationship between rectum and puborectalis sling. The primary surgical objectives include establishing anatomical continuity, preserving puborectalis function, and minimizing iatrogenic injury to surrounding structures. Two fundamental approaches have evolved for definitive repair: the posterior sagittal anorectoplasty (PSARP) or "transanal pull-through" and the abdomino-perineal pull-through. The transanal approach, particularly suitable for low and intermediate malformations, involves a posterior sagittal incision providing direct visualization of the external sphincter complex, followed by rectal mobilization and precise placement within the muscle complex. This approach avoids abdominal entry, potentially reducing perioperative morbidity and adhesion formation. The abdomino-perineal approach, traditionally employed for high malformations, combines abdominal mobilization (open or laparoscopic) with perineal reconstruction, allowing direct visualization of the rectum and genitourinary structures from above. Comparative analysis of these approaches has generated substantial debate regarding optimal technique. Short-term outcomes typically favor the transanal approach, with reduced operative duration, decreased analgesia requirements, earlier feeding initiation, and shortened hospitalization. However, long-term functional outcomes represent the more critical endpoints, encompassing continence, constipation, and quality of life measures. Contemporary literature demonstrates no consistent superiority of either approach when comparing these parameters. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses document comparable rates of voluntary bowel movements, soiling, constipation, and reoperation. Fecal continence, the most clinically significant endpoint, shows equivalent outcomes between approaches when controlling for malformation severity and associated anomalies. Factors beyond surgical approach, including malformation complexity, sacral development, associated spinal anomalies, and comprehensive postoperative bowel management, appear to exert greater influence on functional prognosis than the specific technique employed. This equipoise in long-term outcomes underscores the importance of individualized surgical planning based on specific anatomical considerations rather than categorical preference for either approach.
Document 2 (Title: Growth promoting effects of IGF-1): The first demonstration that exogenous IGF-1 stimulates growth was the administration of purified hormone to hypophysectomised rats. After the biosynthesis of IGF-1 identical to the native hormone, trials of its use in humans were begun; first in adults and then in children. Our group was the first to introduce long term administration of biosynthetic IGF-1 to children with primary IGF-1 deficiency—primary GH insensitivity or LS. The finding that daily IGF-1 administration raises serum alkaline phosphatase, which is an indicator of osteoblastic activity, and serum procollagen, in addition to IGFBP-3, led to long term treatment. Treatment of patients with LS was also initiated in other parts of the world. The difference between us and the other groups was that we used a once daily dose, whereas the others administered IGF-1 twice daily. Table 1 compares the linear growth response of children with LS treated by four different groups. It can be seen that before treatment the mean growth velocity was 3–4.7 cm/year and that this increased after IGF-1 treatment to 8.2–9.1 cm/year, followed by a lower velocity of 5.5–6.4 cm/year in the next two years. (In GH treatment the highest growth velocity registered is also in the first year of treatment.) Figure 5 illustrates the growth response to IGF-1 in eight children during the first years of treatment. Ranke and colleagues reported that two of their patients had reached the third centile (Tanner), as did the patient of Krzisnik and Battelino; however, most patients did not reach a normal final height. The reasons may be late initiation of treatment, irregular IGF-1 administration, underdosage, etc. Ranke et al conclude that long term treatment of patients with LS promoted growth and, if treatment is started at an early age, there is a considerable potential for achieving height normalisation. Because no patient in our group was treated since early infancy to final height we cannot confirm this opinion. When the growth response to GH treatment in infants with IGHD was compared with that of IGF-1 in infants with LS we found that the infants with IGHD responded faster and better than those with LS. However, the small number of patients and the differences in growth retardation between the two groups makes it difficult to reach a conclusion. Both hormones stimulated linear growth, but GH seemed more effective than IGF-1. One cause may be the greater growth deficit of the infants with LS than those with IGHD, an insufficient dose of IGF-1, or that there is a need for some GH to provide an adequate stem cell population of prechondrocytes to enable full expression of the growth promoting action of IGF-1, as postulated by Green and colleagues and Ohlson et al. All the above findings based on a few clinical studies with small groups of patients and a few experimental studies remain at present controversial. The crucial question is whether there are any, and if so, whether there are sufficient IGF-1 receptors in the “progenitor cartilage zone” of the epiphyseal cartilage to respond to endocrine and exogenous IGF-1. Using the mandibular condyle of 2 day old ICR mice, Maor et al showed that these condyles, which resemble the epiphyseal plates of the long bones, contain IGF-1 and high affinity IGF-1 receptors also in the chondroprogenitor cell layers, which enables them to respond to IGF-1 in vitro. Sims et al, using mice with GH receptor KO, showed that IGF-1 administration stimulates the growth (width) of the tibial growth plate and that IGF-1 has a GH independent effect on the growth plate. These findings are similar to those found when treating hypophysectomised rats with IGF-1. In conclusion, IGF-1 is an important growth hormone, mediating the anabolic and linear growth promoting effect of pituitary GH protein. It has a GH independent growth stimulating effect, which with respect to cartilage cells is possibly optimised by the synergistic action with GH.
Document 3 (Title: Viral Hepatitis: Epidemiology and Clinical Significance): Hepatitis B virus (HBV) represents a significant global health challenge with distinctive virological characteristics and diverse clinical manifestations. Virological classification identifies this pathogen as a member of the Hepadnaviridae family with a partially double-stranded DNA genome utilizing reverse transcriptase during replication, distinguishing it from RNA viruses causing related hepatic diseases. The virus demonstrates remarkable environmental stability, contributing to its documented role in nosocomial transmission through inadequately sterilized medical equipment, particularly in hemodialysis settings and during certain surgical procedures. Clinical course variability represents a hallmark feature, with acute infection potentially progressing to chronic hepatitis in 5-10% of immunocompetent adults and significantly higher percentages in perinatally infected individuals. This chronicity creates substantial long-term complications including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma through complex inflammatory and oncogenic mechanisms. Particularly concerning manifestations include fulminant hepatic failure occurring in approximately 0.5-1% of acute infections, characterized by massive hepatocellular necrosis, coagulopathy, and encephalopathy with mortality rates exceeding 80% without liver transplantation. Preventive approaches center on recombinant vaccine formulations containing HBsAg produced in yeast expression systems, representing an inactivated subunit vaccine rather than live attenuated preparations. This vaccination strategy has demonstrated remarkable success in reducing infection rates worldwide, though implementation challenges remain in certain regions. Clinical management continues to evolve with development of nucleoside/nucleotide analogs and immunomodulatory approaches for chronic infection, though therapeutic challenges persist particularly regarding viral clearance and prevention of long-term complications.
