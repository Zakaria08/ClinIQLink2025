        "content": "While gallstone disease and alcohol consumption account for approximately 70-80% of acute pancreatitis cases in developed countries, recognition of less common etiologies remains critical for appropriate management, particularly when traditional risk factors are absent. Scorpion envenomation represents an unusual but well-documented cause of acute pancreatitis, particularly in regions where certain scorpion species are endemic. The venom of several scorpion species, notably from the Buthidae family, contains peptide toxins that stimulate massive neurotransmitter release from both sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve terminals. The pathophysiology involves hyperstimulation of pancreatic acinar cells via cholinergic pathways, leading to premature intracellular activation of digestive enzymes and subsequent autodigestion of pancreatic tissue. This mechanism differs from medication-induced pancreatitis seen with drugs such as valproic acid, which causes direct cellular injury, or thiazides, which may induce hypercalcemia. While commonly used medications including aspirin at anti-inflammatory doses have been associated with pancreatitis in case reports, the evidence for causality remains weak in many instances. Similarly, oral contraceptives have not demonstrated conclusive links to pancreatitis outside of their potential to exacerbate hypertriglyceridemia in susceptible individuals. Hypothyroidism may indirectly contribute to pancreatitis risk through its association with hypertriglyceridemia, but does not typically serve as a direct trigger for acute pancreatic inflammation.",

        "title": "Ethylene glycol poisoning",
        "content": "Signs and symptoms Signs of ethylene glycol poisoning depend upon the time after ingestion. Symptoms usually follow a three step progression, although poisoned individuals will not always develop each stage. Stage 1 (30 minutes to 12 hours) consists of neurological and gastrointestinal symptoms and looks similar to alcohol poisoning. Poisoned individuals may appear to be intoxicated, dizzy, lacking coordination of muscle movements, drooling, depressed, and have slurred speech, seizures, abnormal eye movements, headaches, and confusion. Irritation to the stomach may cause nausea and vomiting. Also seen are excessive thirst and urination. Over time, the body metabolizes ethylene glycol into other toxins. Stage 2 (12 to 36 hours) where signs of \u201calcohol\u201d poisoning appear to resolve, underlying severe internal damage is still occurring. An elevated heart rate, hyperventilation or increased breathing effort, and dehydration may start to develop, along with high blood pressure and metabolic acidosis. These symptoms are a result of accumulation of organic acids formed by the metabolism of ethylene glycol. Additionally low calcium concentrations in the blood, overactive muscle reflexes, muscle spasms, QT interval prolongation, and congestive heart failure may occur. If untreated, death most commonly occurs during this period. Stage 3 (24 to 72 hours) kidney failure is the result of ethylene glycol poisoning. In cats, this stage occurs 12\u201324 hours after consuming antifreeze; in dogs, at 36\u201372 hours after consuming antifreeze. During this stage, severe kidney failure is developing secondary to calcium oxalate crystals forming in the kidneys. Severe lethargy, coma, depression, vomiting, seizures, drooling, and inappetence may be seen. Other symptoms include acute tubular necrosis, red blood cells in the urine, excess proteins in the urine, lower back pain, decreased or absent production of urine, elevated blood concentration of potassium, and acute kidney failure. If kidney failure occurs it is typically reversible, although weeks or months of supportive care including hemodialysis may be required before kidney function returns.",

        "content": "Nitroglycerin belongs to a group of drugs called nitrates, which includes many other nitrates like isosorbide dinitrate (Isordil) and isosorbide mononitrate (Imdur, Ismo, Monoket).[35] These agents all exert their effect by being converted to nitric oxide in the body by mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH2),[8] and nitric oxide is a potent natural vasodilator. Nitro   bangy stuff Nitroglycerin in three different forms: intravenous, sublingual spray, and the nitroglycerin patch. In medicine, nitroglycerin is probably most commonly prescribed for angina pectoris, a painful symptom of ischemic heart disease caused by inadequate flow of blood and oxygen to the heart and as a potent antihypertensive agent. Nitroglycerin corrects the imbalance between the flow of oxygen and blood to the heart and the heart's energy demand.[35] There are many formulations on the market at different doses. At low doses, nitroglycerin dilates veins more than arteries, thereby reducing preload (volume of blood in the heart after filling); this is thought to be its primary mechanism of action. By decreasing preload, the heart has less blood to pump, which decreases oxygen requirement since the heart does not have to work as hard. Additionally, having a smaller preload reduces the ventricular transmural pressure (pressure exerted on the walls of the heart), which decreases the compression of heart arteries to allow more blood to flow through the heart. At higher doses, it also dilates arteries, thereby reducing afterload (decreasing the pressure against which the heart must pump).[35] An improved ratio of myocardial oxygen demand to supply leads to the following therapeutic effects during episodes of angina pectoris: subsiding of chest pain, decrease of blood pressure, increase of heart rate, and orthostatic hypotension. Patients experiencing angina when doing certain physical activities can often prevent symptoms by taking nitroglycerin 5 to 10 minutes before the activity. Overdoses may generate methemoglobinemia.[36][37]",
