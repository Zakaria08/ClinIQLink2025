        "content": "Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) represents a paradigmatic hematological malignancy with a well-defined molecular pathogenesis centered on a specific chromosomal abnormality. The hallmark genetic alteration in CML is the Philadelphia chromosome, resulting from a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22, t(9;22)(q34;q11.2). This translocation juxtaposes the ABL1 gene from chromosome 9 with the breakpoint cluster region (BCR) gene on chromosome 22, creating the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene. The resultant fusion protein, typically p210 BCR-ABL1, possesses constitutively activated tyrosine kinase activity that drives aberrant cell proliferation and survival through multiple downstream signaling pathways. Unlike many oncogenic mechanisms involving tumor suppressor loss (such as APC mutations in colorectal cancer) or mutations affecting nuclear receptors (such as retinoic acid receptor alterations in acute promyelocytic leukemia), the BCR-ABL1 fusion represents a gain-of-function aberration. This fusion protein activates multiple signaling cascades, including the JAK-STAT pathway, which becomes dysregulated independently of normal cytokine regulation. Other activated pathways include RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK, PI3K-AKT, and those involving MYC. The pathophysiological consequences include enhanced cellular proliferation, reduced apoptosis, and altered cellular adhesion, collectively manifesting as expansion of the granulocytic lineage with preserved differentiation. Laboratory findings typically include marked leukocytosis with left-shifted granulocytic precursors, basophilia, and reduced leukocyte alkaline phosphatase activity, the latter serving as a diagnostic clue distinguishing CML from reactive leukocytosis. The cellular hyperplasia in bone marrow, particularly of granulocytic precursors, reflects the molecular pathogenesis, with cells retaining differentiation capacity but escaping normal proliferative constraints.",

        "title": "Growth promoting effects of IGF-1",
        "content": "The first demonstration that exogenous IGF-1 stimulates growth was the administration of purified hormone to hypophysectomised rats. After the biosynthesis of IGF-1 identical to the native hormone, trials of its use in humans were begun; first in adults and then in children. Our group was the first to introduce long term administration of biosynthetic IGF-1 to children with primary IGF-1 deficiency\u2014primary GH insensitivity or LS. The finding that daily IGF-1 administration raises serum alkaline phosphatase, which is an indicator of osteoblastic activity, and serum procollagen, in addition to IGFBP-3, led to long term treatment. Treatment of patients with LS was also initiated in other parts of the world. The difference between us and the other groups was that we used a once daily dose, whereas the others administered IGF-1 twice daily. Table 1 compares the linear growth response of children with LS treated by four different groups. It can be seen that before treatment the mean growth velocity was 3\u20134.7 cm/year and that this increased after IGF-1 treatment to 8.2\u20139.1 cm/year, followed by a lower velocity of 5.5\u20136.4 cm/year in the next two years. (In GH treatment the highest growth velocity registered is also in the first year of treatment.) Figure 5 illustrates the growth response to IGF-1 in eight children during the first years of treatment. Ranke and colleagues reported that two of their patients had reached the third centile (Tanner), as did the patient of Krzisnik and Battelino; however, most patients did not reach a normal final height. The reasons may be late initiation of treatment, irregular IGF-1 administration, underdosage, etc. Ranke et al conclude that long term treatment of patients with LS promoted growth and, if treatment is started at an early age, there is a considerable potential for achieving height normalisation. Because no patient in our group was treated since early infancy to final height we cannot confirm this opinion. When the growth response to GH treatment in infants with IGHD was compared with that of IGF-1 in infants with LS we found that the infants with IGHD responded faster and better than those with LS. However, the small number of patients and the differences in growth retardation between the two groups makes it difficult to reach a conclusion. Both hormones stimulated linear growth, but GH seemed more effective than IGF-1. One cause may be the greater growth deficit of the infants with LS than those with IGHD, an insufficient dose of IGF-1, or that there is a need for some GH to provide an adequate stem cell population of prechondrocytes to enable full expression of the growth promoting action of IGF-1, as postulated by Green and colleagues and Ohlson et al. All the above findings based on a few clinical studies with small groups of patients and a few experimental studies remain at present controversial. The crucial question is whether there are any, and if so, whether there are sufficient IGF-1 receptors in the \u201cprogenitor cartilage zone\u201d of the epiphyseal cartilage to respond to endocrine and exogenous IGF-1. Using the mandibular condyle of 2 day old ICR mice, Maor et al showed that these condyles, which resemble the epiphyseal plates of the long bones, contain IGF-1 and high affinity IGF-1 receptors also in the chondroprogenitor cell layers, which enables them to respond to IGF-1 in vitro. Sims et al, using mice with GH receptor KO, showed that IGF-1 administration stimulates the growth (width) of the tibial growth plate and that IGF-1 has a GH independent effect on the growth plate. These findings are similar to those found when treating hypophysectomised rats with IGF-1. In conclusion, IGF-1 is an important growth hormone, mediating the anabolic and linear growth promoting effect of pituitary GH protein. It has a GH independent growth stimulating effect, which with respect to cartilage cells is possibly optimised by the synergistic action with GH.",

        "title": "Thermoregulatory and Cardiovascular Responses to Bathing in Infancy",
        "content": "Syncope during infant bathing represents an uncommon but potentially concerning phenomenon that has generated clinical interest regarding its pathophysiological mechanisms and relationship to other vasovagal conditions. Case series document infants, typically between 4-12 months of age, experiencing sudden pallor, limpness, and brief loss of consciousness during or immediately following water immersion, with rapid and complete recovery. These episodes bear striking resemblance to the clinical presentation of water-induced urticaria, a rare physical urticaria subtype characterized by cutaneous and sometimes systemic reactions following water contact. Overlapping features include the temporal relationship to water exposure, absence of urticarial lesions in some cases, and potential for cardiovascular manifestations including hypotension. Pathophysiological investigation into bathing-related syncope reveals several potential mechanisms. Thermal stress from water immersion triggers complex cardiovascular adaptations, with sudden exposure to warm water inducing peripheral vasodilation and potential venous pooling, reducing effective circulating volume. Concurrent vagal stimulation from temperature-sensitive receptors may precipitate bradycardia, further compromising cerebral perfusion. Autonomic regulation remains incompletely developed in infants, potentially predisposing them to exaggerated vasovagal responses to thermal stimuli. The similarity to water-induced urticaria extends beyond clinical presentation to proposed mechanisms, which include water-induced histamine release through direct mast cell activation or osmotic changes altering cell membrane permeability. While classic water-induced urticaria typically presents with visible cutaneous manifestations, variant forms with predominantly cardiovascular manifestations have been documented. Diagnostic evaluation of affected infants typically includes cardiac assessment to exclude structural or rhythm disturbances, with electroencephalography considered if atypical features suggest seizure activity. Management focuses primarily on preventive measures including temperature modification, maintaining appropriate environmental warmth, limiting immersion duration, and ensuring adequate hydration. Some cases demonstrate responsiveness to antihistamine prophylaxis, providing further evidence for a shared mechanism with physical urticarias. Long-term prognosis appears favorable, with many cases resolving spontaneously with maturation of autonomic regulatory mechanisms, though longitudinal studies remain limited.",
