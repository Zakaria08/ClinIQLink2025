        "content": "Bone remodeling involves coordinated activity between osteoblasts and osteoclasts, with specific biochemical markers reflecting these distinct cellular processes. Laboratory assessment of bone metabolism requires understanding the cellular origin and metabolic significance of various measurable markers. Serum osteocalcin represents a highly specific product of osteoblast synthesis, with this non-collagenous protein incorporated into bone matrix during active bone formation. Its detection in circulation provides a real-time assessment of osteoblastic synthetic activity, with levels fluctuating in response to bone formation rates. Elevated concentrations reliably indicate increased osteoblastic activity in states of high bone turnover, while decreased levels suggest reduced bone formation. Similarly, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase isoenzyme measured in serum represents another direct product of osteoblast cellular activity, with this membrane-bound enzyme released into circulation during active matrix mineralization processes. Its specific assessment through immunoassay or electrophoretic separation distinguishes it from hepatic and intestinal isoenzymes, providing another sensitive indicator of osteoblastic function. In contrast, urinary pyridinolines represent collagen breakdown products released during bone resorption and thus reflect osteoclastic rather than osteoblastic activity. These cross-linking molecules from mature collagen appear in urine during active bone degradation, serving as sensitive markers of bone resorption processes. Similarly, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase measured in serum originates from osteoclasts rather than bone-forming cells, providing assessment of bone resorption activity. Hydroxylysine glycosides measured in urine also derive from collagen degradation during bone resorption phases rather than from active bone formation processes. This differentiation between formation and resorption markers enables comprehensive assessment of overall bone metabolism and remodeling balance through laboratory testing.",

        "title": "Growth promoting effects of IGF-1",
        "content": "The first demonstration that exogenous IGF-1 stimulates growth was the administration of purified hormone to hypophysectomised rats. After the biosynthesis of IGF-1 identical to the native hormone, trials of its use in humans were begun; first in adults and then in children. Our group was the first to introduce long term administration of biosynthetic IGF-1 to children with primary IGF-1 deficiency\u2014primary GH insensitivity or LS. The finding that daily IGF-1 administration raises serum alkaline phosphatase, which is an indicator of osteoblastic activity, and serum procollagen, in addition to IGFBP-3, led to long term treatment. Treatment of patients with LS was also initiated in other parts of the world. The difference between us and the other groups was that we used a once daily dose, whereas the others administered IGF-1 twice daily. Table 1 compares the linear growth response of children with LS treated by four different groups. It can be seen that before treatment the mean growth velocity was 3\u20134.7 cm/year and that this increased after IGF-1 treatment to 8.2\u20139.1 cm/year, followed by a lower velocity of 5.5\u20136.4 cm/year in the next two years. (In GH treatment the highest growth velocity registered is also in the first year of treatment.) Figure 5 illustrates the growth response to IGF-1 in eight children during the first years of treatment. Ranke and colleagues reported that two of their patients had reached the third centile (Tanner), as did the patient of Krzisnik and Battelino; however, most patients did not reach a normal final height. The reasons may be late initiation of treatment, irregular IGF-1 administration, underdosage, etc. Ranke et al conclude that long term treatment of patients with LS promoted growth and, if treatment is started at an early age, there is a considerable potential for achieving height normalisation. Because no patient in our group was treated since early infancy to final height we cannot confirm this opinion. When the growth response to GH treatment in infants with IGHD was compared with that of IGF-1 in infants with LS we found that the infants with IGHD responded faster and better than those with LS. However, the small number of patients and the differences in growth retardation between the two groups makes it difficult to reach a conclusion. Both hormones stimulated linear growth, but GH seemed more effective than IGF-1. One cause may be the greater growth deficit of the infants with LS than those with IGHD, an insufficient dose of IGF-1, or that there is a need for some GH to provide an adequate stem cell population of prechondrocytes to enable full expression of the growth promoting action of IGF-1, as postulated by Green and colleagues and Ohlson et al. All the above findings based on a few clinical studies with small groups of patients and a few experimental studies remain at present controversial. The crucial question is whether there are any, and if so, whether there are sufficient IGF-1 receptors in the \u201cprogenitor cartilage zone\u201d of the epiphyseal cartilage to respond to endocrine and exogenous IGF-1. Using the mandibular condyle of 2 day old ICR mice, Maor et al showed that these condyles, which resemble the epiphyseal plates of the long bones, contain IGF-1 and high affinity IGF-1 receptors also in the chondroprogenitor cell layers, which enables them to respond to IGF-1 in vitro. Sims et al, using mice with GH receptor KO, showed that IGF-1 administration stimulates the growth (width) of the tibial growth plate and that IGF-1 has a GH independent effect on the growth plate. These findings are similar to those found when treating hypophysectomised rats with IGF-1. In conclusion, IGF-1 is an important growth hormone, mediating the anabolic and linear growth promoting effect of pituitary GH protein. It has a GH independent growth stimulating effect, which with respect to cartilage cells is possibly optimised by the synergistic action with GH.",

        "content": "Polycythemia vera represents a clonal myeloproliferative neoplasm with distinctive hematological manifestations resulting from dysregulated erythropoiesis and variable effects on additional hematopoietic lineages. Complete blood count analysis typically reveals characteristic elevation in white blood cell count, with leukocytosis exceeding 12,000/\u00b5L observed in approximately 60-70% of newly diagnosed cases. This leukocytosis predominantly comprises neutrophils without significant left shift or dysplastic features, distinguishing it from reactive leukocytosis or other myeloid neoplasms. Additional laboratory evaluation frequently demonstrates markedly elevated serum vitamin B12 (cobalamin) levels, often exceeding 900 pg/mL due to increased production of transcobalamin I (haptocorrin) from the expanded granulocyte population. This hypervitaminosis B12 represents a useful diagnostic marker distinguishing polycythemia vera from secondary erythrocytosis, though with imperfect sensitivity and specificity. Platelet count evaluation typically reveals moderate thrombocytosis ranging from 400,000-800,000/\u00b5L in most patients, reflecting the multilineage nature of the underlying stem cell dysregulation. Arterial oxygen saturation typically remains normal or elevated (>92%) despite profound erythrocytosis, contrasting with secondary polycythemia resulting from hypoxic stimulation. Functional studies demonstrate significantly elevated leukocyte alkaline phosphatase (LAP) scores, contrasting with the reduced values characteristic of chronic myeloid leukemia and helping to distinguish these entities in challenging cases. Additional laboratory abnormalities may include hyperuricemia, increased histamine levels, and occasionally mild abnormalities in coagulation parameters related to altered blood viscosity and platelet function. Molecular testing now provides definitive diagnostic markers, with JAK2 V617F mutations present in approximately 95% of cases, complementing these characteristic laboratory findings.",
