        "content": "Forty-three otherwise healthy patients mostly between the ages of 10 and 40 were seen in North India during a two-year period with urticaria which developed on taking a cold water bath, exposure to cold winds, evaporation of rain water or sweat in that order of frequency. There was no familial predisposition to cold urticaria or atopic disorders. The refrigeration test for cryo-proteins was negative. Only one patient developed a wheal on contact with ice but 38 of 43 patients showed an exaggerated erythema response to a cold-pressure test (cryo-stimulation test).",

        "title": "Aquagenic urticaria",
        "content": "The hives associated with aquagenic urticaria are typically small (approximately 1\u20133 mm), red- or skin-colored welts (called wheals) with clearly defined edges. It most commonly develops on the neck, upper trunk and arms, although it can occur anywhere on the body. Once the water source is removed, the rash generally fades within 30 to 60 minutes. Water in all forms, such as tap or sea water, swimming pool water, sweat, tears, and saliva can induce the lesions. Cause The cause of aquagenic urticaria is not fully understood; however, several mechanisms have been proposed. Interaction between water and a component in or on the skin or sebum has been suggested. This theory suggests that a substance is formed by this interaction, the absorption of which causes perifollicular mast cell degranulation with release of histamine.",
