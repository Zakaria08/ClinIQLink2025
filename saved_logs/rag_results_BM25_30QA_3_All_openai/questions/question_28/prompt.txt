Document 1 (Title: Colposcopy in women with papillomavirus lesions of the uterine cervix.): Colposcopic examinations for human papillomavirus lesions were performed in 271 women, some of whom had developed concomitant cervical intraepithelial neoplasia since 1981. The colposcopic appearance was classified into one of the following categories: normal, punctate, mosaic, warty, leukoplakial, or combination, and was related to findings in Papanicolaou smears and punch biopsy specimens. There was a good correlation between the colposcopic appearance and the findings in the Papanicolaou smears and punch biopsy specimens, facilitating the diagnosis of the lesions. The accuracy of colposcopy in disclosing the atypias varied according to the growth pattern of the papillomavirus lesions, with the most accurate (100%) in cases of papillomatous condylomas, and the least accurate (50%) in the inverted lesions. White epithelium and combination patterns were most frequently associated with the papillomavirus lesions and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, as evidenced by both cytology and biopsy. During the follow-up, normal colposcopic appearance increased from 32 to 50%, reflecting the established spontaneous regression of a certain percentage of the cervical lesions, or their regression as a result of biopsy. The results are discussed in terms of the mutually complementary roles of colposcopy, cytology, and biopsy, and in view of the clinical behavior of cervical papillomavirus lesions. Colposcopy is mandatory for adequate prospective follow-up of these patients but should not replace cytology and punch biopsy.
Document 2 (Title: Cervical Cancer -- Evaluation): Colposcopy is the diagnostic procedure of choice for evaluating abnormal cytology and/or persistent high-risk HPV infection. The American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology (ASCCP) has issued guidance on procedural indications, and their recommended algorithms are considered standard of care. Multiple colposcopic-guided biopsies and endocervical sampling are often indicated, except during pregnancy. [21] Abnormal colposcopic findings may include acetowhite color change with the application of acetic acid, rich vascularity, atypical vessels, mosaicism, and punctation (see Image. Invasive Cervical Cancer).
Document 3 (Title: Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia): Colposcopy can be painful and so researchers have tried to find which pain relief is best for women with CIN to use. Research suggests that compared to a placebo, the injection of a local anaesthetic and vasoconstrictor (medicine that causes blood vessels to narrow) into the cervix may lower blood loss and pain during colposcopy. HPV testing can identify most of the high-risk HPV types responsible for CIN. HPV screening happens either as a co-test with the Pap smear or can be done after a Pap smear showing abnormal cells, called reflex testing.Frequency of screening changes based on guidelines from the Society of Lower Genital Tract Disorders (ASCCP). The World Health Organization also has screening and treatment guidelines for precancerous cervical lesions and prevention of cervical cancer. Primary prevention HPV vaccination is the approach to primary prevention of both CIN and cervical cancer.
