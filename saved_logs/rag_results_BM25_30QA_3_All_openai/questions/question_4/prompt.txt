Document 1 (Title: Mediation of the actions of insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 on preimplantation mouse embryos in vitro.): Previous studies showed that both insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) stimulate metabolism and growth of preimplantation embryos. Because the effects of insulin occur with very low doses, it was suggested that its effects were mediated by its own receptors. However, the effects of IGF-1 occurred at higher doses, suggestive of cross reaction with the insulin receptor but still in the range for mediation via its own receptor. The aim of this study was to investigate the mediation of the metabolic and growth effects of insulin and IGF-1 using a specific insulin receptor antagonist. The antagonistic B-10 Fab fragment (B-10f) completely blocked stimulation of protein synthesis by both insulin and IGF-1, indicating that the insulin receptor mediates this action of both hormones. Alternately, only insulin's stimulation of inner cell mass mitogenesis and morphological development was inhibited by the B-10 Fab fragment. This showed that growth stimulation by insulin and IGF-1 was mediated via different receptors, insulin through its own receptor and IGF-1 through some other receptor. However, mediation via the IGF-2 receptor is not excluded since IGF-1 stimulates compaction when there is evidence for only the presence of the IGF-2 receptor. In summary, insulin or IGF-1 at physiological concentrations stimulates preimplantation mouse embryos, suggesting an important role for both these growth factors in early development.
Document 2 (Title: Physiology, Pituitary Hormones -- Mechanism -- Growth Hormone): Growth Hormone has a direct and indirect mechanism of action. The direct effect of growth hormone involves growth hormone directly binding to its receptors on target cells to stimulate a response. The indirect effect is mediated by the action of insulin-like growth factor-1(IGF-1), which is secreted by the liver hepatocytes in response to growth hormone. Insulin-like growth factor-1 binds to its receptor, IGF-1R, on the cellular surface. It activates a tyrosine kinase-mediated intracellular signaling pathway that phosphorylates various proteins intracellularly, leading to increased anabolism, cellular replication and division, and metabolism.

Document 3 (Title: Growth hormone): Because polypeptide hormones are not fat-soluble, they cannot penetrate cell membranes. Thus, GH exerts some of its effects by binding to receptors on target cells, where it activates the MAPK/ERK pathway. Through this mechanism GH directly stimulates division and multiplication of chondrocytes of cartilage. GH also stimulates, through the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, the production of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1, formerly known as somatomedin C), a hormone homologous to proinsulin. The liver is a major target organ of GH for this process and is the principal site of IGF-1 production. IGF-1 has growth-stimulating effects on a wide variety of tissues. Additional IGF-1 is generated within target tissues, making it what appears to be both an endocrine and an autocrine/paracrine hormone. IGF-1 also has stimulatory effects on osteoblast and chondrocyte activity to promote bone growth.
