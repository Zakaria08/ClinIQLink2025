Retrospective study consisting of a one in three sample of all children admitted to the hospital's general medical units over one year. All admissions were listed sequentially, and every third patient was included in the study. Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne; a tertiary paediatric hospital with a major primary care role. There were a total of 660 patients eligible for inclusion in the study; 220 were selected, and all records were reviewed. It was found that although 87.7% of admissions could be justified on medical grounds alone, the children quickly recovered with at least 65% being fit for discharge within 12 hours of admission. In spite of this the mean duration of admission was 17.0 hours. The majority of patients were suffering from easily diagnosed and treated disorders, with 78.9% falling into four diagnostic groups (asthma, ingestions, infections, and convulsions). Criteria for admission to a short stay observation area were satisfied in 65% of patients (at the time of the study no such area existed in the hospital). No patients were discharged inappropriately early. A significant number of children require brief hospitalisation for relatively minor illness, but unnecessary delays caused by administrative aspects of hospital admission and relatively infrequent inpatient review by medical staff often lengthen the period of admission. Significant cost savings are possible with the use of a short stay facility, and a large number of patients are suitable for this form of care.",

The study was conducted over a period of 124 days, one month of each season, and included 3,611 children. There was a majority of boys (60.8%) and children older than 7 years (56.8%). The representation of foreign children was 11.2%. Most of the consultations were decided by the parents (86%); 6.2% were sent by a general practitioner and 1.1% by a pediatrician; 6.5% were conveyed through a professional public health service transport. Traumatology was the main surgical etiology and supplied the large majority of benign cases and 23% of the emergencies. Upper respiratory and bronchopulmonary tract infections and gastroenteritis represented 70% of medical etiologies. A complementary investigation, essentially a radiological examination, was carried out in 53.6% of cases. A wound suture was performed in 13% and a plaster immobilization in 9.2% of cases. The hospitalisation's rate was 22%. Emergencies represented 1.8% of cases. A surgical intervention with general anesthesia was performed in 4.4% of cases within 12 hours following the admission. A recent law (ministerial circular: 14.05, 1991) defines the organisation and working principles of the public emergency departments in France as requiring an uninterrupted activity, a continuous medical presence and an area for very short hospitalization. This should improve the quality of the pediatric emergency wards, providing that the financial means will be available.",

Twenty-five children between the ages of 7 and 11 were studied in the out-patient department, 2 weeks before surgery, and again during their hospital stay. Effectiveness of defenses and defense style was measured by a clinical interview and by the Rorschach test. Cortisol production rates were measured by the analysis of 24-hour urine collections at home and again in the hospital. Ward adjustment was also rated by a ward questionnaire. The results indicated no relationship between defense effectiveness and cortisol production rates in the out-patient department and an inverse relationship between cortisol production and defense effectiveness under the stress of hospitalization.

        "content": "The incidence of E. coli pyelonephritis before the age of one year among the children born at Danderyd Hospital during a ten year period was studied. During the study period, 4 or 5 outbreaks of E. coli pyelonephritis occurred among the children who had previously been staying in the hospital's neonatal ward. These outbreaks seemed to have been caused by nosocomial spread of and fecal colonization with certain virulent E. coli strains among the children staying in the ward during certain periods of time. The strains that were spread in the ward seemed to belong to certain pyelonephritogenic E. coli clones of the serotypes O6:K5, O4:K3 and possibly O6:K2. Although the children became fecally colonized with the strains in the neonatal ward, most fell ill some time after they had left the ward. The mean age at the development of their first pyelonephritis was 3.4 months for the boys and 6.2 months for the girls, who had been cared for in this ward. A correlation between the number of infections and the bed occupancy of the ward could be found (p less than 0.01). The risk for a child staying in the ward during an outbreak to develop pyelonephritis was about 5-10%. There was a baseline incidence rate of 0.6-0.7% during non-epidemic periods. During one of the outbreaks there was also an increased incidence rate of E. coli septicemia among the children staying in the neonatal ward. The predictive value of fecal colonization with P-fimbriated E. coli for the later development of extraintestinal E. coli infections was studied in a 2.5 year prospective study. During this study period there was a baseline incidence rate of 10-20% fecal colonization with P-fimbriated E. coli among the children staying in both the neonatal and maternity wards, interrupted only by minor peaks of colonization with such strains. Length of stay in the neonatal ward and a high bed occupancy of the neonatal ward were statistically correlated to fecal colonization with P-fimbriated E. coli strains (p less than 0.01). During the prospective study there was no difference in the incidence rates of pyelonephritis before the age of one year between the neonatal and maternity ward children. These incidence rates were 0.59% and 0.66%, respectively. Only one of the 113 children from the neonatal ward who were fecally colonized with P-fimbriated E. coli strains later developed pyelonephritis.

A total of 1,530 patients were followed for 3,642 days. Of these patients, 69 developed 80 nosocomial diarrhea episodes after 72 hours in hospital for a nosocomial diarrhea rate of 4.5 infected children per 100 admissions. Of 358 patients with an infected roommate, 37 (10.3%) developed nosocomial diarrhea. Etiologic agents recognized included rotavirus (43%), calicivirus (16%), astrovirus (14%), minreovirus (12%), adenovirus (8%), Salmonella sp. (4%), and parvo/picornavirus (3%). The nosocomial diarrhea rate by age was: 0-11 months, 8.8%; 12-35 months, 3.6%; and 36 months or more, 0.6%. The rate by length of stay was: 3-7 days, 8.4%; 8-14 days, 10.4%; 15-21 days, 7.9%; and 22 days or more, 8.8%, and by number of roommates/1,000 patient-days it was: 0-1, 15.7; 2 to 3, 27.7; and 4 or more, 45.2. Patients who acquired diarrhea were more likely to be diapered (9.6% vs. 1.8%, p less than 0.001). Playroom use was not significantly different in the two groups. A total of 64 patients developed diarrhea within 72 hours of admission (community diarrhea rate = 4.2). Nosocomial viral-associated diarrhea is almost exclusively a disease of diapered children less than age 36 months and occurs at any time during hospital stay. It is more common in multibed rooms, but does occur in single-bed rooms.",
        "contents": "The incidence of viral-associated diarrhea after admission to a pediatric hospital. For determination of the incidence of viral-associated diarrhea after admission to a pediatric hospital, all patients admitted to general pediatrics, cardiology, and neurosurgery wards without diarrhea between January 1 and July 31, 1985 were followed 5 days per week for presence of diarrhea, etiologic agent, and possible risk factors. A total of 1,530 patients were followed for 3,642 days. Of these patients, 69 developed 80 nosocomial diarrhea episodes after 72 hours in hospital for a nosocomial diarrhea rate of 4.5 infected children per 100 admissions. Of 358 patients with an infected roommate, 37 (10.3%) developed nosocomial diarrhea. Etiologic agents recognized included rotavirus (43%), calicivirus (16%), astrovirus (14%), minreovirus (12%), adenovirus (8%), Salmonella sp. (4%), and parvo/picornavirus (3%). The nosocomial diarrhea rate by age was: 0-11 months, 8.8%; 12-35 months, 3.6%; and 36 months or more, 0.6%. The rate by length of stay was: 3-7 days, 8.4%; 8-14 days, 10.4%; 15-21 days, 7.9%; and 22 days or more, 8.8%, and by number of roommates/1,000 patient-days it was: 0-1, 15.7; 2 to 3, 27.7; and 4 or more, 45.2.

The AMU acts as a gateway between a patient's general practitioner, the emergency department, and the wards of the hospital. The AMU helps the emergency department produce a healthy turnaround for patients, helping with the four-hour waiting rule in the United Kingdom. An AMU is usually made up of several bays and has a small number of side-rooms and treatment rooms. They are fully equipped with emergency medical treatment facilities including defibrillators and resuscitation equipment.",

        "content": "The effect of oral premedication was studied in a double-blind, randomised trial of 200 children undergoing day-stay anaesthesia. Midazolam 0.25 mg/kg, midazolam 0.5 mg/kg, diazepam 0.5 mg/kg or a placebo was given orally one hour prior to anaesthesia. Patient state was assessed at nine stages, from administration of the premedication up to and including induction of anaesthesia, using a four-point behavioural scale. Patient state was also assessed postoperatively in the recovery area and the day-stay ward. There was no difference between the four groups until induction of anaesthesia. At this stage 82% of children were either asleep or awake and calm. Patients who received midazolam 0.5 mg/kg were more likely to be asleep or awake and calm at induction rather than other groups (P = 0.05). Children receiving midazolam 0.5 mg/kg or diazepam 0.5 mg/kg slept longest in the post anaesthetic recovery room (P less than 0.005), and spent most time there (P less than .005). There was no difference between groups in the length of time spent in the day-stay ward or in the number of overnight admissions. The study shows that a high proportion of unsedated children are calm at induction of anaesthesia and that oral midazolam is an effective premedication in children for day-stay anaesthesia.",
