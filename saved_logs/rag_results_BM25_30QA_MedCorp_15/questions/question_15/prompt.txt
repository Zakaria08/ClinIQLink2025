Document 1 (Title: Multistrategy health education program to increase mammography use among women ages 65 and older.): Mammography use decreases with age although the risk of breast cancer increases with age. Medicare now provides biennial coverage for screening mammography. This study was designed to simulate the Medicare condition by subsidizing mammography among women in eight retirement communities in the metropolitan Philadelphia area. The study also measured the impact of health education interventions and the presence of a mobile mammography van on increased use of mammography. Retirement communities were assigned randomly to the control (cost subsidy alone) or experimental group (cost subsidy, mammography van, and tailored health education interventions). A total of 412 women ages 65 and older who had not had mammograms in the previous year were surveyed at baseline and 3 months later. Analytic techniques reflected the cluster nature of the randomization. Women in the experimental group were significantly more likely than the control group women to have obtained mammograms. Forty-five percent of the experimental group women compared with 12 percent of the control group women subsequently had mammograms in the 3 months after the baseline interview (P less than .001). Logistic regression analysis for mammography use indicated an odds ratio of 6.1 associated with being in the experimental group. For women in the experimental group, a separate logistic regression for mammography use showed an odds ratio of 7.8 associated with attendance at the educational presentation. The results suggest that Medicare coverage alone will not increase mammography use sufficiently to achieve year 2000 objectives. However, the addition of access enhancing and health education interventions boosts utilization dramatically.
Document 2 (Title: Mammography): Pain The mammography procedure can be painful. Reported pain rates range from 6-76%, with 23-95% experiencing pain or discomfort. Experiencing pain is a significant predictor in women not re-attending screening. There are few proven interventions to reduce pain in mammography, but evidence suggests that giving women information about the mammography procedure prior to it taking place may reduce the pain and discomfort experienced. Furthermore, research has found that standardised compression levels can help to reduce patients' pain while still allowing for optimal diagnostic images to be produced.
Document 3 (Title: Effect of continuing medical education and cost reduction on physician compliance with mammography screening guidelines.): Primary care physicians perform breast cancer screening in women aged 50 years and older less frequently than recommended by national guidelines. A multimethod continuing medical education (CME) intervention was tested in an attempt to increase breast cancer screening practices in a predominantly fee-for-service practice community in New York State. Preintervention and postintervention surveys of primary care physicians were conducted in 1988 and 1990, respectively. Project-initiated, low-cost mammography in one town and the unanticipated provision of free mammography services in another town under nonproject auspices permitted a comparison to be made between these towns and towns where mammography screening was provided at the prevailing fees to determine the impact that cost has on physicians' referral of women patients for mammography. Physicians practicing in the towns in which the CME intervention was provided showed a significant increase, consistent across specialty groups and greatest among family physicians, in the number of reported mammography referrals of asymptomatic women aged 50 to 75 years. Changes in the CME control town were smaller and not statistically significant for the sample size available. The increase in compliance was as large in the CME-intervention towns, one without (19%) and one with low-cost mammography (20%), as the increase in the town with free mammography alone (18%). There were no significant increases in reported performance of breast examination. A multimethod program of CME is a feasible approach to increasing community physician compliance with mammography screening guidelines, particularly among family physicians, and can enhance the impact of reduced cost or have at least the equivalent effect of free mammography services.
Document 4 (Title: Older women's participation in breast screening.): The incidence of breast cancer increases with age, but women's participation in breast screening decreases with age. National and regional surveys indicate a number of barriers. Women over age 65 are more likely to say they have never heard of mammograms, that they did not know they needed them, and that their doctors did not recommend them. In a study conducted at Fox Chase Cancer Center, in Philadelphia, participation in an HMO-sponsored breast screening program appeared to reverse the usual age-related decrease in mammography. If mammography utilization is to increase in women over age 65, physicians must offer unambiguous referrals to older women. In addition, health education interventions are needed to improve knowledge and beliefs of older women and their physicians. And, finally, strategies also are needed to enhance access. With the advent of Medicare coverage, payment will be less of a barrier. But other barriers remain.
Document 5 (Title: Risk factors for breast cancer): There is debate as to whether the higher rate of breast cancer associated with obesity is due to a biological difference in the cancer itself, or differences in other factors such as health screen practices. It has been suggested that obesity may be a determinant for breast cancer screening by mammography. Seventeen scientific studies in the United States have found that as obesity increases in women over 40 years of age the rate of mammography reported decreases significantly. When stratified by race (white vs. black) there was a stronger relationship between obesity and lack of mammography screening among white women. Another study also found lower rates of mammography among those who were overweight and obese compared to those women who were of normal body mass index—this effect was only seen in white women. Obese women are more likely to list pain associated with mammograms as a reason for not getting screened; however, leaner women also list this as a reason for avoiding
Document 6 (Title: Ductal carcinoma in situ): Prognosis With treatment, the prognosis is excellent, with greater than 97% long-term survival. If untreated, DCIS progresses to invasive cancer in roughly one-third of cases, usually in the same breast and quadrant as the earlier DCIS. About 2% of women who are diagnosed with this condition and treated died within 10 years. Biomarkers can identify which women who were initially diagnosed with DCIS are at high or low risk of subsequent invasive cancer. Epidemiology DCIS is often detected with mammographies but can rarely be felt. With the increasing use of screening mammography, noninvasive cancers are more frequently diagnosed and now constitute 15% to 20% of all breast cancers. Cases of DCIS have increased 5 fold between 1983 and 2003 in the United States due to the introduction of screening mammography. In 2009 about 62,000 cases were diagnosed.

Document 7 (Title: Noise-induced hearing loss): A systematic review of the effectiveness of interventions to promote the use of hearing protection devices such as earplugs and earmuffs among workers found that tailored interventions improve the average use of such devices when compared with no intervention. Tailored interventions involve the use of communication or other types of interventions that are specific to an individual or a group and aim to change behavior. Mixed interventions such as mailings, distribution of hearing protection devices, noise assessments, and hearing testing are also more effective in improving the use of hearing protection devices compared with hearing testing alone. Programs that increased the proportion of workers wearing hearing protection equipment did reduce overall hearing loss. Hearing conservation programs
Document 8 (Title: Breast cancer screening): Breast exam Breast examination (either clinical breast exams (CBE) by a health care provider or by self exams) were once widely recommended. They however are not supported by evidence and may, like mammography and other screening methods that produce false positive results, contribute to harm. The use of screening in women without symptoms and at low risk is thus controversial. A 2003 Cochrane review found screening by breast self-examination is not associated with lower death rates among women who report performing breast self-examination and does, like other breast cancer screening methods, increase harms, in terms of increased numbers of benign lesions identified and an increased number of biopsies performed. They conclude "at present, breast self-examination cannot be recommended". There was no high quality evidence looking at clinical breast examination. Mammography
Document 9 (Title: Mammography in a health maintenance organization.): The charts of a random sample of 496 women, aged 51 and older, in a staff model health maintenance organization (HMO) were retrospectively audited for mammography frequency over an 8-year period. Of the 496 women, 306 (61.7%) had at least one mammogram. For the 422 women who had been members of the HMO for at least 2 years, 196 (46.4%) had mammography within the previous 18 months.
Document 10 (Title: Psychological and behavioral implications of abnormal mammograms.): To evaluate women's psychological responses to abnormal mammograms and the effect on mammography adherence. To identify psychological responses and other factors that predict mammography adherence in women with normal or abnormal mammograms. Survey study with prospective analysis of factors associated with mammography adherence. Health Maintenance Organization of Pennsylvania and New Jersey (HMO PA/NJ). Study patients, members of HMO PA/NJ who were 50 years of age or older, and who had had mammography done 3 months earlier, included women with normal mammograms (n = 121), women with low-suspicion mammograms (n = 119), and women with high-suspicion mammograms (n = 68), but not women with breast cancer. Psychological responses 3 months after mammography and adherence to subsequent annual mammography were assessed. Women with high-suspicion mammograms had substantial mammography-related anxiety (47%) and worries about breast cancer (41%). Such worries affected the moods (26%) and daily functioning (17%) of these women, despite diagnostic evaluation excluding malignancy. For each variable, a consistent trend (P greater than 0.05) was seen with degree of mammogram abnormality. Sixty-eight percent of women with normal results, 78% of women with low-suspicion results, and 74% of women with high-suspicion results obtained their subsequent annual mammograms (P greater than 0.05). The number of previous mammograms (odds ratio, 3.2; 95% CI, 1.6 to 6.2) and the effect of the previous results on concerns about breast cancer (odds ratio, 0.5; CI, 0.2 to 1.0) were independent predictors of adherence in logistic regression analyses (P less than 0.05). A substantial proportion of women with suspicious mammograms have psychological difficulties, even after learning that they do not have cancer. Such sequelae do not appear to interfere with subsequent adherence.
Document 11 (Title: Breast cancer screening: effect of physician specialty, practice setting, year of medical school graduation, and sex.): We surveyed physicians of different specialties in a large metropolitan area to determine how their characteristics affected their performance and beliefs about breast cancer screening. Of 664 general internists, obstetrician-gynecologists, and cardiologists surveyed, we received 298 responses (45%). We found significant differences in reported performance of breast cancer screening and physicians' beliefs about mammography screening among practicing obstetrician-gynecologists, internists, and cardiopulmonary specialists. Cardiopulmonary specialists performed the fewest breast examinations and screening mammograms and were most likely to believe annual mammography screening unnecessary even for women in their 50s. We observed no difference between physicians graduating before 1960 and those graduating afterward and no differences according to physician sex. We found similar screening practices and beliefs in the three types of practice settings examined: community-based, private practices, a large health maintenance organization (HMO), and academic medical centers. Obstetrician-gynecologists and internists differed only in the frequency with which they performed breast examinations. Physicians graduating before 1960 in these two groups reported somewhat poorer performance and knowledge of breast cancer screening than those graduating more recently. A majority of all respondents disagreed with American Cancer Society guidelines for mammography screening. Physicians of all specialties reported performing far more breast examinations than screening mammograms on women of all ages, even for those 50-59 years of age. We conclude that all physicians need to improve their screening rates. However, intervention programs should first target those physicians with the greatest deficiencies in breast cancer screening performance and knowledge; these include medical specialists and older physicians in primary care specialties.
Document 12 (Title: Feasibility of universal screening mammography. Lessons from a community intervention.): It is estimated that 44,500 American women will die of breast cancer in 1991. The breast cancer screening guidelines of the American Cancer Society and the National Cancer Institute calling for annual mammography for all women older than 50 years have been endorsed by numerous professional groups. Third-party reimbursement for screening mammography is becoming more prevalent, and payment for screening mammography is now a Medicare benefit. Our studies, conducted as part of a National Cancer Institute grant to increase the routine use of screening mammography and clinical breast examination in women 50 to 75 years of age, have uncovered a number of significant barriers to the implementation of screening guidelines among women, primary care physicians, and providers of mammography services. These barriers, as well as methods to assure the quality of mammography, need to be addressed before universal screening is feasible.
Document 13 (Title: Improving mammography recommendation: a nurse-initiated intervention.): We attempted to improve our compliance with recommendations for screening mammography, according to the American Cancer Society (ACS) guidelines, for eligible women patients seen by family practice residents by using a multipart intervention designed to eliminate identified barriers of knowledge and behavior on the part of the residents. Copies of the ACS cancer screening guidelines were posted in all examination and conference rooms and were provided to all residents. The intervention addressing the behavioral barriers had three components: (1) identification by the nursing staff of eligible women who were overdue for a mammogram as they presented for care, (2) completion of a checklist by residents indicating whether a mammogram was or was not recommended and why, and (3) a nurse-initiated backup reminder system for patients who escaped the primary checklist system. An audit of 200 preintervention and 270 postintervention charts showed statistically and clinically significant increases in mammograms recommended or done. Similar statistically significant increases were found in a cohort of 111 charts of patients in both the pre- and the postintervention audits. Results indicate that an intervention designed to eliminate identified resident-dependent barriers to compliance with screening mammography guidelines can be effective in increasing recommended mammography rates.
Document 14 (Title: Interval adherence to mammography screening guidelines.): The objectives of this research were to document adherence to mammography screening guidelines among women over 50 years of age and to investigate factors related to adherence. Selected sociodemographic variables--personal breast health history, provider-related variables, and medical care utilization--were studied. Data were collected through a random digit dial telephone survey of 693 women from two geographic areas. While 48% had had a mammogram in the last year, only 20% reported at least two recent mammograms at yearly intervals. Adherence was significantly associated with having a higher income, being white, being 51 to 64 years old and having had breast symptoms and/or a family history of breast cancer. Additionally, women who had a regular physician, higher frequency of clinical breast examination, and a recent physician visit were more adherent. Women enrolled in Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs) and/or covered by commercial plans were more adherent than women with no insurance or with entitlement coverage only. These relationships were generally maintained in multivariate analysis. While this study is consistent with others that demonstrate increasing adoption of mammographic screening, it also illustrates that the goal of regular screening according to guidelines has yet to be achieved.
Document 15 (Title: How valid are mammography self-reports?): We compared mammography reports in medical records to self-reports obtained during a 1989 telephone interview survey for a sample of 100 women members of a health maintenance organization (HMO) who indicated they had mammograms within the past year and 100 who said they had not had mammograms within the past year. Of the women reporting they had not had mammograms within the past year, none had mammogram reports in the HMO data center. Of the 100 women reporting they had mammograms within the past year, 94 had confirmatory radiology records.
