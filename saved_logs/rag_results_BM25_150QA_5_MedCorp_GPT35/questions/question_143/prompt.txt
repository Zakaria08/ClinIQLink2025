Document 1 (Title: Quinidine -- Administration -- Dosage Regimens): Oral immediate-release formulation: The initial therapy involves administering 2 tablets of 200 mg each every 6 hours to the patients. The dose may be cautiously increased if the desired pharmacological conversion is not achieved after 4 to 5 doses. Oral extended-release formulation: For the first treatment option, patients are administered 2 tablets of 324 mg each (equivalent to 403 mg of quinidine base) every 8 hours. If the desired pharmacological conversion is not achieved after 3 or 4 doses, the dose may be increased cautiously. As an alternative regimen, patients may have been prescribed 1 tablet (equivalent to 202 mg of quinidine base) every 8 hours for 2 days, followed by 2 tablets (equivalent to 403 mg of quinidine base) every 12 hours for 2 days, and, finally, 2 tablets (equivalent to 403 mg of quinidine base) every 8 hours for up to 4 days. For the final 4-day treatment plan, the lower dose may be opted at the physician's discretion.
Document 2 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): in a sustained-release capsule that dissolves within the small intestine at a pH of 6. Lansoprazole is available in an orally disintegrating tablet that can be taken with or without water, an advantage for individuals who have significant dysphagia. Absorption kinetics are similar to the capsule. In addition, a lansoprazole-naproxen combination preparation that has been made available is targeted at decreasing NSAID-related GI injury (see below). Omeprazole is available as nonenteric-coated granules mixed with sodium bicarbonate in a powder form that can be administered orally or via gastric tube. The sodium bicarbonate has two purposes: to protect the omeprazole from acid degradation and to promote rapid gastric alkalinization and subsequent proton pump activation, which facilitates rapid action of the PPI. Pantoprazole and rabeprazole are available as enteric-coated tablets. Pantoprazole is also available as a parenteral formulation for intravenous use. These agents are lipophilic
Document 3 (Title: Pharmaceutical formulation): Sustained release There are a number of methods by which tablets and capsules can be modified in order to allow for sustained release of the active compound as it moves through the digestive tract. One of the most common methods is to embed the active ingredient in an insoluble porous matrix, such that the dissolving drug must make its way out of the matrix before it can be absorbed. In other sustained release formulations the matrix swells to form a gel through which the drug exits. Another method by which sustained release is achieved is through an osmotic controlled-release oral delivery system, where the active compound is encased in a water-permeable membrane with a laser drilled hole at one end. As water passes through the membrane the drug is pushed out through the hole and into the digestive tract where it can be absorbed. Parenteral formulations
Document 4 (Title: [Enhanced bioavailability of digoxin from silica matrix formulations (author's transl)].): The bioavailability of digoxin from 3 silica matrix formulations was assessed in single-dose crossover studies in 12 healthy human volunteers: digoxin/silica matrix tablets (I, Digacin), digoxin/silica matrix in capsule form (II) and digoxin/silica matrix dragées, protected against gastrict juice by film coating (III). Urinary glycoside excretion for 6 days after 0.5 mg doses were measured by radioimmunoasay. Referring to an intravenous injection the bioavailability of digoxin from Digacin tablets is 82%, from the encapsulated matrix 69%, and from the dragées 54%. In comparison with corresponding results from other investigators Digacin tablets havet the same high bioavailability as digoxin solutions. In vitro liberations of digoxin from the silica matrix formulations (94% in 90 s) is significantly better than from conventional tablets produces from a digoxin-lactose trituration (61% in 90 s).
Document 5 (Title: [Prolongation of theophylline derivative release with cellulose acetate based tablets].): Sustained-release tablets were prepared with three theophylline compounds of increasing solubility: theophylline, dyphylline and proxyphylline. Cellulose acetate was used as the matrix polymer. Two formulation parameters were studied: incorporated theophylline dose and percentage of polymer constituting the matrix. Drug release was enhanced as these parameter values rose. A mixed mineral and plastic matrix was formed by the two insoluble excipients, i.e. cellulose acetate and dibasic calcium phosphate for direct compression. Drug release could be optimized either by 2(2) factorial analysis or by multiple linear regression. Drug solubility was found to have an especially important influence on the release and did not allow sustained-release tablets to be obtained when it was too great. In the case of dyphylline and proxyphylline, only the additional application of a barrier-coating over the surface of the matrix tablets enabled prevention of their premature erosion and the massive release of drugs.
