Document 1 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): 982 Listeria monocytogenes Infections Elizabeth L. Hohmann, Daniel A. Portnoy Listeria monocytogenes is a food-borne pathogen that can cause serious infections, particularly in pregnant women and immunocompromised 176 individuals. A ubiquitous saprophytic environmental bacterium, L. monocytogenes is also a facultative intracellular pathogen with a broad host range. Humans are probably accidental hosts for this microorganism. L. monocytogenes is of interest not only to clinicians but also to basic scientists as a model intracellular pathogen that is used to study basic mechanisms of microbial pathogenesis and host immunity. L. monocytogenes is a facultatively anaerobic, nonsporulating, gram-positive rod that grows over a broad temperature range, including refrigeration temperatures. This organism is motile during growth at low temperatures but much less so at 37°C. The vast majority of cases of human listerial disease can be traced to serotypes 1/2a, 1/2b, and 4.
Document 2 (Title: Mesophile): Examples Some notable mesophiles include Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli. Other examples of species of mesophiles are Clostridium kluyveri, Pseudomonas maltophilia, Thiobacillus novellus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Different types of diseases and infections typically have pathogens from mesophilic bacteria such as the ones listed above. Listeria monocytogenes Listeria monocytogenes is a gram-positive bacterium. It is closely related to Bacillus and Staphylococcus. It is a rod-shaped, facultative anaerobe that is motile by peritrichous flagella. L. monocytogenes motility is limited from 20 °C to 25 °C. At the optimal temperature, it loses its motility. This bacterium is responsible for listeriosis which derives from contaminated food.
Document 3 (Title: Listeria monocytogenes activation of human peripheral blood lymphocytes: induction of non-major histocompatibility complex-restricted cytotoxic activity and cytokine production.): Gram-negative bacteria have been shown to activate human natural killer (NK) cells. In this report, we show that the gram-positive bacterium Listeria monocytogenes can also activate human NK cells with regard to non-major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-restricted killing and the production of cytokines. Overnight incubation of peripheral blood mononuclear (PBM) cells or enriched NK cell populations with live or Formalin-fixed L. monocytogenes resulted in high levels of non-MHC-restricted cytotoxic activity. Listeria-stimulated non-MHC-restricted cytotoxic activity could be achieved with pathogenic as well as nonpathogenic Listeria strains. PBM cells also produced tumor necrosis factor alpha and different interferons (IFNs) after incubation with Listeria strains. Optimal cytokine production appeared to be dependent on nylon wool- and plastic-adherent cells. Different IFNs were produced by Listeria-stimulated PBM cells obtained from different donors. IFN-gamma was always produced but was sometimes associated with IFN-alpha and/or IFN-beta. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) activity was never detected in culture supernatants obtained from Listeria-stimulated PBM cell cultures. However, IL-2 appeared to be produced by Listeria-stimulated PBM cells, since antibody to IL-2 inhibited Listeria-stimulated NK cell cytotoxic activity. Listeria activation of NK cell cytotoxic activity was also dependent on tumor necrosis factor alpha production. Antibody to IFN-gamma, IFN-beta, or IFN-alpha had no effect on Listeria-stimulated NK cell cytotoxic activity. These results demonstrate that NK cells can be activated by Listeria strains and add further evidence that NK cells may play an important role in host defense against bacterial infections.
Document 4 (Title: Ampicillin -- Indications -- FDA-approved Indications): Respiratory tract infection: caused by: Streptococcus pneumoniae , penicillinase, and non-penicillinase-producing Staphylococcus aureus , group A beta-hemolytic Streptococci, Hemophilus influenzae . Bacterial meningitis: caused by Gram-negative bacteria: Neisseria meningitis , Escherichia coli , Gram-positive bacteria: Listeria monocytogenes, Group B Streptococci . Adding aminoglycosides increases its effectiveness against gram-negative bacteria. [2] Septicemia and endocarditis: caused by Gram-positive bacteria, including penicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus species , Streptococcus species , and Enterococcus species. Gram-negative bacteria include Escherichia coli , Salmonella species , and Proteus mirabilis . Endocarditis caused by enterococci usually responds to intravenous ampicillin. Adding aminoglycosides with ampicillin may increase its effectiveness when treating endocarditis caused by streptococci. [3]
Document 5 (Title: Neonatal Meningitis -- Etiology -- Bacterial and Fungal Etiologies): The incidence of early-onset meningitis has been greatly reduced by using intrapartum antibiotics for GBS infection. However, GBS remains the most common cause of meningitis and neonatal sepsis, responsible for more than 40% of all early-onset infections. [3] [4] [5] The next most common pathogen, Escherichia coli, accounts  for approximately 30% of all early-onset neonatal meningitis and is documented as the most common cause of early-onset sepsis and meningitis among VLBW and preterm newborns. [2] [6] Listeria monocytogenes, Enterococcus sp, and S treptococcus pneumoniae are the other major pathogens causing early-onset bacterial meningitis in neonates. [2] [7]
