Diagnosis Diagnosis is first suspected clinically based on history and physical exam and usually confirmed by an MRI scan or CT scan, depending on availability. Bladder scanning and loss of catheter sensation can also be used to evaluate bladder dysfunction in suspected cases of cauda equina syndrome and can aid diagnosis before MRI scanning. Early surgery in acute onset of severe cases has been reported to be important. Prevention Early diagnosis of cauda equina syndrome can allow for preventive treatment. Signs that allow early diagnosis include changes in bowel and bladder function and loss of feeling in groin. Changes in sensation can start as pins and needles leading to numbness. Changes in bladder function may be changes to stream or inability to fully empty the bladder. If a person progresses to full retention intervention is less likely to be successful.",

        "title": "Male Urinary Retention: Acute and Chronic -- Treatment / Management -- Cauda equina syndrome",
        "content": "The syndrome is caused by damage or compression of the spinal nerve roots from L1 to L5, especially L3 to L5. The most common cause (45%) is a herniated intervertebral disc.\u00a0Other etiologies include spinal hematomas, diskitis, primary or metastatic spinal neoplasms, epidural abscess, trauma, aortic obstruction, and spinal stenosis. [65] The incidence is very low at an estimated 1:30,000 to 1:100,000 population. [66] Typical symptoms include back pain, sciatica, neuropathy or weakness of the lower extremities, saddle anesthesia, urinary retention, and bowel dysfunction.\u00a0The syndrome should be suspected whenever urinary retention is associated with unexplained bowel dysfunction. The risk increases with decreased rectal tone, saddle anesthesia, or back pain. MRI makes the diagnosis. Immediate surgical correction can help minimize long-term complications, but this requires early clinical suspicion and proper imaging. Unfortunately, almost half of these patients (47.7%) develop long-term urinary retention, usually managed with intermittent self-catheterization after corrective surgery.

        "content": "A 41-year-old man was doing well until July 1989, when he noted numbness over soles, followed 4 months later by difficulty in walking. These symptoms were progressively getting worse, and he was admitted to our department on June 12, 1990. General physical examination was unremarkable. Neurologically cranial nerves were intact except old right, traumatic strabismus. Muscle tone and deep tendon reflexes were normal throughout, but bilateral Babinski and Chaddock reflexes were present. Mild weakness of lower extremities were found on muscle testing (4/5). In sensory system, superficial sensory disturbance below T10 was seen, and markedly diminished vibration and position senses of lower extremities were noted. Cerebellar test was intact, although unsteadiness was found on heel-shin test. Romberg sign was definitely positive. His gait was wide-based and ataxic. Laboratory data showed no abnormalities in CBC, chemistry, urinalysis, serological tests and endocrinological examinations. Spinal MRI (Siemens 1.5 Tesla) showed abnormal deposition of epidural fatty tissues compressing spinal cord with flattening of cord from T4 to T8. Spinal ataxia as compressive myelopathy due to epidural lipomatosis was considered and he underwent laminectomy from T4 to T8 with improvement in walking. Epidural lipomatosis is an unusual cause of spinal cord compression, presenting compressive myelopathy, radiculopathy, cauda equina syndrome, intermittent claudication, or back pain. Most of cases were associated with long-term administration of adrenocortical steroid hormone, or underlying diseases, except only 3 cases including ours. This is the first case of spinal epidural lipomatosis presenting progressive gait disturbance due to spinal ataxia.",
