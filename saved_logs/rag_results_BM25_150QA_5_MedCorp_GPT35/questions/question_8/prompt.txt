Document 1 (Title: Pyloric stenosis): Cause Rarely, infantile pyloric stenosis can occur as an autosomal dominant condition. It is uncertain whether it is a congenital anatomic narrowing or a functional hypertrophy of the pyloric sphincter muscle. Pathophysiology The gastric outlet obstruction due to the hypertrophic pylorus impairs emptying of gastric contents into the duodenum. As a consequence, all ingested food and gastric secretions can only exit via vomiting, which can be of a projectile nature. While the exact cause of the hypertrophy remains unknown, one study suggested that neonatal hyperacidity may be involved in the pathogenesis. This physiological explanation for the development of clinical pyloric stenosis at around 4 weeks and its spontaneous long term cure without surgery if treated conservatively, has recently been further reviewed.
Document 2 (Title: First_Aid_Step1): Abdominal structures enter the thorax A ; may occur due to congenital defect of pleuroperitoneal membrane or from trauma. Commonly occurs on left side due to relative protection of right hemidiaphragm by liver. Most commonly a hiatal hernia, in which stomach herniates upward through the esophageal hiatus of the diaphragm. Sliding hiatal hernia—gastroesophageal junction is displaced upward as gastric cardia slides into hiatus; “hourglass stomach.” Most gastric fundus common type. Associated with GERD. Paraesophageal hiatal hernia— gastroesophageal junction is usually normal but gastric fundus protrudes into the thorax. Goes through the internal (deep) inguinal ring, external (superficial) inguinal ring, and into the groin. Enters internal inguinal ring lateral to inferior epigastric vessels. Caused by failure of processus vaginalis to close (can form hydrocele). May be noticed in infants or discovered in adulthood. Much more common in males B .
Document 3 (Title: Cesarean section does not improve outcome in gastroschisis.): Elective cesarean section (CS) following prenatal diagnosis of gastroschisis has been advocated to decrease morbidity and mortality. To examine this hypothesis, we reviewed the records of 28 consecutive patients with gastroschisis treated between 1975 and 1987. Fourteen infants were delivered vaginally (V) and fourteen by CS, of which seven were elective, five were for fetal distress, and two were for breech presentation. Prenatal diagnosis was made in nine infants in the CS group and none in the vaginal group. The two groups were comparable in gestational age (V = 37.6 weeks, CS = 35.8 weeks, P = .05), birth weight (V = 2,508 g, CS = 2,444 g, P = NS), and five-minute Apgar score (V = 7.8, CS = 6.8, P = NS). Outcome was similar as measured by hospital mortality (V = 0/14, CS = 1/14, P = NS), complications (V = 4/14, CS = 5/14, P = NS), days to enteral feeding (V = 14, CS = 19, P = NS), and days in the hospital (V = 27, CS = 34, P = NS). The only complication related to mode of delivery was preventable; an infant delivered vaginally had avulsion of a short segment of mesentery requiring bowel resection. Infants born by CS were slightly more likely to have primary closure (5/14) than babies delivered vaginally (3/14, P = NS), but this may reflect independent trends in the last 5 years. Elective CS following prenatal diagnosis in seven patients did not improve outcome; primary closure was achieved in only one infant, and three had a complication. Since these data show no significant difference in morbidity and mortality between vaginal and CS delivery, we suggest that CS should not be recommended simply because a prenatal diagnosis of gastroschisis is made.
Document 4 (Title: Gastroschisis -- Treatment / Management -- Delivery): Infants with gastroschisis have no contraindication to vaginal delivery based on gastroschisis alone. The timing of delivery is based on gestation age (lung maturity), ultrasound findings (fetal growth profile, bowel appearance), and fetal testing results. Care for the infant is usually managed by a group of specialists, including a maternal-fetal medicine specialist, neonatologist, and pediatric surgery, to discuss patient-specific factors before delivery. The mean gestational age for spontaneous delivery in women carrying infants with gastroschisis is the 36th week of gestation. [17] [18] A survey of practice patterns demonstrated forty percent of maternal-fetal medicine specialists deliver infants at 37 weeks, 30 percent deliver at 39 weeks if gastroschisis is stable. The remainder delivers infants before 37 weeks. [13] Overall, many maternal-medicine specialists allow a trial of vaginal delivery. When there is marked liver herniation, a cesarean section should be considered. One factor that some specialists utilize to determine continued gestation is if the bowel does not dilate greater than 25 mm after 37 weeks gestation.
Document 5 (Title: Gastroschisis -- Introduction): Gastroschisis is a paraumbilical, full-thickness abdominal wall defect associated with protrusion of the bowel through the defect. It is rarely associated with genetic conditions. A membrane does not cover the bowel exposed in utero and, as a result, may be matted, dilated, and covered with a fibrinous inflammatory rind. Infants have a high proportion of intrauterine growth restriction. Diagnosis is often made on the 20-week ultrasound with free-floating bowel loops in the uterine cavity. Maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is elevated in pregnancies with gastroschisis. Compared with other abdominal wall defects diagnosed prenatally, such as omphalocele, only 10 percent of cases with gastroschisis are associated with malformations outside of the gastrointestinal tract. Additional gastrointestinal problems occur in up to a quarter of cases. Infants can be classified and simple or complex, which can help stratify outcomes and care for infants born with gastroschisis. Complexity is based on the absence or presence of intestinal atresia, stenosis, bowel perforation, necrosis, malrotation, or volvulus. Infants may benefit from delivery in a facility with resources such as high-risk obstetrics, neonatology, and neonatal intensive care unit, and a pediatric surgeon—a trial of labor rather than scheduled cesarean birth for most patients. Spontaneous delivery usually occurs between 37 to 38 weeks gestation. A trial of spontaneous vaginal delivery is supported. The exposed infant bowel is protected following birth, an orogastric tube is placed, as are peripheral IVs. The airway is stabilized. Gastroschisis closure can be performed operatively or through slow bowel reductions utilizing a spring-loaded silo to contain the bowel. While a small percentage of infants have intestinal atresia, bowel loss, and prolonged hospitalizations, the overall survival is greater than 90%. [1]

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
Question: A 3900-g (8.6-lb) male infant is delivered at 39 weeks' gestation via spontaneous vaginal delivery. Pregnancy and delivery were uncomplicated but a prenatal ultrasound at 20 weeks showed a defect in the pleuroperitoneal membrane. Further evaluation of this patient is most likely to show which of the following findings?
Options:
A. Gastric fundus in the thorax
B. Pancreatic ring around the duodenum
C. Hypertrophy of the gastric pylorus
D. Large bowel in the inguinal canal
