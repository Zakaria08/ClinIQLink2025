Document 1 (Title: [Child abuse: report of three cases].): Child abuse, a clinical condition in young children who have received serious physical abuse, is a frequent cause of permanent injury or death. The first case is a 7-year-old boy suffering from abdominal distension and pain for 3 days. He was beaten by his mother as a result of inadequately learning his lessons. Sonogram and CT of the abdomen showed massive ascites and a pseudocyst of the pancreatic body about 3 x 3 cm in diameter. The second case is a 4-year-old girl who developed a semicomatose state after her father impulsively struck her with a chair. CT of the brain revealed subdural hematoma over the left fronto-temporal region and midline shift to the right. She expired 5 days later. The third case, a 2-year-old girl, suffered from headache, seizure, vomiting and general malaise. CT of the brain showed severe brain swelling over the right side and midline shift to the left. She expired 1 month later. Psychiatric factors are probably of prime importance in the pathogenesis of the disorder, but our knowledge of these factors is limited. Parents who inflict abuse on children do not necessarily have psychopathic or sociopathic personalities or come from borderline socioeconomic groups, although most published cases fall into one of these categories. It is clearly the responsibility of all physicians serving children to be aware of, to recognize, and to properly manage any child who has been the victim of abuse.
Document 2 (Title: Biochemistry_Lippinco): B. in eukaryotes requires condensation of chromatin. C. in prokaryotes is accomplished by a single DNA polymerase. D. is initiated at random sites in the genome. E. produces a polymer of deoxyribonucleoside monophosphates linked by 5′→3′-phosphodiester bonds. . What is the difference between DNA proofreading and repair? Case 6: Dark Urine and Yellow Sclerae Patient Presentation: JF is a 13-year-old boy who presents with fatigue and yellow sclerae. Focused History: JF began treatment ~4 days ago with a sulfonamide antibiotic and a urinary analgesic for a urinary tract infection. He had been told that his urine would change color (become reddish) with the analgesic, but he reports that it has gotten darker (more brownish) over the last 2 days. Last night, his mother noticed that his eyes had a yellow tint. JF says he feels as though he has no energy.
Document 3 (Title: Annular pancreas): Causes It is typically associated with abnormal embryological development, however adult cases can develop. It can result from growth of a bifid ventral pancreatic bud around the duodenum, where the parts of the bifid ventral bud fuse with the dorsal bud, forming a pancreatic ring. It can also result if the ventral pancreatic bud fails to fully rotate, so it remains on the right or if the dorsal bud rotates in the wrong direction, such that the duodenum is surrounded by pancreatic tissue. Blockage of the duodenum develops if inflammation (pancreatitis) develops in the annular pancreas.
Document 4 (Title: 38-Year-Old Male Presents With Lower Extremity Edema -- Case Presentation): His physical exam revealed clear lungs and a normal heart exam on auscultation. His abdomen was soft and non-tender, and his skin was warm and dry with no rash. He had 2 plus pitting edema at the ankles. Initial laboratory data was consistent with acute kidney injury (AKI) with worsening creatinine from 1.2 to 1.6 over 1 month and nephrotic range proteinuria. Serologies for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, anti-nuclear antibody (ANA), c-ANCA, serine protease 3 (PR3) IgG, myeloperoxidase antibody (MPO), and complement levels were sent. He was started on losartan for proteinuria with plans for renal biopsy; however, he was lost to follow up. The patient then presented two weeks later with worsening edema to his waist, continued weight gain, mild hemoptysis, and streaks of blood in the stool. Physical examination now showed worsening pitting edema up to his waist with new non-pruritic, erythematous excoriations on the medial aspect of his thighs bilaterally. He was admitted to the hospital with concern for worsening vasculitis. He was started on oral prednisone and underwent a renal biopsy. For his edema, he was started on diuretics to which he responded well. Due to persistent leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing was performed to complete the workup.
Document 5 (Title: Pennsylvania Child Abuse Recognition and Reporting -- Pearls and Other Issues -- A 13-year-old girl is brought to her pediatrician because of a recent decline in her grades. During a private interview, she admits she has "problems with boys at school" and "bad dreams about boys always staring at her." The child privately admits she regularly gets up in the middle of the night and sleeps with the biological mother on her side of the bed, with her stepfather next to her mother. The child indicates the stepfather has commented that she is a "looker," has "big headlights," and needs to "fend off the boys at school." The pediatrician attended high school with the stepfather and knows he is not the "brightest bulb" but seems to care about the child genuinely. The child indicates the stepfather wears pajamas, has never touched her, and always knocks before entering the bathroom or her room. She says she is very anxious about attending school and is afraid to speak with her mother about her school problems. She says her stepfather has always been "very good" to her mother and is always kind and considerate to her as well. She does not want to get him into trouble but feels his comments about her appearance add to her anxiety. What should the pediatrician do in this situation?): Given the totality of the circumstances, there may not be reasonable cause to suspect child abuse; however, there remain numerous concerns, such as the child's problems at school, nightmares, child co-sleeping at the age of 13, and the stepfather's inappropriate comments to the child. General concerns for a child's safety, health, and well-being may be reported to ChildLine for assessment of services and support. The PA CPSL prescribes that a person, hospital, institution, school, facility, agency, or agency employee acting in good faith shall have immunity from civil and criminal liability that might otherwise result from making a report of suspected child abuse or making a referral for general protective services, regardless of whether the report is required to be made under the PA CPSL.

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
Question: A mother brings her 3-week-old infant to the pediatrician's office because she is concerned about his feeding habits. He was born without complications and has not had any medical problems up until this time. However, for the past 4 days, he has been fussy, is regurgitating all of his feeds, and his vomit is yellow in color. On physical exam, the child's abdomen is minimally distended but no other abnormalities are appreciated. Which of the following embryologic errors could account for this presentation?
Options:
A. Abnormal migration of ventral pancreatic bud
B. Complete failure of proximal duodenum to recanalize
C. Abnormal hypertrophy of the pylorus
D. Failure of lateral body folds to move ventrally and fuse in the midline
