Special consideration should be paid to puncture wounds in areas like the hands, which have multiple small compartments. Some groups have found that as long as wounds are properly irrigated and cleansed with povidone iodine solution while a short course of antibiotics is prescribed, there is no difference in infection rates in dog bite wounds closed primarily.62Rabies in domestic animals in the United States is rare, and most cases are contracted from bat bites. In developing countries, dog bites remain the most common source of rabies. Management of this is beyond the scope of this
Document 2 (Title: Asplenia): Additional measures Surgical and dental procedures - Antibiotic prophylaxis may be required before certain surgical or dental procedures. Animal bites - adequate antibiotic cover is required after even minor dog or other animal bites. Asplenic patients are particularly susceptible to infection by capnocytophaga canimorsus and should receive a five-day course of amoxicillin/clavulanate (erythromycin in patients allergic to penicillin). Tick bites - Babesiosis is a rare tickborne infection. Patients should check themselves or have themselves inspected for tick bites if they are in an at-risk situation. Presentation with fever, fatigue, and haemolytic anaemia requires diagnostic confirmation by identifying the parasites within red blood cells on blood film and by specific serology. Quinine (with or without clindamycin) is usually an effective treatment.
Document 3 (Title: Animal Bites -- Treatment / Management): All wounds require extensive irrigation. Provide appropriate pain management before exploration, irrigation, or debridement of the wounds. The patient’s tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis status should be updated if necessary. For uncomplicated dog bites, the patient should be educated on the risk/benefit of closure versus healing by secondary intention and the decision made with the provider. If the patient presents delayed from the initial bite, the risks of closing the wound almost certainly outweigh the cosmetic benefits of closure. If the wound is closed, the patient should be discharged with a week’s course of amoxicillin-clavulanate.
Document 4 (Title: Cutaneous nocardiosis associated with insect bites.): We report the first case of cutaneous nocardiosis associated with insect bites. The patient received these insect bites while camping a few days before he presented to the emergency room. The patient was a healthy twenty-six-year-old man, who was asplenic as a result of a motor vehicle accident. He presented to the emergency room with fever, multiple insect bites to his left lower extremity with pustules, lymphangitis, and left inguinal adenopathy. He was hospitalized but his condition failed to improve despite treatment with intravenous nafcillin for three days. Wound and blood cultures subsequently grew Nocardia brasiliensis. Treatment with intravenous amikacin (5 mg/kg every eight hours) was instituted along with oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole double strength twice a day. The patient recovered with minimal scarring of the extremity. The amikacin was stopped after seven days and the patient was discharged to receive oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. This disease should be kept in mind when cutaneous infections do not respond to standard antibiotics, especially in the southwestern United States.
Document 5 (Title: Animal Bites -- Treatment / Management): Complicated dog bites should be stabilized and referred for the appropriate consultation service. Cat bites deeper than superficial, so thorough irrigation under local anesthesia is needed, and the wound is left open. The patient should be discharged with a week of amoxicillin-clavulanate and given strict wound care precautions. All bites to the hands or feet, bites in immunocompromised individuals, bites that already show signs of infection, and bites with a puncture characteristic require treatment with amoxicillin-clavulanate. Second-line therapy for patients with penicillin allergies is doxycycline or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) plus metronidazole or clindamycin. The appropriate consult service should see patients with extensive local infection; patients with evidence of disseminated infection should be treated with broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics and admitted for further care.

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
Question: A 27-year-old man presents to the emergency department after a dog bite. The patient was intoxicated and pulled the dog’s tail while it was eating. The dog belongs to his friend and is back at his friend’s house currently. Physical exam is notable for a dog bite on the patient’s right arm. The wound is irrigated and explored with no retained bodies found. A tetanus vaccination is administered. Which of the following is appropriate management of this patient?
Options:
A. Administer amoxicillin-clavulanic acid
B. Administer trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole
C. Close the wound with sutures and discharge the patient
D. Discharge the patient with outpatient follow up
