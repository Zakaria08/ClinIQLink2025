        "title": "[Detection of immune complexes in the sera and around the muscle fibers in a case of myasthenia gravis and polymyositis].",
        "content": "A case of myasthenia gravis accompanied with polymyositis and malignant thymoma, detected immune complexes in the sera and around the muscle fibers, was described. A 37-year-old woman was admitted to Shinshu University Hospital in September, 1987 because of dyspnea, dysphagia and muscle weakness. She first noticed her right blepharoptosis 3 weeks before admission. Weakness of all four limbs and myalgia of lower extremities were noticed one week later. These symptoms got worse and nocturnal dyspnea, dysphagia and easy fatigability at mastication appeared. On admission, she looked ill and neurological examination revealed left blepharoptosis, bilateral facial weakness, weakness of all four limbs, more prominent in proximal muscles and tenderness of lower extremities. Edrophonium test was positive, improving her muscle weakness. Laboratory examination revealed the elevated serum levels of CK, the increased titre of circulating immune complexes and high titres of acetylcholine receptor antibodies and anti-skeletal muscle antibodies. Electromyographic study showed myogenic pattern and Harvey-Masland test revealed waning at low frequency stimulation. Muscle biopsy showed marked perivascular infiltration of lymphocytes, accompanied by phagocytosis and interstitial fibrosis. IgG deposits were shown around the muscle fibers exclusively around the infiltrates of mononuclear cells. Granular deposits of C3 were also shown specifically around the muscle fibers exclusively around the infiltrates of mononuclear cells. Thymectomy was performed on September 21, 1987. Invasion of thymoma, predominantly lymphocytic type, to right lung and pericardium was observed histologically. After thymectomy, she got better. Immunological data and immunohistochemical examination of the present case suggest that in the case of myasthenia gravis accompanied with polymyositis and malignant thymoma, immune complexes may play a primary role on the pathogenesis of myositis.",

        "title": "Lambert\u2013Eaton myasthenic syndrome",
        "content": "Signs and symptoms The weakness from LEMS typically involves the muscles of the proximal arms and legs (the muscles closer to the trunk). In contrast to myasthenia gravis, the weakness affects the legs more than the arms. This leads to difficulties climbing stairs and rising from a sitting position. Weakness is often relieved temporarily after exertion or physical exercise. High temperatures can worsen the symptoms. Weakness of the bulbar muscles (muscles of the mouth and throat) is occasionally encountered. Weakness of the eye muscles is uncommon. Some may have double vision, drooping of the eyelids and difficulty swallowing, but generally only together with leg weakness; this too distinguishes LEMS from myasthenia gravis, in which eye signs are much more common. In the advanced stages of the disease, weakness of the respiratory muscles may occur. Some may also experience problems with coordination (ataxia).",

Katzung, MD, PhD A 56-year-old woman is brought to the university eye center with a complaint of \u201closs of vision.\u201d Because of visual impair-ment, she has lost her driver\u2019s license and has fallen several times in her home. Examination reveals that her eyelids close involuntarily with a frequency and duration sufficient to pre-vent her from seeing her surroundings for more than brief moments at a time. When she holds her eyelids open with her fingers, she can see normally. She has no other muscle dysfunction. A diagnosis of blepharospasm is made. Using a fine needle, several injections of botulinum toxin type A are made in the orbicularis oculi muscle of each eyelid. After observation in the waiting area, she is sent home. Two days later, she reports by telephone that her vision has improved dramatically. How did botulinum toxin improve her vision? How long can her vision be expected to remain normal after this single treatment?",

She was found to have ulcers of the cervix and vaginal vault with areas of necrosis. Donovan bodies were found in the ulcer smears. She was initially treated with streptomycin, then switched to tetracycline when she could not tolerate the side effects of the first medication. She was noted to significantly improve with decreased ulcer size and less discharge after 20 days of treatment. Two months after treatment, she reported a complete resolution of her symptoms and was noted to be symptom-free after 1 year.",
