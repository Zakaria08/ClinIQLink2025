Document 1 (Title: First_Aid_Step1): Upper motor neuron = everything up (tone, Reflexes • DTRs, toes) Tone • Fasciculations = muscle twitching Babinski +− Positive Babinski is normal in infants Poliomyelitis Caused by poliovirus (fecal-oral transmission). Replicates in oropharynx and small intestine before spreading via bloodstream to CNS. Infection causes destruction of cells in anterior horn of spinal cord (LMN death). Signs of LMN lesion: asymmetric weakness (vs symmetric weakness in spinal muscular atrophy), hypotonia, flaccid paralysis, fasciculations, hyporeflexia, muscle atrophy. Respiratory muscle involvement leads to respiratory failure. Signs of infection: malaise, headache, fever, nausea, etc. CSF shows  WBCs (lymphocytic pleocytosis) and slight  of protein (with no change in CSF glucose). Virus recovered from stool or throat.
Document 2 (Title: Radiculomyelitis following acute haemorrhagic conjunctivitis.): The clinical manifestations and natural history of radiculomyelitis following a newly reported disease--acute haemorrhagic conjunctivitis (AHC)--have been studied in 33 patients in Taiwan, and the following observations made: All the patients in this series were adults at ages ranging from 21 to 55 years; the salient initial neurological manifestations were radicular pains and acute flaccid paralysis which developed from five to thirty-seven days after the onset of AHC. In some patients, signs and symptoms indicating involvement of the meninges, cranial nerves and the white matter of the cord were observed; motor paralysis was the most striking feature during the whole clinical course; it consisted of flaccid asymmetrical weakness in one or more limbs, usually being more severe in the lower limbs than in the upper, and often more proximal than distal. Atrophy in the severely affected muscles usually became apparent in the second or third week of the weakness; the prognosis regarding the return of function in the affected muscles was dependent on the severity of the involvement. Permanent incapacitation due to paralysis and muscular atrophy in the affected proximal muscles of lower limbs was the main sequel in severe cases. The pattern and prognosis of flaccid motor paralysis were reminiscent of acute poliomyelitis in which the anterior horn cells of the spinal cord are mainly involved. Pleocytosis ranging from 11 to 270 per mm3 was noted in the majority of the patients when the cerebrospinal fluid was examined within the first three weeks from the onset of neurological symptoms; the total protein level was raised invariably from the second week onwards in all specimens, and remained so throughout the subsequent course as long as the seventh week or later. Tissue culture neutralization tests were performed on the sera from 9 patients; significant rises in the antibody titres (greater than or equal to 1:16) to AHC virus antigens were found in 8 cases, and in 2 of them a fourfold rise in the paired sera was noted. The differentiation of this syndrome from poliomyelitis and from Guillain-Barré syndrome, the relative freedom of children from neurological complications of AHC and the aetiological relationship of AHC virus to the syndrome have been discussed. It is concluded that this unusual neurological syndrome is caused by the neurovirulent properties of the AHC virus.
Document 3 (Title: Neuroanatomy, Lower Motor Neuron Lesion -- Clinical Significance -- Poliomyelitis): A classic example of solely LMN paralysis, poliomyelitis, has a fecal-oral transmission and is caused by a type of picornavirus: poliovirus. Once infected, the virus replicated in the oropharynx and small intestine before spreading via the bloodstream to the CNS. While replicating in the Peyer's patches of the small intestine, 95% of patients are asymptomatic, and it can only be found in the stool or via an oral swab. [5] In the CNS, the virus destroys the anterior (ventral) horn of the spinal cord, resulting in LMN paralysis. Because LMNs originate in the anterior horn of the spinal cord, this results in LMN signs such as asymmetric weakness, flaccid paralysis, fasciculations, hyporeflexia, and muscle atrophy. The infection could also result in respiratory involvement leading to respiratory paralysis. Other systemic signs of infection include fever, headache, nausea, and malaise. The cerebrospinal fluid would demonstrate increased WBC's and a slight elevation of protein, which is consistent with the viral infection. Once a prominent cause of paralysis, poliomyelitis has almost been eradicated due to widespread vaccination. [6] [7]
Document 4 (Title: Polio): Spinal polio, the most common form of paralytic poliomyelitis, results from viral invasion of the motor neurons of the anterior horn cells, or the ventral (front) grey matter section in the spinal column, which are responsible for movement of the muscles, including those of the trunk, limbs, and the intercostal muscles. Virus invasion causes inflammation of the nerve cells, leading to damage or destruction of motor neuron ganglia. When spinal neurons die, Wallerian degeneration takes place, leading to weakness of those muscles formerly innervated by the now-dead neurons. With the destruction of nerve cells, the muscles no longer receive signals from the brain or spinal cord; without nerve stimulation, the muscles atrophy, becoming weak, floppy and poorly controlled, and finally completely paralyzed. Maximum paralysis progresses rapidly (two to four days), and usually involves fever and muscle pain. Deep tendon reflexes are also affected, and are typically absent or diminished;
Document 5 (Title: Polio): Diagnosis Paralytic poliomyelitis may be clinically suspected in individuals experiencing acute onset of flaccid paralysis in one or more limbs with decreased or absent tendon reflexes in the affected limbs that cannot be attributed to another apparent cause, and without sensory or cognitive loss. A laboratory diagnosis is usually made based on the recovery of poliovirus from a stool sample or a swab of the pharynx. Antibodies to poliovirus can be diagnostic, and are generally detected in the blood of infected patients early in the course of infection. Analysis of the patient's cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which is collected by a lumbar puncture ("spinal tap"), reveals an increased number of white blood cells (primarily lymphocytes) and a mildly elevated protein level. Detection of virus in the CSF is diagnostic of paralytic polio but rarely occurs.

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
Question: A 12-year-old boy who recently emigrated from Pakistan presents with fever, muscle pain, and weakness of the trunk, abdomen, and legs. The patient’s mother says that he has not been vaccinated. Physical examination reveals fasciculation and flaccid paralysis of the lower limbs. A CSF analysis reveals lymphocytosis with normal glucose and protein levels. A throat swab reveals an RNA virus. Which of the following would most likely be destroyed by the virus in this patient?
Options:
A. Posterior horn cells of the spinal cord
B. Myelin sheath of neurons
C. Muscle cells
D. Anterior horn of the spinal cord
