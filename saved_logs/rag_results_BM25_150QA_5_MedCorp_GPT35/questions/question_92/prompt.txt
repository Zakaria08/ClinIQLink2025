Document 1 (Title: Intraabominal Abscesses -- Treatment / Management): The approach to abscess treatment varies by anatomic location. While a subdiaphragmatic abscess can be drained percutaneously, a pelvic abscess is accessed transrectally or transvaginally. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided drainage provides a safe and effective minimally invasive treatment option. [69] [70] Transesophageal and transgastric approaches have been used for a subphrenic abscess. [71] Splenic abscesses have been traditionally treated with splenectomy, but percutaneous drainage has been correlated with lower mortality and complication rates. [72] Results from a study showed that abscess size, age, inflammatory markers, leukocytosis, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were predictive of the need for surgical intervention due to failure of pharmacologic treatment. [73]
Document 2 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): fibers into bundles, one for illu-mination and one for imaging. The earliest upper endoscopes revolutionized the diagnosis and treatment of gastroesophageal reflux and peptic ulcer disease and made possible early detec-tion of upper and lower gastrointestinal (GI) cancer at a stage that could be cured. The first endoscopic surgical procedure was the colonoscopic polypectomy, developed by Shinya and Wolfe, two surgeons from New York City. The percutane-ous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) invented by Gauderer and Ponsky may have been the first NOTES procedure, reported in 1981.5 Endoscopic pancreatic pseudocyst drainage is thought to be the next NOTES procedure developed; however, there was little energy and money put into the development of NOTES until a number of gastroenterologists claimed the ability to remove the gallbladder with a flexible endoscope, using a transgastric technique. With this pronouncement, the surgical community took notice and seized the momentum for NOTES
Document 3 (Title: A novel endoscopic transgastric fundoplication procedure for gastroesophageal reflux: an initial animal evaluation.): Complications of gastroesophageal reflux are common in adults and children. A variety of surgical procedures have been successfully used to treat this condition. All current techniques require open surgery and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality, particularly in the high risk, neurologically damaged child. The authors have developed a novel method of creating a gastric fundoplication using an endoscopic transgastric approach in pigs. The procedure involves the creation of an esophageal intussusception into the stomach under direct vision with an endoscope. The gastric fundus is then plicated around the esophagus using a custom stapling device. The transgastric approach allows creation of a fundoplication, is easily performed, is potentially effective at preventing gastroesophageal reflux, and has the obvious advantages of minimally invasive surgery over open techniques of fundoplication.
Document 4 (Title: Pseudocyst): Endoscopic drainage is becoming the preferred method of draining pseudocysts because it is less invasive, does not require external drain, and has a large long-term success rate. Drainage is usually achieved with a transpapillary approach with ERCP. Sometimes a direct drainage across the stomach or duodenal wall is used instead. The transpapillary approach is used when the pseudocyst is in communication with the main pancreatic duct, and is also successful in patients with pancreatic duct disruption. Transgastric or transduodenal approaches are used when the pseudocyst is next to the gastro-duodenal wall. Endoscopic ultrasound is the most commonly used test to gather the needed information about the pseudocyst for this method.
Document 5 (Title: [Transgastric lymphadenography].): The transgastric lymphadenography technique carried out by the endoscopic route in 52 patients at the Digestive Endoscopy Centre of the 3rd Surgical Clinic of Rome University is described. On the basis of personal results it is considered that transgastric lymphadenography represents an interesting technique for the study of perigastric lymphnodes in normal and pathologic conditions. It is thought that it could also be useful in the study of the abdominal lymphatics although further verification and a larger series are necessary.
