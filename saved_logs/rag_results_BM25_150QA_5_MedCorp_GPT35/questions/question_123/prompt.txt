Document 1 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Nonrenal Loss of Potassium The loss of K+ in sweat is typically low, except under extremes of physical exertion. Direct gastric losses of K+ due to vomiting or nasogastric suctioning are also minimal; however, the ensuing hypochloremic alkalosis results in persistent kaliuresis due to secondary hyperaldosteronism and bicarbonaturia, i.e., a renal loss CAuSES of HyPoKALEMiA I.

Document 2 (Title: Selective Beta-1 Blockers -- Toxicity): Immediate monitoring of blood pressure with a blood pressure cuff and cardiac electrical activity with an EKG is necessary. Acquiring blood glucose levels, a basic metabolic panel, and acetaminophen and salicylate levels help identify sequelae of beta-1-blocker overdose and toxicity, as well as identifying any medications that may have been co-ingested. In severely hypotensive patients, one should consider obtaining a lactate level due to the possibility of mesenteric ischemia. Patients being treated within 1 to 2 hours of ingestion may benefit from activated charcoal, or gastric lavage may be necessary for patients who present immediately after large ingestions or with severe adverse symptoms.
Document 3 (Title: [Treatment of severe digitalis-intoxication in suicidal attempt (author's transl)].): 4 patients tried to commit suicide by ingestion of 45 to 100 tablets of digoxin (Lanicor 0,25 mg) and acteyldigoxin (Novodigal 0,2 mg) respectively. In all patients cardiac arrhythmias occurred including 3 rd degree av-block, tachyarrhythmias and ventricular fibrillation which was lethal in two patients. After a short period hyperkaliaemia a rapid decrease of potassium in the serum was observed 3-12 hours after administration of digoxin. This loss of potassium was due to an increased excretion of potassium and sodium in the urine. It is thought that a reversible tubular leakage is responsible for the loss of electrolytes by the kidney rather than an inhibition of the ATPase in kidney tissue. From our observations the following therapy scheme for digitalis-intoxication is recommended: 1. Gastric lavage and administration of absorbents (charcoal, cholestyramin) in order to decrease the absorption of the glycosides and to interrupt the enterohepatic circulation. 2. Substitution of electrolytes by infusions and by oral route to balance sodium and potassium levels in the serum. 3. Administration of diphenylhydantoin for treatment of cardiac arrhythmias. 4. Implantation of a temporary pacemaker for treatment of cardiac arrhythmias especially for the management of bradycardias. 5. Plasmapheresis to lower the glycosid concentration in the heart muscle and in other tissues.
Document 4 (Title: Ibuprofen): Treatment to address an ibuprofen overdose is based on how the symptoms present. In cases presenting early, decontamination of the stomach is recommended. This is achieved using activated charcoal; charcoal adsorbs the drug before it can enter the bloodstream. Gastric lavage is now rarely used, but can be considered if the amount ingested is potentially life-threatening, and it can be performed within 60 minutes of ingestion. Purposeful vomiting is not recommended. The majority of ibuprofen ingestions produce only mild effects, and the management of overdose is straightforward. Standard measures to maintain normal urine output should be instituted and kidney function monitored. Since ibuprofen has acidic properties and is also excreted in the urine, forced alkaline diuresis is theoretically beneficial. However, because ibuprofen is highly protein-bound in the blood, the kidneys' excretion of unchanged drug is minimal. Forced alkaline diuresis is, therefore, of limited benefit.
Document 5 (Title: Bufotalin): Toxicity Specifically, in cats the lethal median dose is 0.13 mg/kg. and in dogs is 0.36 mg/kg (intravenous). Knowing this it is advisable to monitor those functions continuously using an EKG. As there is no antidote against bufotalin all occurring symptoms need to be treated separately or if possible in combination with others. To increase the clearance theoretically, due to the similarities with digitoxin, cholestyramine, a bile salt, might help. Recent animal studies have shown that taurine restores cardiac functions. Symptomatic measures include lignocaine, atropine and phenytoin for cardiac toxicity and intravenous potassium compounds to correct hyperkalaemia from its effect on the Na+/K+ ATPase pump.
