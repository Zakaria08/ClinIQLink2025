        "title": "[Treatment of severe digitalis-intoxication in suicidal attempt (author's transl)].",
        "content": "4 patients tried to commit suicide by ingestion of 45 to 100 tablets of digoxin (Lanicor 0,25 mg) and acteyldigoxin (Novodigal 0,2 mg) respectively. In all patients cardiac arrhythmias occurred including 3 rd degree av-block, tachyarrhythmias and ventricular fibrillation which was lethal in two patients. After a short period hyperkaliaemia a rapid decrease of potassium in the serum was observed 3-12 hours after administration of digoxin. This loss of potassium was due to an increased excretion of potassium and sodium in the urine. It is thought that a reversible tubular leakage is responsible for the loss of electrolytes by the kidney rather than an inhibition of the ATPase in kidney tissue. From our observations the following therapy scheme for digitalis-intoxication is recommended: 1. Gastric lavage and administration of absorbents (charcoal, cholestyramin) in order to decrease the absorption of the glycosides and to interrupt the enterohepatic circulation. 2. Substitution of electrolytes by infusions and by oral route to balance sodium and potassium levels in the serum. 3. Administration of diphenylhydantoin for treatment of cardiac arrhythmias. 4. Implantation of a temporary pacemaker for treatment of cardiac arrhythmias especially for the management of bradycardias. 5. Plasmapheresis to lower the glycosid concentration in the heart muscle and in other tissues.",

        "content": "Treatment to address an ibuprofen overdose is based on how the symptoms present. In cases presenting early, decontamination of the stomach is recommended. This is achieved using activated charcoal; charcoal adsorbs the drug before it can enter the bloodstream. Gastric lavage is now rarely used, but can be considered if the amount ingested is potentially life-threatening, and it can be performed within 60 minutes of ingestion. Purposeful vomiting is not recommended. The majority of ibuprofen ingestions produce only mild effects, and the management of overdose is straightforward. Standard measures to maintain normal urine output should be instituted and kidney function monitored. Since ibuprofen has acidic properties and is also excreted in the urine, forced alkaline diuresis is theoretically beneficial. However, because ibuprofen is highly protein-bound in the blood, the kidneys' excretion of unchanged drug is minimal. Forced alkaline diuresis is, therefore, of limited benefit.",
