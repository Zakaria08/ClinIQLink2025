Document 1 (Title: Orthotopic liver transplants necessitated by acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity.): Acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity has been recognized since 1966. Patients experiencing a massive hepatic insult due to acetaminophen (APAP) may recover with minimal residual complications or develop fulminant hepatic necrosis. We report 3 patients with hepatic failure due to an APAP overdose who received orthotopic liver transplants and survived. An 18-y-o female ingested 60 500 mg APAP tablets (30 g). She presented with tachycardia and lethargy stating that she had taken amoxipine, carbamazepine, and lorazepam. She began to recover but on day 2 experienced an upper gastrointestinal bleed and became hypotensive and hyperpyrexic. She developed hepatic encephalopathy and it was then determined she had ingested APAP. Her APAP level was 13 micrograms/ml 96 h post-ingestion. She was successfully transplanted 19 d post-ingestion with recovery. A 40-y-o female was admitted for flu-like symptoms persisting for 7 d. She was jaundiced, hyperventilating and hypotensive. She admitted ingesting approximately 17 g APAP over 36 h. Her APAP level was 12.2 micrograms/ml. Her condition worsened and on day 3 she was in grade IV coma. She was successfully transplanted 4 d post-arrival with recovery. A 16-y-o female ingested an unknown amount of APAP. She presented approximately 24 h post-ingestion with a serum APAP level of 130 micrograms/ml. Her condition deteriorated and she became encephalopathic with grade IV coma. She was successfully transplanted on day 7 post-arrival. Hepatotoxicity can occur as a result of either acute or chronic APAP overdose. Although n-acetylcysteine (NAC) is effective antidotal therapy, it must be used within 8-12 h post-ingestion to be optimally effective. Inaccurate patient histories may prevent NAC administration resulting in hepatotoxicity. Liver transplantation is a viable option to be considered in those APAP overdose patients who experience rapidly progressing encephalopathy, hemolysis, and hepato-renal failure.
Document 2 (Title: Case Study: 33-Year-Old Female Presents with Chronic SOB and Cough (Archived) -- Case Presentation): History of Present Illness: A 33-year-old white female presents after admission to the general medical/surgical hospital ward with a chief complaint of shortness of breath on exertion. She reports that she was seen for similar symptoms previously at her primary care physician’s office six months ago. At that time, she was diagnosed with acute bronchitis and treated with bronchodilators, empiric antibiotics, and a short course oral steroid taper. This management did not improve her symptoms, and she has gradually worsened over six months. She reports a 20-pound (9 kg) intentional weight loss over the past year. She denies camping, spelunking, or hunting activities. She denies any sick contacts. A brief review of systems is negative for fever, night sweats, palpitations, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, neural sensation changes, muscular changes, and increased bruising or bleeding. She admits a cough, shortness of breath, and shortness of breath on exertion.
Document 3 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): A 59-year-old woman presents to an urgent care clinic with a 4-day history of frequent and painful urination. She has had fevers, chills, and flank pain for the past 2 days. Her physician advised her to come immediately to the clinic for evaluation. In the clinic she is febrile (38.5°C [101.3°F]) but otherwise stable and states she is not experiencing any nausea or vomiting. Her urine dipstick test is positive for leukocyte esterase. Urinalysis and urine culture are ordered. Her past medical history is significant for three urinary tract infections in the past year. Each episode was uncom-plicated, treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and promptly resolved. She also has osteoporosis for which she takes a daily calcium supplement. The decision is made to treat her with oral antibiotics for a complicated urinary tract infection with close follow-up. Given her history, what would be a reasonable empiric antibiotic choice? Depending on the antibiotic choice are there potential drug
Document 4 (Title: Hypogammaglobulinemia): The presenting feature of hypogammaglobulinemia is usually a clinical history of recurrent, chronic, or atypical infections. These infections include but are not limited to: bronchitis, ear infections, meningitis, pneumonia, sinus infections, and skin infections. Such infections can potentially damage organs, leading to severe complications. Other symptoms of hypogammaglobulinemia include chronic diarrhea and complications from receiving live vaccines. Certain symptoms of chronic damage may be related to recurrent infection. For example, shortness of breath, chronic cough, and sputum production may indicate the presence of bronchiectasis. Sinus pain, nasal discharge, and postnasal drip may indicate the presence of chronic sinusitis. Diarrhea and steatorrhea may indicate malabsorption. Another sign or symptom that may occur in patients is blotchiness of the skin color, especially noticed above the waist, on the arms, neck, and upper chest areas, however, it may occur anywhere
Document 5 (Title: Gluten-sensitive enteropathy–associated conditions): Deficiencies Avitaminosis. Avitaminosis caused by malabsorption in GSE can result in decline of fat soluble vitamins and vitamin B, as well as malabsorption of essential fatty acids. This can cause a wide variety of secondary problems. Hypocalcinemia is also associated with GSE. In treated GSE, the restrictions on diet as well as reduced absorption as a result of prolonged damage may result in post treatment deficiencies. Vitamin A – Poor absorption of vitamin A has been seen in coeliac disease. and it has been suggested that GSE-associated cancers of the esophagus may be related to vitamin A deficiency Folate deficiency – Folate deficiency is believed to be primary to the following secondary conditions: Megaloblastic anemia Calcification of brain channels – epilepsy, dementia, visual manifestations.
