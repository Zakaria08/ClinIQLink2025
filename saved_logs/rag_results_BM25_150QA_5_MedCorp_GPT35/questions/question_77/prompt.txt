Document 1 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Halofantrine exhibits erratic bioavailability, but its absorption is significantly enhanced when it is taken with a fatty meal. The elimination half-life of halofantrine is 1–2 days; it is excreted mainly in feces. Halofantrine is metabolized into N-debutyl-halofantrine by the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP3A4. Grapefruit juice should be avoided during treatment because it increases both halofantrine’s bioavailability and halofantrine-induced QT interval prolongation by inhibiting CYP3A4 at the enterocyte level.
Document 2 (Title: Halofantrine. A review of its antimalarial activity, pharmacokinetic properties and therapeutic potential.): Halofantrine is an orally administered blood schizontocide which is active against both chloroquine-sensitive and chloroquine-resistant plasmodia. Dose-finding and noncomparative clinical trials have confirmed the efficacy of halofantrine in the treatment of falciparum malaria in areas of chloroquine- and sulfonamide/pyrimethamine-resistant malaria and vivax malaria. However, poor results obtained in patients who failed mefloquine prophylaxis suggest that the efficacy of halofantrine may not extend to mefloquine-resistant P. falciparum, although more studies are needed to confirm this. Data concerning halofantrine in the treatment of P. ovale and P. malariae infections are still limited. One comparative study indicates that halofantrine has an efficacy equivalent to that of mefloquine and may be better tolerated. Halofantrine is generally well tolerated in both adults and children, the most common drug-associated effects being abdominal pain, pruritus, vomiting, diarrhoea, headache and rash, although it is difficult to distinguish between disease- and treatment-related events. The development of parasite resistance to halofantrine, like other blood schizontocides, is inevitable. Poor absorption resulting in variable peak plasma halofantrine concentrations, and possible cross-resistance with mefloquine, may accelerate the emergence of resistance to halofantrine. Thus, it is of primary importance that halofantrine is used only in areas where chloroquine- and sulfonamide/pyrimethamine-resistance are established in order to preserve and sustain its efficacy. If used with care, halofantrine will provide an important treatment option for falciparum malaria, a widespread parasitic disease associated with considerable morbidity against which the number of effective drugs available is being increasingly compromised by the spread of resistance.
Document 3 (Title: Halofantrine): Pharmacology The mechanism of action of halofantrine is unknown. The absorption of halofantrine is erratic, but is increased when taken with fatty food. Because of fears of toxicity due to increased halofantrine blood levels, halofantrine should be taken on an empty stomach. Plasma levels peak at 16 hours and the half-life of the drug is about 4 days. Uses Halofantrine is only used to treat malaria. It is not used to prevent malaria (prophylaxis) because of the risk of toxicity and unreliable absorption. Dosing Adult dose: three doses of 500 mg six hours apart. Halofantrine should be taken on an empty stomach. Manufacturing information and availability Halfan (GlaxoSmithKline) is available as 250 mg tablets. A full course of treatment (6 tablets) costs US$1.40 in the developing world. Halofantrine is not available in the UK or U.S. References Secondary alcohols Antimalarial agents Chloroarenes Trifluoromethyl compounds Phenanthrenes SRI International
Document 4 (Title: Otoacoustic Emissions -- Issues of Concern -- Ototoxicity Monitoring): Over the last decade, OAE has been increasingly used to monitor the ototoxicity of medications, particularly aminoglycoside antibiotics and platinum-based chemotherapy agents. Ototoxic drugs affect the outer hair cells and are detectable on OAE before a conventional audiogram. Its quick application and cost efficiency make it a good clinical choice to follow patients during their therapeutic course. DPOAEs are more sensitive to the higher frequencies, which are commonly affected first in ototoxicity. Prior to starting ototoxic medications, patients should undergo baseline OAE testing and again with each dose of ototoxic medication. Changes of 2.4 dB or more are considered a significant decrease and indicate a change in cochlear function. [16]
Document 5 (Title: Torsemide -- Toxicity): Ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity occur with concomitant use of nephro or ototoxic medications. Animal studies have shown temporary ototoxicity with no permanent effect. [9] Further research is necessary for confirmation of temporary vs. permanent ototoxic effects in humans.
