Document 1 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): Camille E. Beauduy, PharmD, & Lisa G. Winston, MD motion tenderness is present. A first-catch urine specimen is obtained for chlamydia and gonorrhea nucleic acid amplifi-cation testing. A urine pregnancy test is also ordered as the patient reports she “missed her last period.” Pending these results, the decision is made to treat her presumptively for chlamydial cervicitis. What are two potential treatment options for her possible chlamydial infection? How does her potential pregnancy affect the treatment decision? A 22-year-old woman presents to her college medical clinic complaining of a 2-week history of vaginal discharge. She denies any fever or abdominal pain but does report vaginal bleeding after sexual intercourse. When questioned about her sexual activity, she reports having vaginal intercourse, at times unprotected, with two men in the last 6 months. A pelvic examination is performed and is positive for muco-purulent discharge from the endocervical canal. No cervical
Document 2 (Title: Case Study: 33-Year-Old Female Presents with Chronic SOB and Cough (Archived) -- Case Presentation): History of Present Illness: A 33-year-old white female presents after admission to the general medical/surgical hospital ward with a chief complaint of shortness of breath on exertion. She reports that she was seen for similar symptoms previously at her primary care physician’s office six months ago. At that time, she was diagnosed with acute bronchitis and treated with bronchodilators, empiric antibiotics, and a short course oral steroid taper. This management did not improve her symptoms, and she has gradually worsened over six months. She reports a 20-pound (9 kg) intentional weight loss over the past year. She denies camping, spelunking, or hunting activities. She denies any sick contacts. A brief review of systems is negative for fever, night sweats, palpitations, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, neural sensation changes, muscular changes, and increased bruising or bleeding. She admits a cough, shortness of breath, and shortness of breath on exertion.
Document 3 (Title: McCune–Albright syndrome): Precocious puberty: The most common endocrinopathy is precocious puberty, which presents in girls (~85%) with recurrent estrogen-producing cysts leading to episodic breast development, growth acceleration, and vaginal bleeding. Precocious puberty may also occur in boys with McCune–Albright syndrome, but is much less common (~10–15%). In children of both sexes, growth acceleration may lead to tall stature in childhood, however premature bone maturation may lead to early growth plate fusion and short stature in adulthood. Testicular abnormalities: Testicular abnormalities are seen in a majority (~85%) of boys with McCune–Albright syndrome. These typically present with macro-orchidism. On pathology lesions show Leydig and Sertoli cell hyperplasia. Hyperthyroidism: Hyperthyroidism occurs in approximately one-third of patients with McCune Albright syndrome. Patients have characteristic abnormalities on thyroid ultrasound, and may have a slight increased risk for thyroid cancer.
Document 4 (Title: [Suprasellar arachnoid cyst associated with precocious puberty: report of an operated case and review of the literature].): The pathogenesis remains unknown in the majority of patients with precocious puberty, and yet infrequently such causative cerebral lesions as hypothalamic hamartomas are associated with sexual precocity. We reported a rare case of suprasellar arachnoid cyst in an infant presenting with precocious puberty, which eventually disappeared after a cyst-peritoneal shunt. It was believed that the mass effect of the arachnoid cyst upon the hypothalamus was, at least in part, responsible for development of precocious puberty. The role of surgical decompression of the cyst was also discussed. A one-year-old girl was admitted to the hospital for evaluation of genital bleeding which had persisted on and off for two months. The height, 80cm, and the weight, 12.4kg, exceeded by far the two standard deviations from the mean level of the normal population. In addition she had the development of breast tissue as classified Tanner's Stage II, and both pubic and axillary hair. The bone age by skeletal survey of the hand was rated as 3 years. Endocrinological examination showed that serum levels of luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol had increased for her age, to levels equivalent to those for females at puberty. An LH-RH test revealed an excessive LH reaction. There were no definite neurological deficits. CT and MRI demonstrated the presence of a large arachnoid cyst involving the suprasellar region as well as the right middle and posterior fossa. After the patient underwent a cyst-peritoneal shunt, the cyst decreased in size and such symptoms as genital bleeding and breast growth disappeared. Serum levels of her LH and FSH also significantly decreased.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Document 5 (Title: [A case of fibrous dysplasia (McCune Albright syndrome) associated with acromegaly].): We report a case of a 47-year-old woman with McCune-Albright syndrome associated with unusual growth-hormone and prolactin hypersecretion. Acromegaly was suspected on clinical examination, and she was referred to us. She had no history of precocious puberty or pathological fracture. She was 154cm tall, weighing 62kg with so-called acromegalic facies. There were two lumps, one of which was on her right lateral forehead. The other on the right lower extremity seemed to be due to a bone deformity. Some brown pigmented macules with irregular borders were present on her lips and oral mucosa. Endocrine examination revealed elevated basal levels of plasma GH (54ng/ml) and PRL (36.2ng/ml), which paradoxically increased after injection of TRH. Plasma levels of these hormones did not change after LHRH test, and plasma GH level increased after GHRH test. A skull X-ray film showed a double floor of the sella turcia and hyperostotic formation of the right sphenoid bone. MRI and CT showed a tumor shadow in the right sella turcica. Bone roentogenography of the right fibula and tibia showed a large centrally expanding lesion with a ground-glass or cystic appearance and a thin cortex. The left fibula showed a similar lesion. We recognized similar findings in other bones which also showed abnormal accumulation in a radionuclide bone scan with 99mTc. On the basis of physical, endocrinological and roentogenographical examination, we diagnosed her as displaying McCune-Albright syndrome. We operated on her by transsphenoidal surgery and confirmed a functioning chromophobe adenoma which was removed during surgery. She has been free of GH and PRL hypersecretion since then. The pathology of the sphenoidal sinus affected with fibrous bone was in accordance with the findings of fibrous dysplasia. McCune-Albright syndrome (MCAS) is known as a syndrome characterized by polyostotic fibrous dysplasia and cutaneous pigmentation and multiple endocrinopathy. Its etiology is unknown. This syndrome with acromegaly is rare, and although 26 cases have been described in literature, pathological examinations have been undertaken in only three cases. This case was very rare and valuable because, by operating on her by the transsphenoidal route in spite of the sphenoidal sinus being affected with fibrous bone, we were able to confirm a chromophobe adenoma secreting both GH and PRL. We recognized that acromegaly with MCAS was endocrinologically, morphologically and immunohistologically the same as acromegaly without MCAS. Therefore, we concluded that acromegaly with MCAS is much the same as acromegaly without MCAS.

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
Question: A 5-year-old girl is brought to the clinic by her mother for excessive hair growth. Her mother reports that for the past 2 months she has noticed hair at the axillary and pubic areas. She denies any family history of precocious puberty and reports that her daughter has been relatively healthy with an uncomplicated birth history. She denies any recent illnesses, weight change, fever, vaginal bleeding, pain, or medication use. Physical examination demonstrates Tanner stage 4 development. A pelvic ultrasound shows an ovarian mass. Laboratory studies demonstrates an elevated level of estrogen. What is the most likely diagnosis?
Options:
A. Granulosa cell tumor
B. Idiopathic precocious puberty
C. McCune-Albright syndrome
D. Sertoli-Leydig tumor
