Document 1 (Title: [The treatment of nocturnal enuresis. A comparative study between desmopressin and acupuncture used alone or in combination].): During the period from March to September 1989, 40 children suffering from primary nocturnal enuresis, aged between 5 and 14 years, were included in a study to assess the comparative therapeutical efficacy of DDAVP and acupuncture. Children were divided into four groups of 10: group A was treated with DDAVP, group B was treated with acupuncture, group C was treated with DDAVP and acupuncture and group D was treated with placebo (control). The trial design included 3 periods: observation (2 weeks), treatment (8 weeks) and follow-up (4 weeks). Nineteen children completed the study. The efficacy of treatment, which was expressed as a percentage of dry nights, was high in both the DDAVP and acupuncture groups, when used separately. The combined treatment of DDAVP and acupuncture appeared to be the most efficacious both in terms of the percentage of dry nights at the end of treatment and in relation to the stability of results, even after the end of the study. The paper gives a detailed analysis of correlations between type of treatment and urinary osmolarity.
Document 2 (Title: Acupuncture): Efficacy Acupuncture has been researched extensively; as of 2013, there were almost 1,500 randomized controlled trials on PubMed with "acupuncture" in the title. The results of reviews of acupuncture's efficacy, however, have been inconclusive. In January 2020, David Gorski analyzed a 2020 review of systematic reviews ("Acupuncture for the Relief of Chronic Pain: A Synthesis of Systematic Reviews") concerning the use of acupuncture to treat chronic pain. Writing in Science-Based Medicine, Gorski said that its findings highlight the conclusion that acupuncture is "a theatrical placebo whose real history has been retconned beyond recognition." He also said this review "reveals the many weaknesses in the design of acupuncture clinical trials".
Document 3 (Title: Acupuncture -- Clinical Significance -- Conditions): Acupuncture has also been used to treat lateral epicondyle tendinopathy.  However, there were mixed results on its efficacy [29] . Patients with tendinopathy who either have mild disease and wish to minimize medication management may wish to try acupuncture [30] . Separately studies have focused on Achilles tendinopathy and the use of acupuncture; patients did not report improved pain as well as function at both 16 and 24-week follow-up [31] .
Document 4 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Trials do not support the efficacy of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for CLBP. However, depression is common among patients with chronic pain and should be appropriately treated. Cognitive-behavioral therapy is based on evidence that psychological and social factors, as well as somatic pathology, are important in the genesis of chronic pain and disability. Cognitive-behavioral therapy includes efforts to identify and modify patients’ thinking about their pain and disability. A systematic review concluded that such treatments are more effective than a waiting list control group for short-term pain relief; however, long-term results remain unclear. Behavioral treatments may have effects similar in magnitude to exercise therapy. Back pain is the most frequent reason for seeking complementary and alternative treatments. The most common of these for back pain are spinal manipulation, acupuncture, and massage. The role of most complementary and alternative medicine
Document 5 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): related side effects for patients undergoing surgery.290 Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting PreventionPONV is a common complication after surgery. Acupuncture and herbs can be applied to prevent and treat PONV. Acupunc-ture or transcutaneous electroacupuncture improves stress-induced impairment in gastric motility functions, significantly inhibits the frequency of transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxations in response to gastric distention, and suppresses retrograde peristaltic contraction.291-293 In clinical trials, intra-operative P6 acupuncture point (Neiguan acupoint) stimulation during surgery significantly reduces the incidence of PONV over 24 hours, and the efficacy of P6 stimulation is similar to that of commonly used antiemetic drugs in the prevention of PONV.294 Furthermore, electroacupuncture restrains the release of gastrointestinal peptides and consequently relieves PONV with an efficacy comparable to ondansetron.295 Moreover, a randomized, prospective,
