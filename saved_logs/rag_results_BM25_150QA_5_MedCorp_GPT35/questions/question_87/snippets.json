        "content": "A positive FDG-PET scan means a tissue biopsy is indicated in that location. [8] In FDG-PET evaluation of cancers of the esophagus and gastroesophageal junction, FDG-PET had lower accuracy in the diagnosis of locoregional nodes (N1\u20132) than combined CT (computed tomography) and EUS (endoscopic ultrasound) (48% vs. 69%) because of a lack of sensitivity (22% vs. 83%). The accuracy for distant nodal metastasis was significantly higher for FDG-PET than the combined use of CT & EUS. Sensitivity was no different; however, specificity was higher. FDG-PET correctly upstaged\u00a05 patients (12%) from the N1\u20132 stage to the M+Ly stage, while\u00a01 was falsely downstaged by FDG-PET scanning. [9] In a study on the role of FDG PET scan in colorectal cancer screening in asymptomatic adults, it was found that the sensitivity of FDG-PET to detect primary colorectal cancer is high, with primary colorectal cancer being detected with FDG PET in a resectable stage. FDG-PET could detect large size (> 0.7 cm) and pre-malignant change of colonic adenomas. It\u2019s possible to differentiate adenoma from colon carcinoma by assessing the increase in the rate of glycolysis in carcinoma. [10]",

        "content": "An orthotopically transplanted, locally metastasizing rat bladder tumor model was developed to evaluate the extent of uptake of fluoro-deoxy-glucose (FDG) in bladder cancer. Significant uptake of FDG in localized bladder tumors in rats was shown, with an average tumor-to-blood ratio of 39 at 2 hours after intravenous FDG administration. Metastases (3 nodal and 1 peritoneal) also showed significant uptake of FDG, with an average metastasis-to-blood ratio of 21.7, and tumor involved-to-normal lymph node ratio of 5.3. Because FDG is excreted in the urine, urinary FDG potentially could prevent the use of FDG/positron emission tomography (FDG/PET) scanning for localized bladder cancer. Bladder lavage successfully reduced the retention of FDG in the normal rat bladder, with an estimated uptake ratio of tumor-to-normal bladder of 13.1 after 5 ml. saline irrigation. Based on these data, we performed an FDG/PET scan of a patient with biopsy proved recurrent intravesical bladder cancer after radiation therapy. Computerized tomography (CT) of the pelvis showed abnormalities consistent with radiation scarring and extravesical tumor. Due to the scarring, the extent of tumor growth could not be determined. The patient also had pulmonary opacities seen on chest radiography. The FDG/PET scan of this patient showed significant extravesical uptake in the pelvis, confirming the abnormality noted on CT. Good images of the clinically apparent metastases in the chest also were obtained. These preliminary data indicate that FDG/PET imaging of bladder cancer is feasible and it may provide new information for the diagnosis and staging of patients with bladder cancer.",

        "content": "The value of positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in differentiating recurrent rectal cancer and scar was investigated. PET with fluorine-18 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) and MR imaging were performed in 15 patients with suspected recurrence. FDG accumulation in the mass was measured by means of the differential absorption ratio (DAR). All 11 patients with confirmed recurrent rectal cancer had increased accumulation of FDG in the mass (DAR = 4.73 +/- 2.28). Low FDG accumulation in the mass (DAR = 0.97 +/- 0.15) was noted in the remaining four patients, in whom the presence of a scar was proved by means of follow-up observation with or without biopsy. On the MR images, the recurrent tumor could be differentiated from scar in all but one case. The lesion-muscle signal intensity ratios on the T2-weighted images for the recurrent tumor and scar were 2.18 +/- 0.55 and 0.89 +/- 0.30, respectively. PET and MR imaging complement each other in the differential diagnosis between recurrent rectal cancer and scar. PET may also permit the evaluation of the effect of therapy.",
