Document 1 (Title: Early retransfer: a method of optimal bed utilization of NICU beds.): To facilitate increased utility of Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) beds, we adopted a policy of early discharge (ED) of infants less than 2000 g to the hospital of their birth after recovery from acute illness and when the infant was breathing room air and taking adequate oral feedings. An inservice teaching program at the primary hospitals preceded such policy. In a 24-month period, 446 infants were referred to the NICU. 111 of 446 died; 335 infants survived. 114 of 335 infants were less than 2000 g at birth; 42% (48 of 114) of them were discharged early to the hospital of their birth (ED); 58% were discharged late (LD) to their homes. 59.7% of the ED and 46.3% of the LD required assisted ventilation. Gestational age, birth weight, and final weight at discharge from hospitals were the same in both groups. None of the ED infants developed complications at the hospital of birth after retransfer. The length of NICU stay for LD was significantly higher 40 +/- 6 (p less than 0.001) than the ED; 20 +/- 2.2 days. In addition, a 15% increase in bed utilization was also noted because of ED. We conclude that ED of infants from the NICU 1) increases utilization of beds; 2) decreases the cost of health care; and 3) increases the participation of primary physicians.
Document 2 (Title: Nicotine Addiction and Smoking: Health Effects and Interventions (Nursing) -- Risk Factors): Secondhand smoke from cigarettes and cigars also causes heart disease and lung cancer in adults and a number of health problems in infants and children, including: Asthma Respiratory infections and reactive airway Ear infections Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)
Document 3 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Secondhand tobacco smoke (Chap. 470), radon gas, wood smoke, and other biologic agents generated indoors must be considered. Several studies have shown that the respirable particulate load in any household is directly proportional to the number of cigarette smokers living in that home. Increases in prevalence of respiratory illnesses, especially asthma, and reduced levels of pulmonary function measured with simple spirometry have been found in the children of smoking parents in a number of studies. Recent meta-analyses for lung cancer and cardiopulmonary diseases, combining data from multiple secondhand tobacco smoke epidemiologic studies, suggest an ~25% increase in relative risk for each condition, even after adjustment for major potential confounders.
Document 4 (Title: Passive smoking): Lung problems: Risk of asthma. Risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) According to a 2015 review, passive smoking may increase the risk of tuberculosis infection and accelerate the progression of the disease, but the evidence remains weak. The majority of studies on the association between secondhand smoke exposure and sinusitis have found a significant association between the two. Cognitive impairment and dementia: Exposure to secondhand smoke may increase the risk of cognitive impairment and dementia in adults 50 and over. Children exposed to secondhand smoke show reduced vocabulary and reasoning skills when compared with non-exposed children as well as more general cognitive and intellectual deficits. Mental health: Exposure to secondhand smoke is associated with an increased risk of depressive symptoms. During pregnancy: Miscarriage: a 2014 meta-analysis found that maternal secondhand smoke exposure increased the risk of miscarriage by 11%.
Document 5 (Title: Passive smoking): Risk to children Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). In his 2006 report, the US Surgeon General concludes: "The evidence is sufficient to infer a causal relationship between exposure to secondhand smoke and sudden infant death syndrome." Secondhand smoking has been estimated to be associated with 430 SIDS deaths in the United States annually. Asthma. Secondhand smoke exposure is also associated with an almost doubled risk of hospitalization for asthma exacerbation among children with asthma. Lung infections, also including more severe illness with bronchiolitis and bronchitis, and worse outcome, as well as increased risk of developing tuberculosis if exposed to a carrier. In the United States, it is estimated that secondhand smoke has been associated with between 150,000 and 300,000 lower respiratory tract infections in infants and children under 18 months of age, resulting in between 7,500 and 15,000 hospitalizations each year.
