        "content": "During a follow-up appointment a few weeks later, he complained of multiple subcutaneous nodules. On physical exam, multiple, tender, non-erythematous subcutaneous nodules were noted along with a palpable, non-tender mass on the left side of the abdomen. CT abdomen showed a large heterogeneous mass measuring 20.1 by 10.7 by 18.1 cm, in the left quadrant of the abdomen along with a poorly defined low attenuation mass measuring 2.9 by 3 cm in the right hepatic lobe. CT guided biopsy of the left-sided abdominal mass was non-diagnostic. He underwent exploratory laparotomy, with excision of the left-sided abdominal mass along with splenectomy and distal pancreatectomy. There were multiple abnormal areas in the liver concerning for metastases. Pathology of the resected mass revealed sheets of malignant acinar cells with no intervening ductal structures or islets. Tumor cells were positive for trypsin and cytokeratin and were negative for CD117 and synaptophysin, consistent with pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma. Serum CA 19-9 levels were high. Lipase levels were elevated at 40,000U/dL.\u00a0At this point, based on the biopsy and staging, the patient was diagnosed with stage IV pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma, but the cause of his polyarthralgia\u00a0was still uncertain.\u00a0Adjuvant chemotherapy\u00a0was initiated\u00a0with leucovorin, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and oxaliplatin for the carcinoma. During his treatment, his joint swelling and pain progressed and involved new joints of\u00a0right ankle and left knee. Imaging studies of the joints showed joint effusion and soft tissue swelling. Arthrocentesis of the right ankle joint\u00a0was performed, and the synovial fluid studies were consistent with infection and cultures were positive for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Pseudomonas. He was treated with antibiotics including vancomycin and piperacillin\u2013tazobactam without any improvement. Due to progressive worsening of the right ankle joint, he required irrigation and debridement with arthrotomy. Repeat cultures were negative, but his symptoms continued\u00a0to worsen, and he had persistent drainage of milky colored fluid from the surgical site and eventually required a below-knee amputation. Surgical pathology of the right knee joint revealed acute on chronic inflammation with the presence of granulation and fibrin tissue, without any evidence of malignancy. For further evaluation,\u00a0arthrocentesis of left knee, left ankle, and right wrist was done and yielded milky colored fluid.\u00a0His lipase levels continued to remain above 20,000 U/dL despite being treated with chemotherapy.",

        "title": "[A case of facial nerve neurinoma originated from the cerebellopontine angle portion].",
        "content": "Facial nerve neurinomas are relatively rare and most of them appear at the vertical portion of the facial nerve. Facial nerve neurinoma originated from the cerebellopontine (c-p) angle portion is less frequently reported. A 51-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital complaining of severe headache and nausea. She had had dizziness and unsteady gait for the previous two weeks. She did not complain of hearing disturbance, but otological examination revealed sensorineural deafness. She had no facial palsy. Skull x-ray showed no erosion of the internal auditory canal. Plain CT-scan revealed a large, unenhanced, low-density mass in the right c-p angle cistern. At the time of the operation, this tumor originated from the right facial nerve. Histological diagnosis of this tumor was schwannoma. After the operation, right facial nerve palsy appeared but hardness of hearing was no worse than previously. This tumor seemed to be facial nerve neurinoma in the c-p angle cistern. To the present, 121 facial nerve neurinomas have been reported in the previous literature. Facial nerve neurinomas in the c-p angle cistern, however, have only been reported in 5 cases. The most frequent symptom of facial nerve neurinoma in the temporal bone is facial nerve palsy, but that of facial nerve neurinoma in the c-p angle cistern is hearing loss, as in an acoustic neurinoma. Preoperative diagnosis of facial neurinoma in the c-p angle cistern using neurological symptoms alone is difficult. Furthermore, differential diagnosis from acoustic neurinoma in the c-p angle cistern using only skull x-rays and CT-scanning is also difficult.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
