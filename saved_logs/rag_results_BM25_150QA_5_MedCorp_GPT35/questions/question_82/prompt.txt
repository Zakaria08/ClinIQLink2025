Document 1 (Title: Intracranial aneurysm): Subarachnoid bleed If an aneurysm ruptures, blood leaks into the space around the brain. This is called a subarachnoid hemorrhage. Onset is usually sudden without prodrome, classically presenting as a "thunderclap headache" worse than previous headaches. Symptoms of a subarachnoid hemorrhage differ depending on the site and size of the aneurysm. Symptoms of a ruptured aneurysm can include: a sudden severe headache that can last from several hours to days nausea and vomiting drowsiness, confusion and/or loss of consciousness visual abnormalities meningism dizziness Almost all aneurysms rupture at their apex. This leads to hemorrhage in the subarachnoid space and sometimes in brain parenchyma. Minor leakage from aneurysm may precede rupture, causing warning headaches. About 60% of patients die immediately after rupture. Larger aneurysms have a greater tendency to rupture, though most ruptured aneurysms are less than 10 mm in diameter.
Document 2 (Title: Clinical features and outcome in 68 cases of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage without aneurysm repair--a community hospital study.): The authors studied the clinical features and outcome at 6 months in 191 patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) from ruptured aneurysms. Aneurysm repair (AR) was undertaken in 123 cases (64.4%). In the non-AR group (n = 68), 48.5% of the patients were 70 years of age or older, compared with 12.2% in the AR group. The duration from onset to admission was less than 3 hours in 48 non-AR cases (70.6%) and in 42 AR cases (34.1%). Among non-AR patients, 63.2% were Hunt and Hess grade IV or V, whereas the figure for AR patients was only 14.7%. By 6 months after SAH, 94.1% of non-AR patients had died, and the remainder were vegetative or severely disabled. In contrast, only 15.4% in the AR group died, and over 50% showed good recovery. The large majority of non-AR patients were treated conservatively because they were judged to be poor surgical risks and, among these patients, nearly one half were elderly. In the 10 elderly patients considered good surgical candidates, vasospasm was the most common reason (70%) for not performing AR.
Document 3 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): The impact of age on risk was present across all operations but had most impact in liver and rectal surgery. Surgeons are challenged to decide whether major sur-gery is justified in older adult patients, especially those with limited life expectancy. Effectiveness of oncologic surgery in older adult patients depends on whether a cure can be achieved safely without compromise to functional status or quality of life. Postoperative life expectancy should be improved by surgery, or, at the very least, not diminished.Emergency SurgeryEmergent surgery caries exceptionally high risk for older adult patients. In an analysis of patients age 90 years and older, 90-day mortality after emergency gastrointestinal procedures was 54%.71 In a large cohort of patients undergoing endovas-cular repair for ruptured aortic aneurysm, 30-day mortality was 35% after primary aortic repair and 52% after open conversion of endovascular aortic repair.72Frail institutionalized elders are at substantial risk for
Document 4 (Title: Intracranial Hemorrhage -- Etiology -- Subarachnoid Hemorrhage): A subarachnoid hemorrhage refers to bleeding into the subarachnoid space. Subarachnoid hemorrhage is divided into traumatic versus non-traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage. A second categorization divides subarachnoid hemorrhage into an aneurysmal and non-aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage occurs after the rupture of a cerebral aneurysm. Non-aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage is bleeding into the subarachnoid space without identifiable aneurysms. Non-aneurysmal subarachnoid bleeding most commonly occurs after trauma with a blunt head injury with or without penetrating trauma or sudden acceleration changes to the head. [7]
Document 5 (Title: Subarachnoid Hemorrhage -- Epidemiology): Most aSAH occur between 40 and 60 years of age, and young children and older adults can be affected. [22] The mean age of aneurysmal rupture ranges from 50-55 years. [23] It is more prevalent in the Blacks and Hispanic populations than the white Americans. [22] There is a slightly higher incidence of aneurysmal SAH in females, which may be related to their hormonal status. [23] Patients with a history of smoking and previously ruptured intracerebral aneurysm are highly associated with new subarachnoid hemorrhage.
