        "content": "Subarachnoid bleed If an aneurysm ruptures, blood leaks into the space around the brain. This is called a subarachnoid hemorrhage. Onset is usually sudden without prodrome, classically presenting as a \"thunderclap headache\" worse than previous headaches. Symptoms of a subarachnoid hemorrhage differ depending on the site and size of the aneurysm. Symptoms of a ruptured aneurysm can include: a sudden severe headache that can last from several hours to days nausea and vomiting drowsiness, confusion and/or loss of consciousness visual abnormalities meningism dizziness Almost all aneurysms rupture at their apex. This leads to hemorrhage in the subarachnoid space and sometimes in brain parenchyma. Minor leakage from aneurysm may precede rupture, causing warning headaches. About 60% of patients die immediately after rupture. Larger aneurysms have a greater tendency to rupture, though most ruptured aneurysms are less than 10 mm in diameter.",

        "content": "The authors studied the clinical features and outcome at 6 months in 191 patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) from ruptured aneurysms. Aneurysm repair (AR) was undertaken in 123 cases (64.4%). In the non-AR group (n = 68), 48.5% of the patients were 70 years of age or older, compared with 12.2% in the AR group. The duration from onset to admission was less than 3 hours in 48 non-AR cases (70.6%) and in 42 AR cases (34.1%). Among non-AR patients, 63.2% were Hunt and Hess grade IV or V, whereas the figure for AR patients was only 14.7%. By 6 months after SAH, 94.1% of non-AR patients had died, and the remainder were vegetative or severely disabled. In contrast, only 15.4% in the AR group died, and over 50% showed good recovery. The large majority of non-AR patients were treated conservatively because they were judged to be poor surgical risks and, among these patients, nearly one half were elderly. In the 10 elderly patients considered good surgical candidates, vasospasm was the most common reason (70%) for not performing AR.",
