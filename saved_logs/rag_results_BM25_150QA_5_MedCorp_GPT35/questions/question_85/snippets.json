For patients between 21\u00a0and 24, repeat Pap smear in 1 year if the status of the HPV is positive or unknown. It is also acceptable to perform a reflex HPV test on the same pap smear sample. HPV status will determine future pap smear frequencies. If HPV is negative, then the patient is recommended for follow-up in 3 years. If the follow-up Pap smear continues to show ASC-US, then an additional Pap smear in 1 year is recommended. For patients between 25\u00a0and 29, screening is still the same if they have negative HPV. However, if they have positive HPV, colposcopy is recommended instead of waiting one year for a follow-up pap smear. If at the follow-up pap smear, ASC-US is still present, the next step is colposcopy. For patients between 30 to 65 years of age, there is a more significant concern for the progression of cervical cancer. If ASC-US is documented on a pap smear and they are HPV negative, they will follow the same process as the other age groups. If HPV status is positive or unknown, then a repeat pap smear is recommended within four months.",

        "content": "Although hyperkeratosis is a common cytological finding on Papanicolaou smear, its clinical significance is unclear. A profile of patients with hyperkeratosis was constructed by comparing them to an age-matched control population having normal Papanicolaou smears. The clinical significance of hyperkeratosis was evaluated and appropriate follow-up studies were recommended. Of 2198 Papanicolaou smears done in the University of Kansas Family Practice Department between October 1, 1988, and October 31, 1989, there were 184 diagnoses of hyperkeratosis from smears on which no other pathological findings were noted. Charts of 183 of these patients with hyperkeratosis were reviewed and compared with an age-matched control population having normal Papanicolaou smears. Patients with hyperkeratosis had a statistically higher incidence of infections with Gardnerella vaginalis, but a lower incidence of infections with Chlamydia trachomatis. Diaphragm use was more prevalent in the group with hyperkeratosis. The incidence of inflammation on Papanicolaou smear was similar between the two groups. Of the patients with hyperkeratosis, colposcopic examination had been performed on 48% (88 of 183), of which 28% (25 of 88) had evidence of human papillomavirus or dysplasia. Review of the data obtained suggests that follow-up colposcopy, including endocervical curettage, be performed on all patients with hyperkeratosis in order to screen for accompanying pathological conditions that may necessitate treatment.",

Effectiveness The Pap test, when combined with a regular program of screening and appropriate follow-up, can reduce cervical cancer deaths by up to 80%. Failure of prevention of cancer by the Pap test can occur for many reasons, including not getting regular screening, lack of appropriate follow-up of abnormal results, and sampling and interpretation errors. In the US, over half of all invasive cancers occur in females who have never had a Pap smear; an additional 10 to 20% of cancers occur in those who have not had a Pap smear in the preceding five years. About one-quarter of US cervical cancers were in people who had an abnormal Pap smear but did not get appropriate follow-up (patient did not return for care, or clinician did not perform recommended tests or treatment).",
