Document 1 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): ETs exert widespread actions in the body. In particular, they cause potent dose-dependent vasoconstriction in most vascular beds. Intravenous administration of ET-1 causes a rapid and transient decrease in arterial blood pressure followed by a sustained increase. The depressor response results from release of prostacyclin and nitric oxide from the vascular endothelium, whereas the pressor response is due to direct contraction of vascular smooth muscle. ETs also exert direct positive inotropic and chronotropic actions on the heart and are potent coronary vasoconstrictors. They act on the kidneys to cause vasoconstriction and decrease glomerular filtration rate and sodium and water excretion. In the respiratory system, they cause potent contraction of tracheal and bronchial smooth muscle. ETs interact with several endocrine systems, increasing the secretion of renin, aldosterone, AVP, and ANP. They exert a variety of actions on the central and peripheral nervous systems, the
Document 2 (Title: Angiotensin II receptor type 1): Angiotensin II receptor type 1 or AT1 receptor is the best characterized angiotensin receptor. It has vasopressor effects and regulates aldosterone secretion. It is an important effector controlling blood pressure and volume in the cardiovascular system. Angiotensin II receptor antagonists are drugs indicated for hypertension, diabetic nephropathy and congestive heart failure. Function The AT1 receptor mediates the major cardiovascular effects of angiotensin II. Effects include vasoconstriction, aldosterone synthesis and secretion, increased vasopressin secretion, cardiac hypertrophy, augmentation of peripheral noradrenergic activity, vascular smooth muscle cells proliferation, decreased renal blood flow, renal renin inhibition, renal tubular sodium reuptake, modulation of central sympathetic nervous system activity, cardiac contractility, central osmocontrol and extracellular matrix formation.

Document 3 (Title: Dopamine inhibits corticosteroid secretion from frog adrenal gland, in vitro.): The effect of dopamine on corticosteroid secretion from frog interrenal (adrenal) tissue was investigated in vitro using a perifusion system technique. Administration of graded concentrations of dopamine (5 X 10(-8) M to 10(-3) M) to interrenal slices induced a dose-dependent inhibition of steroid secretion. The half-maximal effective dose of dopamine was 7 X 10(-6) M for corticosterone and 4 X 10(-6) M for aldosterone. Noradrenaline and adrenaline were also able to elicit a dose-related inhibition of steroid release, but these catecholamines were approximately 100 and 2000 times less potent than dopamine in our model. Administration of repeated pulses of dopamine (5 X 10(-5) M), at 150-min intervals, led to a reproducible inhibition of corticosteroid secretion without any desensitization phenomenon. Similarly, prolonged infusion of dopamine (5 X 10(-6) M) caused a sustained inhibition of steroidogenesis. The inhibitory action of dopamine was also observed using enzymatically dispersed adrenal cells, indicating that dopamine exerts a direct effect on adrenocortical cells. After the second pulse, dopamine also induced a transient stimulation of steroid secretion from acutely dispersed cells. Administration of short pulses of apomorphine (5 X 10(-5) M) induced a transient inhibition of corticosteroid secretion, and the kinetics of the response were very similar to that observed with dopamine. During prolonged administration of dopamine, the steroidogenic actions of ACTH (10(-9) M) and serotonin (5 X 10(-6) M) were not altered. In contrast, dopamine induced a marked inhibition of angiotensin II-evoked corticosteroid secretion. Taken together, these results show that the neurotransmitter dopamine exerts a direct inhibitory effect on steroid secretion from frog adrenocortical cells. Our results also indicate that dopamine and angiotensin II likely act through a common intracellular pathway. These data suggest that dopamine, released by chromaffin cells during neurogenic stress, may modulate the response of adrenocortical cells through a paracrine mode of communication.
Document 4 (Title: Aliskiren (Archived) -- Mechanism of Action): Aliskiren is active in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). [11] Renin secretion occurs by specialized cells found in the juxtaglomerular apparatus within the kidney based on changes in blood volume and renal perfusion as sensed by the macula densa in the distal tubule of the nephron. Renin is responsible for converting angiotensinogen to angiotensin I. Angiotensin I is then converted to angiotensin II by the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), which is present in the lungs' capillaries and endothelial cells in the kidneys. Angiotensin II is believed to be the first active mediator in the RAAS system and exerts its effects by binding to the AT1 receptor and works as a vasoconstrictor, causing the release of catecholamines and promoting aldosterone secretion and sodium reabsorption. These effects together act to increase blood pressure. Angiotensin II also can inhibit renin release, causing negative feedback to the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.
Document 5 (Title: Angiotensin II receptor): Mechanism The angiotensin receptor is activated by the vasoconstricting peptide angiotensin II. The activated receptor in turn couples to Gq/11 and Gi/o and thus activates phospholipase C and increases the cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations, which in turn triggers cellular responses such as stimulation of protein kinase C. Activated receptor also inhibits adenylate cyclase and activates various tyrosine kinases. Effects Effects mediated by the AT1 receptor include vasoconstriction, aldosterone synthesis and secretion, increased vasopressin secretion, cardiac hypertrophy, augmentation of peripheral noradrenergic activity, vascular smooth muscle cells proliferation, decreased renal blood flow, renal renin inhibition, renal tubular sodium reuptake, modulation of central sympathetic nervous system activity, cardiac contractility, central osmocontrol and extracellular matrix formation.
