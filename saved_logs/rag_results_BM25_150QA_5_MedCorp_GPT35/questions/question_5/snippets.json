Oral manifestations In the case of severe deficiency, there may be spontaneous gingival bleeding, ecchymosis, and epistaxis. Symptoms of VWD include postoperative bleeding, bleeding after dental extraction, gingival bleeding, epistaxis and easy bruising. The intake of oral contraceptives as the first-line treatment for menorrhagia may lead to gingival enlargement and bleeding in women. Platelet or coagulation disorders with severely altered hemostasis can cause spontaneous gingival bleeding, as seen in conjunction with hyperplastic hyperemic gingival enlargements in leukemic patients. Deposition of hemosiderin and other blood degradation products on the tooth surfaces turning them brown can occur with continuous oral bleeding over long periods.",

        "content": "A Case of delivery in a 23-year-old woman after a prophylactic infusion of DDAVP is described. She had a life-long history of easy bruising and frequent epistaxis, with the diagnosis of vWD being made when she was 14 years old. A hemostatic examination showed a prolonged bleeding time, a moderate reduction in the factor VIII level (VIII: C) and von Willebrand Factor Antigen (vWF: Ag), decreased platelet aggregation by ristocetin, and depletion of platelet retention. In April, 1988, in the 34th week of pregnancy, she was admitted to our clinic in order to avoid abnormal bleeding during labor. On admission, the level of factor VIII, ristocetin aggregation, and platelet retention were normal, but the bleeding time remained prolonged. The diagnosis of vWD type I was made on the normal multimeric structure. The DDAVP infusion test revealed a shortening of the bleeding time and an increase in the vWF: Ag. In the 41st week of pregnancy, labor was induced, accompanied by infusion of DDAVP, she gave birth to an infant without any abnormal bleeding. Since conventional treatments with human plasma derivatives may cause complicating viral infections, we propose the infusion of DDAVP is one of the treatments to prevent the abnormal bleeding of the patient with vWD during labor.",

        "content": "We have experienced a case of fulminant malignant hyperthermia who was a 63-year-old female weighing 44 kg. There was no particular past history nor family history. She underwent right mastoidectomy because of chronic otitis media. Her preoperative physical status was ASA I. She was premedicated with diazepam 10 mg and loxatigine 75 mg P.O. The induction was done with thiamylal 200 mg IV and fentanyl 0.1 mg IV followed by vecuronium 6 mg IV for endotracheal intubation. Intubation was easy and uneventful. Anesthesia was maintained with nitrous oxide 3 l.min-1, oxygen 3 l.min-1 and enflurane 2.0%. Seventy min after the induction of anesthesia, arterial blood gas analysis showed severe respiratory acidosis (PCO2: 63.2 mmHg, pH: 7.27) and it was improved with manual hyperventilation at that time. Pulse rate increased from 80 to 115 b.p.m. 20 minutes later. Then, the patient was ventilated with 100% oxygen, and anesthetic circuits and machine were exchanged for new units. Surgery was postponed. Muscle stiffness of upper extremities was observed and her temperature increased to a maximum of 38.9 degrees C. Surface cooling was started and dantrolene sodium 60 mg and furosemide 20 mg were given intravenously. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit, and clinical signs improved gradually within one hour. Serum enzymes; CPK, LDH, GOT and GPT increased on the first postoperative day. On the 11 th postoperative day skeletal muscle biopsy was done under local anesthesia with 1% procaine and Ca-induced Ca-release rate test revealed positive for enflurane. This is the oldest patient of malignant hyperthermia reported in Japan.",
