        "content": "Thyroglossal-duct cysts usually present as an anterior midline neck mass, ranking first in this location in the pediatric age. We have carried out a retrospective revision of 52 pediatric patients with a preoperative diagnosis of thyroglossal-duct cyst. All of them were treated in our surgical unit between 1982 and 1989. The male to female ratio of cases was 34:18 with symptoms appearing at an average age of 4 years. The most frequent clinical presentation was that of a cystic mass without any inflammatory signs (65%), located in the mid-line at the hyoid level (75%). In this paper we analyze the existing possibilities as regards to the clinical presentation, location and characteristics of this type of cervical swellings, as well as the most frequent causes of misdiagnosis. We also make a comparison between the results we have obtained with the different surgical techniques used. We conclude that it is necessary to perform a radical surgical treatment of the thyroglossal-duct remnants, which includes removal of the middle third of the hyoid bone and excision of the thyroglossal duct as far as the foramen cecum.",

Cystic metastatic lymph nodes usually originate from either papillary thyroid carcinomas or squamous cell carcinomas of the upper aerodigestive tract. Dermoid or epidermoid cysts can also be midline cystic neck masses. The close relationship of thyroglossal duct cysts with the hyoid bone is a key feature for differentiation. However, the final differentiation is often not made until pathologic diagnosis. Second branchial cleft cysts are also anterior neck cystic masses.
