        "content": "The authors present eight cases of Fournier's gangrene treated from 1987 to 1989 (3 years). There was no discernable cause for 5 patients (62.5%). Immediate aggressive surgical debridement of all necrotic tissue was performed. Intravenous antibiotics and resuscitation fluid and hyperbaric oxygenation were also administered to all patients. Skin grafting was performed for 4 patients (40%), 3 weeks after surgical debridement. One patient died (12.5%) and 2 subsequently developed an urethral stricture. Etiology, treatment and outcome of Fournier's gangrene are discussed and the results of the study are compared to other studies. This disease is still serious, its pathogenesis is not completely elucidated, but when immediate adequate treatment is performed, the outcome is generally favourable.",

        "content": "Fournier gangrene is a recognized side effect of SGLT2 inhibitors (canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and empagliflozin), which increase the excretion of glucose in the urine. Diagnosis Fournier gangrene is usually diagnosed clinically, but laboratory tests and imaging studies are used to confirm diagnosis, determine severity, and predict outcomes. X-rays and ultrasounds may show the presence of gas below the surface of the skin. A CT scan can be useful in determining the site of origin and extent of spread.",
