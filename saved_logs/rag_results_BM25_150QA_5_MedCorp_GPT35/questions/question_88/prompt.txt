Document 1 (Title: Refractive surgery): Transepithelial photorefractive keratectomy (TransPRK) is a laser-assisted eye surgery to correct refraction errors of human eye cornea. It employs excimer laser to ablate outer layer of cornea, epithelium, as well its connective tissue, stroma, to correct eye optical power. Laser Assisted Sub-Epithelium Keratomileusis (LASEK) is a procedure that also changes the shape of the cornea using an excimer laser to ablate the tissue from the corneal stroma, under the corneal epithelium, which is kept mostly intact to act as a natural bandage. The surgeon uses an alcohol solution to loosen then lift a thin layer of the epithelium with a trephine blade (usually with a thickness of 50 micrometres). During the weeks following LASEK, the epithelium heals, leaving no permanent flap in the cornea. This healing process can involve discomfort comparable to that with PRK.
Document 2 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): developments in Excimer laser technology have led to increased optimism regarding the ability to safely deliver laser energy. Excimer laser atherectomy approved by the FDA for peripheral artery intervention employs precision laser energy control (shallow tissue penetration) and safer wavelengths (ultraviolet as opposed to the infrared spectra in older laser technology), which decrease perforation and thermal injury to the treated vessels.A laser atherectomy catheter, with diameters varying from 0.9 to 2.5 mm, is tracked over the guidewire to the desired tar-get. Once activated, the Excimer laser uses ultraviolet energy to ablate the lesion and create a nonthrombogenic arterial lumen. This lumen is further dilated by an angioplasty balloon. Because the Excimer laser can potentially reduce the rate of distal embo-lization by evaporating the lesion, it may be used as an adjunct tool for ostial lesions and lesions that can be traversed by a wire but not an angioplasty balloon
Document 3 (Title: Photorefractive Keratectomy -- Anatomy and Physiology): Laser refractive surgeries act upon the surface of the cornea, the transparent, dome-shaped, outermost layer that covers the front of the eye. The first step of PRK requires complete removal of the superficial corneal epithelium down to Bowman’s layer. The excimer laser then ablates the stroma, thereby remodeling the corneal surface. Further information regarding the excimer laser follows below. Following the procedure, re-epithelialization occurs via the migration of fibroblasts and collagen synthesis. [2]
Document 4 (Title: [Wound healing of the cornea of New World monkeys after surface keratectomy: Er:YAG-excimer laser].): Corneal wound healing was studied after photoablation with an excimer laser (193 nm, 43 pulses at 180 mJ/cm2 [symbol: see text] 11 microns ablation depth, optical zone 2.0 mm) and with an erbium-YAG laser (2.94 microns, 5 pulses at 2.5 J/cm2 [symbol: see text] 50 microns ablation depth, optical zone 1.6 mm). The corneas of marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) were prepared 5 and 10 days and 4 and 25 weeks after photoablation. The sections were investigated by conventional light microscopy or exposed to antibodies against collagen types I, III, IV, VII and laminin and stained by indirect immunofluorescence. Macroscopically, the time-course of wound healing was comparable to that seen, after laser keratomileusis for correction of myopia in humans (epithelium closure after 24-48 h, subepithelial haze: erbium-YAG less than or equal to excimer). Histologically the time-course of wound healing could be schematically divided into three phases: (1) epithelial hyperplasia, inhomogeneous new synthesis of collagen fibrils subepithelially; (2) reorganization of the epithelium, hyperplasia of keratocytes, incipient reorganization of the collagen fibrils, increase in subepithelial haze; (3) reorganization of the collagen fibrils, decrease in subepithelial haze. The distribution of collagen type VII during the corneal wound healing suggests that the subepithelial haze observed during the healing process after laser keratomileusis for correction of myopia is based on the anchoring fibrils of the basement membrane.
Document 5 (Title: Wound healing after excimer laser keratomileusis (photorefractive keratectomy) in monkeys.): Laser myopic keratomileusis (photorefractive keratectomy) was performed on 29 rhesus monkey corneas with an argon fluoride (193-nm) excimer laser and a computer-controlled, moving slit delivery system. The 4-mm-diameter central ablation zone ranged in depth from 11 microns (-2 diopters effect) to 46 microns (-8 diopters effect). Corneas were studied for the 9 months postoperatively by clinical slit-lamp microscopy, and periodically with light and transmission electron microscopy. By 6 weeks, mild to moderate subepithelial haze was apparent in 93% of the corneas, with considerable variability in density. Progressive clearing occurred so that by 6 to 9 months 12 of 13 surviving corneas (92%) were either completely clear (4 corneas) or trace hazy (8 corneas). The epithelium was thickened at 21 days after ablation and returned to normal thickness by 3 months. At 3 weeks, subepithelial fibroblasts were three times the density of normal keratocytes and returned to nearly normal numbers by 9 months. We concluded that the anterior monkey cornea demonstrated a mild, typical wound healing response after excimer laser keratomileusis.
