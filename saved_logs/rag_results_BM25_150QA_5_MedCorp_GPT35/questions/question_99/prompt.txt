Document 1 (Title: Hormone Replacement Therapy -- Indications -- Testosterone therapy indications): The addition of testosterone supplementation to menopausal HRT can be beneficial for women with female sexual interest and arousal disorder after other causes have been excluded and a trial of conventional HRT has been given. Currently, no FDA-approved testosterone product for women in the US is available. However, transdermal testosterone therapy at a dose suitable for postmenopausal women may enhance sexual desire, arousal, orgasm, and overall pleasure, keeping in mind that no specific level of any androgen is diagnostic of hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD). Per the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition ( DSM-5 ), published in 2022, HSDD is included in and referred to as female sexual arousal and interest disorder (FSAID). [16] Testosterone gel or cream formulations should be applied to clean, dry skin on the lower abdomen or upper thighs. The hands should be washed immediately after application, and contact with others should be avoided until the product is completely dry. The area should not be washed for 2 to 3 hours postapplication. [8] [17]
Document 2 (Title: Sexual desire): Hormones Sexual desire is said to be influenced by androgens in men and by both androgens and estrogens in women. Many studies associate the sex hormone testosterone with sexual desire. Another hormone thought to influence sexual desire is oxytocin. Exogenous administration of moderate amounts of oxytocin has been found to stimulate females to desire and seek out sexual activity. In women, oxytocin levels are at their highest during sexual activity. In males, the frequency of ejaculation affects libido. If roughly a week passes between ejaculations, there will be a stronger desire for sexual activity. Interventions Medical interventions are available for individuals who feel sexually bored, experience performance anxiety, or are unable to orgasm. For everyday life, a 2013 fact sheet from the Association for Reproductive Health Professionals recommends erotic literature and recalling instances when one felt sexy and sexual.

Document 3 (Title: Gynecology_Novak): Breast Cancer Sexual dysfunction following breast cancer treatment is likely to persist more than 1 year after diagnosis of breast cancer (63). Chemotherapy appears to be responsible for most of the resulting sexual difficulties, including loss of desire, subjective arousal, vaginal dryness, and dyspareunia (64). A small study of women with past breast cancer and complex endocrine status resulting from ongoing antiestrogen therapy found that, whereas relationship factors predicted desire, history of chemotherapy predicted disorders of arousal lubrication, orgasm, and dyspareunia but there was no connection between sexual function and androgen levels including androgen metabolites (65). A model for predicting sexual interest, function, and satisfaction after breast cancer has evolved from two large independent groups of breast cancer survivors (64). The most important predictors of sexual health were absence of vaginal dryness, presence of emotional well-being, positive body image,
Document 4 (Title: Oral contraceptives, androgens, and the sexuality of young women: II. The role of androgens.): The relationships between plasma free testosterone (FT) and measures of sexual attitude, sexual behavior, and gender role behavior were assessed in 55 oral contraceptive-using and 53 nonusing female undergraduates. Plasma FT and other measures of androgenicity were substantially lower in the oral contraceptive (OC) group. Correlations between FT and certain behavioral and attitudinal measures were found in the OC users but not the nonusers. In the OC users, FT was positively associated with frequency of sexual intercourse but not with frequency of masturbation. It was negatively associated with restrictive sexual morality. Correlations between FT and measures of gender role behavior were negligible, and FT was unrelated to proceptivity, homosexual interest, or the use of sexual fantasy. The occurrence of some predicted correlations among pill-using women but not the nonusers requires explanation, particularly in view of the substantially lower levels of FT in the pill-using group. It is suggested that androgen-behavior relationships in women are easily obscured by psychosocial influences and in this sample of young women such influences may have been more powerful among those not using OCs. Such psychosocial influences are likely to differ at different stages of women's life cycles. The importance of controlling for such influences in any study of hormone-sexual behavior relationships in women is emphasized, and the need for prospective studies of women before and after starting on steroidal contraception is recognized.
Document 5 (Title: Sexual desire, general arousability, and sexual dysfunction.): To determine the interrelationships among neuroticism, general arousability, sexual desire, and sexual dysfunction in women, two studies were conducted. The first found a significant positive correlation between general arousability and neuroticism. The second found a curvilinear relationship between general arousability and sexual dysfunction, and a negative correlation between levels of sexual desire and sexual dysfunction. Implications for therapy with sexually dysfunctional women are discussed.
