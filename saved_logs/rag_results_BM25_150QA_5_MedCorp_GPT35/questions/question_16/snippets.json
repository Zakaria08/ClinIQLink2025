He has a history of hyper-tension and coronary artery disease with symptoms of stable angina. He can walk only half a block before pain in his legs forces him to stop. He has a 50-pack-year smoking history but stopped 2 years ago. Medications include atenolol, atorvastatin, and hydrochlorothiazide. The nurse in the preoperative holding area obtains the following vital signs: temperature 36.8\u00b0C (98.2\u00b0F), blood pressure 168/100 mm Hg, heart rate 78 bpm, oxygen saturation by pulse oximeter 96% while breathing room air, and pain 5/10 in the right lower leg after walking into the hospital. What anesthetic agents will you choose for his anesthetic plan? Why? Does the choice of anesthetic make a difference?",

        "content": "Signs and symptoms The signs and symptoms of peripheral artery disease are based on the part of the body that is affected. About 66% of patients affected by PAD either do not have symptoms or have atypical symptoms. The most common presenting symptom is intermittent claudication, which causes pain and severe cramping when walking or exercising. The pain is usually located in the calf muscles of the affected leg and relieved by rest. This occurs because during exercise the muscles of the leg need more oxygen. Normally, the arteries would be able to increase the amount of blood flow and therefore increase the amount of oxygen going to the exercised leg. However, in PAD, the artery is unable to respond appropriately to the increased demand for oxygen by the muscles, as a result, the leg muscles are overly saturated with lactic acid, resulting in pain of the muscle that only goes away with rest. Other symptoms may include",

        "content": "A 21-year-old Thai man presented with progressive weakness and atrophy of both hands for 2 years. His left leg was atrophic and weak secondary to poliomyelitis since he was 8 months old. Physical examination showed that there was atrophy of both hands and forearms as well as left leg. Sensation was normal. Deep tendon reflexes were normal except for hyporeflexia of left leg. EMG showed chronic denervation pattern in the recent atrophic muscles and in normal power muscles. Motor and sensory nerve conductions were normal. Biopsy of forearm muscle revealed degeneration and fibrosis of muscle fibers. These findings were compatible with post-polio syndrome (PPS) which presents in patients with late paralysis following poliomyelitis. It is not a form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis although some clinical similarities exist. Weakness from PPS may lead to musculoskeletal pain and increased functional disability. Proper rehabilitation program is to maintain his functional status and allow him to continue to live as independently as possible by regular exercise without stressing joints and muscles.",
