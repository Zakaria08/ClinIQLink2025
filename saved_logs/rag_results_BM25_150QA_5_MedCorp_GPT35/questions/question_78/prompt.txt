Document 1 (Title: Quantification of adipose tissue by MRI: relationship with anthropometric variables.): This study had two objectives: 1) to establish magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a tool for measuring total and regional adipose tissue (AT) distribution in humans and 2) to assess the relationship between selected anthropometric variables and MRI-measured AT. Twenty-seven healthy men varying in age [40.8 +/- 14.5 (SD) yr], body mass index (28.5 +/- 4.8), and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR, 0.96 +/- 0.07) participated in the study. Total AT volume was determined using a linear interpolation of AT areas obtained on consecutive slices (n = 41) taken from head to toe (10-mm thickness, 50-mm centers). The mean change for repeated measures of total AT volume was 2.9% (range 0.9-4.3%). Large interindividual differences were observed for total AT volume (6.9-59.3 liters), subcutaneous AT (6.3-49.8 liters), and visceral AT (0.5-8.5 liters). Visceral AT represented 18.3% of the total AT. The single best predictor of total adiposity was waist circumference (R2 = 0.92). For visceral AT volume, WHR was the strongest anthropometric correlate (r = 0.85, P less than 0.01). When controlled for age and adiposity, however, WHR explained only 12% of the variation in absolute visceral AT and less than 1% of the variation in visceral-to-subcutaneous ratio. Age was a better predictor of visceral-to-subcutaneous ratio than level of adiposity or WHR. The results of this study demonstrate that MRI offers a reliable measure of regional and total AT distribution in humans and, thus, is of value as a research tool.
Document 2 (Title: Pathophysiology of Obesity -- Issues of Concern -- Obesity and Inflammatory Markers): Obesity is also referred to as chronic-low-grade inflammation or “metabolic inflammation,” which is often the focus in the pathogenesis of several diseases such as coronary artery disease, atherosclerosis, and insulin resistance. [21] [22] Adipose tissue is classified as a complex secretory organ that plays many roles in metabolism. This can modulate energy expenditure, appetite, insulin sensitivity, bone metabolism, reproductive and endocrine functions, inflammation, and immunity and act as a triacylglycerol reservoir. Visceral adiposity correlates well with an increased risk of CVD and diabetes compared to a high body mass index (BMI). [23] [24] However, the biochemical and physiologic reasons for having a better correlation of visceral adiposity are still unclear. One possible explanation is that visceral fat has direct access to the portal circulation compared to subcutaneous white adipose tissue, leading to the substances produced by visceral fat directly affecting the liver.
Document 3 (Title: Histology_Ross):  The epicardium, also known as the visceral layer of serous pericardium, adheres to the outer surface of the heart (Fig 13.6). It consists of a single layer of mesothelial cells and underlying connective and adipose tissue. The blood vessels and nerves that supply the heart lie in the epicardium and are surrounded by adipose tissue that cushions the heart in the pericardial cavity. The epicardium is reflected back at the great vessels entering and leaving the heart as the parietal layer of serous pericardium, which lines the inner surface of the pericardium that surrounds the heart and roots of great vessels. Thus, there is a potential space containing a minimal amount (15–50 ml) of serous (pericardial) fluid between the visceral and parietal layers of the serous pericardium. This space is known as the pericardial cavity; its lining consists of mesothelial cells (see Fig. 13.6). The condition in which excess ﬂuid (blood or pericardial effusion) rapidly accumulates in the pericardial
Document 4 (Title: Adipose tissue): An excess of visceral fat is known as central obesity, or "belly fat", in which the abdomen protrudes excessively. New developments such as the Body Volume Index (BVI) are specifically designed to measure abdominal volume and abdominal fat. Excess visceral fat is also linked to type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance, inflammatory diseases, and other obesity-related diseases. Likewise, the accumulation of neck fat (or cervical adipose tissue) has been shown to be associated with mortality. Several studies have suggested that visceral fat can be predicted from simple anthropometric measures, and predicts mortality more accurately than body mass index or waist circumference.
Document 5 (Title: Insulin Resistance -- Pathophysiology -- Adipose Tissue): Using the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp technique, researchers determined that lipolysis is sensitive to insulin. The failure of insulin to suppress lipolysis in insulin-resistant adipose tissue, especially visceral adipose tissue, increases circulating free fatty acids (FFAs). Higher levels of circulating FFAs directly affect both liver and muscle metabolism, further exacerbating insulin resistance in these tissues and contributing to lipotoxicity-induced beta-cell dysfunction.
