Document 1 (Title: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis): Signs and symptoms In many people, symptoms are present for a considerable time before diagnosis. The most common clinical features of IPF include the following: Age over 50 years Dry, non-productive cough on exertion Progressive exertional dyspnea (shortness of breath with exercise) Dry, inspiratory bibasilar "velcro-like" crackles on auscultation (a crackling sound in the lungs during inhalation similar to Velcro being torn apart slowly, heard with a stethoscope). Clubbing of the digits, a disfigurement of the finger tips or toes (see image) Abnormal pulmonary function test results, with evidence of restriction and impaired gas exchange. Some of these features are due to chronic hypoxemia (oxygen deficiency in the blood), are not specific for IPF, and can occur in other pulmonary disorders. IPF should be considered in all patients with unexplained chronic exertional dyspnea who present with cough, inspiratory bibasilar crackles, or finger clubbing.
Document 2 (Title: Case Study: 33-Year-Old Female Presents with Chronic SOB and Cough (Archived) -- Case Presentation): History of Present Illness: A 33-year-old white female presents after admission to the general medical/surgical hospital ward with a chief complaint of shortness of breath on exertion. She reports that she was seen for similar symptoms previously at her primary care physician’s office six months ago. At that time, she was diagnosed with acute bronchitis and treated with bronchodilators, empiric antibiotics, and a short course oral steroid taper. This management did not improve her symptoms, and she has gradually worsened over six months. She reports a 20-pound (9 kg) intentional weight loss over the past year. She denies camping, spelunking, or hunting activities. She denies any sick contacts. A brief review of systems is negative for fever, night sweats, palpitations, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, neural sensation changes, muscular changes, and increased bruising or bleeding. She admits a cough, shortness of breath, and shortness of breath on exertion.
Document 3 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): James L. Zehnder, MD and edema and is tender to touch. Oxygen saturation by fingertip pulse oximeter while breathing room air is 87% (normal > 90%). Ultrasound reveals a deep vein thrombosis in the left lower extremity; chest computed tomography scan confirms the presence of pulmonary emboli. Laboratory blood tests indicate elevated d-dimer levels. What therapy is indicated acutely? What are the long-term therapy options? How long should she be treated? Should this indi-vidual use oral contraceptives? A 25-year-old woman presents to the emergency depart-ment complaining of acute onset of shortness of breath and pleuritic pain. She had been in her usual state of health until 2 days prior when she noted that her left leg was swollen and red. Her only medication was oral contraceptives. Family history was significant for a history of “blood clots” in mul-tiple members of the maternal side of her family. Physical examination demonstrates an anxious woman with stable vital signs.

Document 4 (Title: Malnutrition in a compulsive runner: a case conference.): A 28-yr-old, female marathon and "fitness" runner presented with leg swelling, fatigue, and loss of endurance. She was running an hour or more daily in addition to regular biking and swimming. She was an instructor in a fitness center. For 2 months prior to her leg swelling, she had increased fatigue and decreased exercise tolerance. She had been seen previously for a slow healing hamstring strain. She had not had a menstrual period for over 2 yr and had refused evaluation. She admitted to very low dietary intake, which she had always denied. She was worried about her body fat. She denied recent blood loss, diuretic or cathartic use, and induced vomiting. She appeared malnourished, pale, and older than her stated age. Her weight was 41.4 kg. Her blood pressure was 90/60, and her pulse was 100 per minute. She had pitting edema of the lower extremities to the knees. The diagnosis of anorexia nervosa was made and will be discussed.
Document 5 (Title: [A case of elderly (83-year-old) woman with possible left atrial myxoma].): A 78-year-old woman with exertional dyspnea (Hugh-Jones Grade III) and dry cough was admitted to our hospital in April, 1983. She had marked cardiac cachexia and a loss of body weight due to long term heart failure. On physical examination a systolic ejection murmur and a diastolic rumbling murmur were heard without the opening snap sound. Chest radiography revealed pleural effusion and cardiomegaly. M-mode and two dimensional echocardiography demonstrated abnormal echoes in the left atrium, the density being 22.7 Hounsfield Unit. Radionuclide angiography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provided similar findings. No other mass lesion existed in the other chambers. Based on these findings, the mass was diagnosed as a left atrial myxoma. She has been well except for periodic congestive heart failure, for about five years since her discharge. The course of her ailment is interesting because her treatment is mainly symptomatic.

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
Question: A 43-year-old woman presents to the emergency department complaining of palpitations, dry cough, and shortness of breath for 1 week. She immigrated to the United States from Korea at the age of 20. She says that her heart is racing and she has never felt these symptoms before. Her cough is dry and is associated with shortness of breath that occurs with minimal exertion. Her past medical history is otherwise unremarkable. She has no allergies and is not currently taking any medications. She is a nonsmoker and an occasional drinker. She denies illicit drug use. Her blood pressure is 100/65 mm Hg, pulse is 76/min, respiratory rate is 23/min, and temperature is 36.8°C (98.2°F). Her physical examination is significant for bibasilar lung crackles and a non-radiating, low-pitched, mid-diastolic rumbling murmur best heard at the apical region. In addition, she has jugular vein distention and bilateral pitting edema in her lower extremities. Which of the following best describes the infectious agent that led to this patient’s condition?
Options:
A. A bacterium that induces partial lysis of red cells with hydrogen peroxide
B. A bacterium that induces complete lysis of the red cells of a blood agar plate with an oxygen-sensitive cytotoxin
C. A bacterium that induces heme degradation of the red cells of a blood agar plate
D. A bacterium that requires an anaerobic environment to grow properly
