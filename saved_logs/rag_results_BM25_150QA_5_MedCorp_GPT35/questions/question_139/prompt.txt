Document 1 (Title: Sultamicillin versus trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole in the treatment of urinary tract infections.): Sultamicillin, a novel compound in which ampicillin and the beta-lactamase inhibitor sulbactam are linked as a double ester, was compared with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole with regard to in vitro activity, therapeutic efficacy and safety in the treatment of UTIs. The MICs of ampicillin and ampicillin in combination with sulbactam (10 micrograms), trimethoprim and trimethoprim in combination with sulfamethoxazole (1:19) were determined for 400 isolates causing UTI using an agar dilution technique (multipointer, cfu = 10(4]. The organisms isolated consisted of about one-third E. coli, one-third other Gram-negative strains and one-third Gram-positive strains. About half of the Gram-positive strains were enterococci and the other half staphylococci. A concentration of 8 micrograms/ml ampicillin inhibited 76% of the isolates while ampicillin in combination with sulbactam inhibited 86%. A concentration of 4 micrograms/ml trimethoprim inhibited 77% of the isolates, while trimethoprim in combination with sulfamethoxazole inhibited 83%. In a prospectively randomized clinical trial, 38 patients with UTI were treated orally with either sultamicillin (375 mg) or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (160 mg/800 mg) twice daily for 7 d. Sultamicillin eradicated bacteriuria during therapy and up to 1 to 2 weeks after therapy in 63% and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole in 50% of evaluable patients. Side effects were reported for 2 sultamicillin (gastric pain, diarrhea) and 2 trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole patients (gastric pain, exanthema), with the latter 2 being withdrawn after 6 days of therapy. Sultamicillin appeared as effective and safe as trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole in the treatment of UTI.
Document 2 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): Phenytoin: [P] Decreased phenytoin metabolism. See also Alcohol; Anticoagulants, oral. Ampicillin: [NP] Interruption of enterohepatic circulation of estrogen; possible reduction in oral contraceptive efficacy. Some other oral antibiotics may have a similar effect. Bexarotene: [P] Increased estrogen metabolism, possible reduction in oral contraceptive efficacy. Bosentan: [NP] Enzyme induction leading to reduced estrogen effect. Corticosteroids: [P] Decreased metabolism of corticosteroids leading to increased corticosteroid effect. Dexamethasone may increase estrogen metabolism. Efavirenz: [P] Increased estrogen metabolism, possible reduction in oral contraceptive efficacy. Griseofulvin: [NP] Increased estrogen metabolism, possible reduction in oral contraceptive efficacy. Nelfinavir: [P] Increased estrogen metabolism, possible reduction in oral contraceptive efficacy. Nevirapine: [NP] Increased estrogen metabolism, possible reduction in oral contraceptive efficacy.
Document 3 (Title: Emergency contraception): Types A variety of emergency contraceptive pills are available, including combined estrogen and progestin pills; progestin-only (levonorgestrel, LNG) pills; and antiprogestin (ulipristal acetate or mifepristone) pills. Progestin-only and anti-progestin pills are available as specifically packaged pills for use as emergency contraceptive pills. Emergency contraceptive pills originally contained higher doses of the same hormones (estrogens, progestins, or both) found in regular combined oral contraceptive pills. Combined estrogen and progestin pills are no longer recommended as dedicated emergency contraceptive pills (because this regimen is less effective and caused more nausea), but certain regular combined oral contraceptive pills (taken 2-5 at a time in what was called "the Yuzpe regimen") have also been shown to be effective as emergency contraceptive pills.
Document 4 (Title: Progestins -- Contraindications): Women who have undergone bariatric surgery and those taking certain medications that induce hepatic enzymes, such as antibiotics (rifampin), antifungals (griseofulvin), and anticonvulsants (phenytoin, carbamazepine, topiramate, and barbiturates) are advised not to use combined or progestin-only contraception.

Document 5 (Title: Postpartum Care of the New Mother -- Function -- Components of Postpartum Care): Contraception: The prenatal period is the best time to discuss postpartum contraception. Adolescents begin motivational interviewing and discussion of long-acting reversible contraception during pregnancy. [16] For breastfeeding women, nonhormonal modalities are usually preferred. The ACOG recommends progestin-only contraceptives as the best hormonal contraceptive modality for breastfeeding women. Breastfeeding mothers should not use combination estrogen-progestin contraceptives as it can interfere with breast milk production. [17] Among hormonal methods, combined estrogen-progestin vaginal rings can be used after 4 weeks postpartum. Hormonal methods such as progestin-only oral contraceptives, depot medroxyprogesterone acetate injections, and progestin implants are preferred, as they do not affect milk production. A vaginal diaphragm and cervical cap should be fitted only after complete involution of the uterus, at 6 to 8 weeks after delivery. Intrauterine devices are typically best placed after 4 to 6 weeks after delivery. Breastfeeding is not an effective contraceptive choice. The lactational amenorrhea method alone or other forms of contraception has a failure rate of 2%, but a specific criterion has to be fulfilled. The woman must be breastfeeding exclusively on demand to be amenorrheic) ie, no vaginal bleeding after 8 weeks postpartum), and have an infant younger than 6 months. This becomes less reliable as the infant starts to eat solid foods. Both breastfeeding and non-breast-feeding women can use barrier contraceptives, intrauterine devices (copper-releasing and hormone-releasing), and progestin-only contraception. WHO recommends breastfeeding women wait 6 weeks postpartum before starting progestin-only contraceptives. ACOG recommends combination hormonal contraceptive use should not start until 3 weeks postpartum because of the increased risk of thromboembolism. Women should wait at least 6-18 months before trying to become pregnant again.
