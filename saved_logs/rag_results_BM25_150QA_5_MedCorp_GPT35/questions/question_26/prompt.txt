Document 1 (Title: Ureter): Clinical significance Ureteral stones A kidney stone can move from the kidney and become lodged inside the ureter, which can block the flow of urine, as well as cause a sharp cramp in the back, side, or lower abdomen. Pain often comes in waves lasting up to two hours, then subsides, called renal colic. The affected kidney could then develop hydronephrosis, should a part of the kidney become swollen due to blocked flow of urine. It is classically described that there are three sites in the ureter where a kidney stone will commonly become stuck: where the ureter meets the renal pelvis; where the iliac blood vessels cross the ureters; and where the ureters enter the urinary bladder, however a retrospective case study, which is a primary source, of where stones lodged based on medical imaging did not show many stones at the place where the iliac blood vessels cross.
Document 2 (Title: Case Study: 24-Year-Old Male Presenting With Polyarthralgias (Archived) -- Confirmatory Evaluation): During a follow-up appointment a few weeks later, he complained of multiple subcutaneous nodules. On physical exam, multiple, tender, non-erythematous subcutaneous nodules were noted along with a palpable, non-tender mass on the left side of the abdomen. CT abdomen showed a large heterogeneous mass measuring 20.1 by 10.7 by 18.1 cm, in the left quadrant of the abdomen along with a poorly defined low attenuation mass measuring 2.9 by 3 cm in the right hepatic lobe. CT guided biopsy of the left-sided abdominal mass was non-diagnostic. He underwent exploratory laparotomy, with excision of the left-sided abdominal mass along with splenectomy and distal pancreatectomy. There were multiple abnormal areas in the liver concerning for metastases. Pathology of the resected mass revealed sheets of malignant acinar cells with no intervening ductal structures or islets. Tumor cells were positive for trypsin and cytokeratin and were negative for CD117 and synaptophysin, consistent with pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma. Serum CA 19-9 levels were high. Lipase levels were elevated at 40,000U/dL. At this point, based on the biopsy and staging, the patient was diagnosed with stage IV pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma, but the cause of his polyarthralgia was still uncertain. Adjuvant chemotherapy was initiated with leucovorin, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and oxaliplatin for the carcinoma. During his treatment, his joint swelling and pain progressed and involved new joints of right ankle and left knee. Imaging studies of the joints showed joint effusion and soft tissue swelling. Arthrocentesis of the right ankle joint was performed, and the synovial fluid studies were consistent with infection and cultures were positive for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Pseudomonas. He was treated with antibiotics including vancomycin and piperacillin–tazobactam without any improvement. Due to progressive worsening of the right ankle joint, he required irrigation and debridement with arthrotomy. Repeat cultures were negative, but his symptoms continued to worsen, and he had persistent drainage of milky colored fluid from the surgical site and eventually required a below-knee amputation. Surgical pathology of the right knee joint revealed acute on chronic inflammation with the presence of granulation and fibrin tissue, without any evidence of malignancy. For further evaluation, arthrocentesis of left knee, left ankle, and right wrist was done and yielded milky colored fluid. His lipase levels continued to remain above 20,000 U/dL despite being treated with chemotherapy.
Document 3 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): A 45-year-old man is brought to the local hospital emer-gency department by ambulance. His wife reports that he had been in his normal state of health until 3 days ago when he developed a fever and a productive cough. Dur-ing the last 24 hours he has complained of a headache and is increasingly confused. His wife reports that his medical history is significant only for hypertension, for which he takes hydrochlorothiazide and lisinopril, and that he is allergic to amoxicillin. She says that he developed a rash many years ago when prescribed amoxicillin for bron-chitis. In the emergency department, the man is febrile (38.7°C [101.7°F]), hypotensive (90/54 mmHg), tachypneic (36/min), and tachycardic (110/min). He has no signs of meningismus but is oriented only to person. A stat chest x-ray shows a left lower lung consolidation consistent with pneumonia. A CT scan is not concerning for lesions or elevated intracranial pressure. The plan is to start empiric antibiotics and perform a
Document 4 (Title: [2 cases of intermittent hydronephrosis--usefulness of ultrasonography].): Case 1: An 8-year-old boy consulted our clinic complaining of left flank colicky pain. He had a past history of the same episode. Ultrasonographic study was promptly performed. Left hydronephrosis was detected. At operation, left aberrant renal vessel was resected, and he has been free of pain. Case 2: A 65-year-old woman consulted our clinic because of abdominal pain and fever, who occasionally had the same episode. The existence and disappearance of the right hydronephrosis could be observed by emergency ultrasonography and following ultrasonic study, and the stenosis of the right lower ureter caused of cystitis cystica and glandularis was pointed out by retrograde ureterography. Diuresis ultrasonography by furosemide was performed to evaluate urinary tract stricture. In case 1, an incomplete obstruction pattern was obtained after operation, and in case 2, a complete obstruction pattern was shown. The emergency ultrasonography and diuresis ultrasonography were useful for the diagnosis and observation of intermittent hydronephrosis.
Document 5 (Title: [Embolism caused by a bullet. Report of a case and review of the literature].): We describe the case of a 23 years old male, who suffered a 45 bullet wound in the arm and upper right hemithorax. He walked after his injury and 10 minutes later presented dizziness, cough and tachycardia. On admission a minor haemothorax was seen on a chest X ray, but the bullet was not seen. Even without symptoms, an X ray of abdomen showed the missile lying above the left sacroiliac joint. A chest tube was placed, the patient had an excellent recovery and was discharged a week later. After several months he presented hemoptysis and a moderate pain on his right chest and was treated as an acute bronchitis. Six months after his initial injury he developed a florid picture of acute pulmonary embolism (chest pain, dyspnea, hemoptysis, tachycardia, severe cough). A new chest X ray was done and the bullet was shown lying in the right chest. A pulmonary arteriography located it in a lower basal branch. Through a posterolateral thoracotomy the slug was obtained. The recovery was uneventful and he has remained well since. We discuss the possible mechanisms to explain the entrance of the bullet into the vascular system and conclude that in cases of gunshot wounds: a) An exit wound must be always searched for; if not found exploratory X ray are mandatory, b) If the bullet is not found, specially after thoracic injuries, bullet embolism should be contemplated, c) If there are signs of regional ischemia arteriography is mandatory.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
Question: A 53-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of severe right-sided flank pain for 3 hours. The pain is colicky, radiates towards his right groin, and he describes it as 8/10 in intensity. He has vomited once. He has no history of similar episodes in the past. Last year, he was treated with naproxen for swelling and pain of his right toe. He has a history of hypertension. He drinks one to two beers on the weekends. Current medications include amlodipine. He appears uncomfortable. His temperature is 37.1°C (99.3°F), pulse is 101/min, and blood pressure is 130/90 mm Hg. Examination shows a soft, nontender abdomen and right costovertebral angle tenderness. An upright x-ray of the abdomen shows no abnormalities. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis shows a 7-mm stone in the proximal ureter and grade I hydronephrosis on the right. Which of the following is most likely to be seen on urinalysis?
Options:
A. Urinary pH: 7.3
B. Urinary pH: 4.7
C. Positive nitrites test
D. Largely positive urinary protein
