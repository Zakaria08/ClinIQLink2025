Document 1 (Title: Smooth pursuit): Smooth-pursuit deficits Smooth pursuit requires the coordination of many brain regions that are far away from each other. This makes it particularly susceptible to impairment from a variety of disorders and conditions. Schizophrenia There is significant evidence that smooth pursuit is deficient in people with schizophrenia and their relatives. People with schizophrenia tend to have trouble pursuing very fast targets. This impairment is correlated with less activation in areas known to play a role in pursuit, such as the frontal eye field. However, other studies have shown that people with schizophrenia show relatively normal pursuit, compared to controls, when tracking objects that move unexpectedly. The greatest deficits are when the patients track objects of a predictable velocity which begin moving at a predictable time. This study speculates that smooth pursuit deficits in schizophrenia are a function of the patients' inability to store motion vectors.
Document 2 (Title: Normal eye tracking is associated with abnormal morphology of medial temporal lobe structures in schizophrenia.): Eye tracking and brain morphology assessed by magnetic resonance imaging were examined in 48 patients in their first episode of schizophrenia and in 15 normal controls. Schizophrenic patients showed higher rates of eye tracking dysfunction and more abnormal brain morphology involving the lateral ventricles, medial temporal lobe (MTL) structures and the frontal-parietal cortex than controls. Enlargement of the lateral ventricles and global rating of abnormal brain morphology were significantly more prevalent in male schizophrenics than female schizophrenics. These findings indicate that abnormalities in a variety of brain regions are present in some schizophrenics during the period shortly after the first hospitalization and could not be a function of treatment or chronic illness. We found no relation between abnormal eye tracking and any single feature of abnormal brain morphology. However, normal eye tracking was significantly associated with MTL abnormalities in schizophrenics, reflecting an inverse association between quality of eye tracking and degree of abnormality in MTL structures. These results suggest that abnormal eye tracking is not mediated by the same processes that lead to structural brain anomalies in schizophrenia.
Document 3 (Title: VNG/ENG Testing -- Procedures -- Optokinetic Test): The optokinetic test is a nonvestibular eye movement test similar to the tracking test. However, during optokinetic testing, the patient follows a visual target with their eyes while simultaneously sustaining low-frequency head movements. Many disease processes that cause tracking abnormalities also lead to deficits in optokinetic testing because smooth tracking pathways contribute to generating optokinetic responses. [5] [8] [4]
Document 4 (Title: Psichiatry_DSM-5): White matter connectivity, and gray matter volume in a variety of regions such as the pre- frontal and temporal cortices. Reduced overall brain volume has been observed, as well as increased brain volume reduction with age. Brain volume reductions with age are more pronounced in individuals with schizophrenia than in healthy individuals. Finally, indi- viduals with schizophrenia appear to differ from individuals without the disorder in eye- tracking and electrophysiological indices. Neurological soft signs common in individuals with schizophrenia include impairments in motor coordination, sensory integration, and motor sequencing of complex movements; left-right confusion; and disinhibition of associated movements. In addition, minor phys- ical anomalies of the face and limbs may occur.
Document 5 (Title: Physiology_Levy): The optokinetic reflex (OKR) is a second mechanism by which the CNS stabilizes the visual scene on the retina, and it often works in conjunction with the VOR. Whereas the VOR is activated only by head motion, the OKR is activated by movement of the visual scene, whether caused by motion of the scene itself or by head motion. Specifically, the sensory stimulus for this reflex is slip of the visual scene on the retina as detected by motion-sensitive retinal ganglion cells. An example of the former occurs when you are sitting in a train and a train on the adjacent track begins moving: Your eyes rotate to keep the image of the neighboring car stable. This often leads to a sensation that you are moving (this is not entirely surprising because OKR circuits feed into the same circuits as used by the vestibular system).
