Document 1 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): tested with methylene blue (blue hue look of the kidneys). B. En bloc kidneys transplanted into a 62-year-old woman. Donor aorta anastomosed to recipient’s exter-nal iliac artery; donor cava, to recipient’s external iliac vein.Grafts With Multiple Renal ArteriesIn 10% to 30% of donor kidneys, multiple renal arteries are encountered. Unless kidney transplant candidates have hyper-coagulopathy, grafts with multiple renal arteries fare as well as those with single vessels.86 Vascular reconstruction options include implanting the donor’s arteries separately, reconstruct-ing the multiple arteries into a common channel, or combining multiple arteries into a common Carrel patch (Fig. 11-8).En Bloc GraftsDebate persists about whether to implant kidneys obtained from young donors (<5 years or whose body weight is under 20 kg) as a single en bloc unit into one recipient or separately into two recipients. The underlying issues are the shortage of donor organs, the complexity of the surgical
Document 2 (Title: Transplantation of kidneys from pediatric cadaver donors to adult recipients.): Pediatric donors (less than 12 years old) are a potentially important source of kidneys for adult recipients. Previous reports of decreased graft survival and increased complication rates have made surgeons wary of using such kidneys. In 64 kidneys from younger donors transplanted to adult recipients the delayed graft function rate (41 versus 42%), and 2 and 3-year graft survival rates (67 versus 72% and 61 versus 65%, respectively) were similar to those seen with kidneys from adult donors. Kidneys from donors 24 months old or less experienced an 80% rate of graft loss at 1 year. When these kidneys are excluded the 1-year graft survival rate was similar to kidneys from older and younger donors (70 versus 77%). Mean serum creatinine at 1 year was similar in both groups (155 +/- 21 versus 151 +/- 10). Pediatric kidneys except those obtained from donors 2 years old or less are suitable for adult recipients. However, kidneys from very young donors may be more appropriate to pediatric recipients.
Document 3 (Title: Kidney Transplantation -- Technique or Treatment): Transplant surgery always involves two surgeries, the donor and the recipient. The approach can be performed in a minimally invasive fashion or, less commonly nowadays, via open surgery for the living donor. Implantation in the recipient is performed in an open fashion, where the kidney is placed heterotopically in the pelvis, anastomosing the vessels to the external iliac vessels and the ureter to the bladder. The iliac vessels are preferentially exposed retroperitoneally as the peritoneum is retracted medially. However, intra-peritoneal placement is also acceptable.
Document 4 (Title: Type 1 diabetes): Transplantations of islets alone have become increasingly common. Pancreatic islets are isolated from a donor pancreas, then injected into the recipient's portal vein from which they implant onto the recipient's liver. In nearly half of recipients, the islet transplant continues to work well enough that they still don't need exogenous insulin five years after transplantation. If a transplant fails, recipients can receive subsequent injections of islets from additional donors into the portal vein. Like with whole pancreas transplantation, islet transplantation requires lifelong immunosuppression and depends on the limited supply of donor organs; it is therefore similarly limited to people with severe poorly controlled diabetes and those who have had or are scheduled for a kidney transplant.
Document 5 (Title: Kidney transplantation): Until the routine use of medication to prevent and treat acute rejection, introduced in 1964, deceased donor transplantation was not performed. The kidney was the easiest organ to transplant: tissue typing was simple; the organ was relatively easy to remove and implant; live donors could be used without difficulty; and in the event of failure, kidney dialysis was available from the 1940s. The major barrier to organ transplantation between genetically non-identical patients lay in the recipient's immune system, which would treat a transplanted kidney as a 'non-self' and immediately or chronically reject it. Thus, having medication to suppress the immune system was essential. However, suppressing an individual's immune system places that individual at greater risk of infection and cancer (particularly skin cancer and lymphoma), in addition to the side effects of the medications.
