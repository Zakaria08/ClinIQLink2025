Document 1 (Title: Markers of chronic alcohol ingestion in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis: an aid to diagnosis.): We report here the use of the biochemical marker desialylated transferrin to aid in the diagnosis of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Conventional biochemical tests used for the detection of chronic alcohol consumption fail to differentiate nonalcoholic steatohepatitis patients from alcoholic subjects. In addition, even in those alcoholic subjects with alcoholic liver disease in whom biopsy has been performed, it is impossible to differentiate these two disease states on the basis of morphological examination alone. In this study we have examined two new markers of excessive alcohol intake, desialylated transferrin and mitochondrial AST in subjects with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and in patients consuming excessive amounts of alcohol. All nonalcoholic steatohepatitis patients consumed minimal or no alcohol and were diagnosed by morphological criteria based on liver biopsy specimens. Alcoholic subjects were consuming in excess of 80 gm/day ethanol, often with clinical evidence of overt alcoholism. Control subjects included both healthy controls and patient controls with liver diseases unrelated to alcohol. The ratio of desialylated transferrin/total transferrin was elevated only in patients who consumed excessive amounts of alcohol, whereas the ratio of mitochondrial AST to total AST (mitochondrial AST/total AST) was not significantly different between alcoholic subjects and patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. The sensitivity and specificity for the ratio desialylated transferrin/total transferrin was 81% and 98%, respectively, whereas the sensitivity for the mitochondrial AST/total AST ratio was 92%; the specificity was only 50%, indicating that there were a large number of false-positives. All the conventional markers were less sensitive and less specific than the ratio desialylated transferrin/total transferrin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Document 2 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): nonalcoHolic fatty liver diSeaSe (See alSo cHap. 367e) Fatty liver is a relatively common condition, affecting 25–45% of the U.S. population. However, in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, triglyceride accumulation and inflammation coexist. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis is now present in 3–12% of the population of the United States and other Western countries. Of patients with the metabolic syndrome, ~25–60% have nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and up to 35% have nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. As the prevalence of overweight/obesity and the metabolic syndrome increases, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis may become one of the more common causes of end-stage liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma.
Document 3 (Title: Hepatitis): Alcoholic versus non-alcoholic The most apparent distinguishing factor between alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a history of excessive alcohol use. Thus, in patients who have no or negligible alcohol use, the diagnosis is unlikely to be alcoholic hepatitis. However, in those who use alcohol, the diagnosis may just as likely be alcoholic or nonalcoholic hepatitis especially if there is concurrent obesity, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. In this case, alcoholic and nonalcoholic hepatitis can be distinguished by the pattern of liver enzyme abnormalities; specifically, in alcoholic steatohepatitis AST>ALT with ratio of AST:ALT>2:1 while in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ALT>AST with ratio of ALT:AST>1.5:1.
Document 4 (Title: Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) -- Introduction): Nonalcoholic, fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is defined as the ectopic accumulation of fat in the liver (hepatic steatosis) when no other causes of secondary liver fat accumulation are present. Although, minor deposition of fat can occur in the liver of healthy adults, deposition of fat in at least 5% of hepatocytes is considered pathologic. NAFLD includes both nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) which is diagnosed when there is evidence of inflammatory activity and hepatocyte injury in a steatotic liver tissue. The diagnosis of NAFLD should not be made in a patient who has a history of significant alcohol consumption. The acceptable level of daily alcohol consumption is considered to be less than 20 g/day in men and 10 g/day in women. These cutoff values are not accurately defined, especially in patients with prior history of heavy alcohol use and those who are prone to NASH. NASH can progress to liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma with about 30% to 40% of patients developing fibrosis. NASH is not a diagnosis of exclusion and can be associated with other liver conditions such as chronic hepatitis C. NASH is classified into two types, primary; which is related to obesity and diabetes in the absence of excessive alcohol intake, and secondary; which is toxin or drug induced. This article will focus on primary NASH. [1] [2] [3] [4]
Document 5 (Title: Alcoholic-Associated Hepatitis -- Differential Diagnosis): The differential diagnoses of alcoholic hepatitis include nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, acute or chronic viral hepatitis, drug-induced liver injury, fulminant Wilson disease, autoimmune liver disease, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, pyogenic hepatic abscess, ascending cholangitis, or decompensation associated with hepatocellular carcinoma.
