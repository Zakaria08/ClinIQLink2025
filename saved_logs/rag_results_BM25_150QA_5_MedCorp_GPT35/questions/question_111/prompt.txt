Document 1 (Title: Calcium signaling): Phospholipase C Pathway Specific signals can trigger a sudden increase in the cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels to 500–1,000 nM by opening channels in the ER or the plasma membrane. The most common signaling pathway that increases cytoplasmic calcium concentration is the phospholipase C (PLC) pathway. Many cell surface receptors, including G protein-coupled receptors and receptor tyrosine kinases, activate the PLC enzyme. PLC uses hydrolysis of the membrane phospholipid PIP2 to form IP3 and diacylglycerol (DAG), two classic secondary messengers. DAG attaches to the plasma membrane and recruits protein kinase C (PKC). IP3 diffuses to the ER and is bound to the IP3 receptor. The IP3 receptor serves as a Ca2+ channel, and releases Ca2+ from the ER. The Ca2+ bind to PKC and other proteins and activate them.
Document 2 (Title: Formation of second messengers in response to activation of ion channels in excitable cells.): 1. Depolarization of excitable cells of the central nervous system results in the formation of the second messengers cyclic AMP, cyclic GMP, inositol phosphates, and diacylglycerides. 2. Depolarization-evoked accumulation of cyclic AMP in brain preparations can be accounted for mainly by the release of adenosine, which subsequently interacts with stimulatory adenosine receptor linked to adenylate cyclase. 3. Depolarization-evoked formation of cyclic GMP in brain preparations is linked to activation of voltage-dependent calcium channels, presumably leading to activation of guanylate cyclase by calcium ions. 4. In brain slices depolarization-evoked stimulation of phosphoinositide breakdown and subsequent formation of inositol phosphates and diacylglycerides are linked to activation of voltage-dependent calcium channels, which are sensitive to dihydropyridines, presumably leading to activation of phospholipase(s) C by calcium ions. 5. In the synaptoneurosome preparation depolarization-evoked stimulation of phosphoinositide breakdown does not involve activation of dihydropyridine-sensitive calcium channels and, instead, appears to be regulated primarily by the intracellular concentration of sodium ions. Thus, agents that induce increases in intracellular sodium--such as toxins that open or delay inactivation of voltage-dependent sodium channels; ouabain, an inhibitor of Na+/K+ ATPase that transports sodium outward and a sodium ionophore--all stimulate phosphoinositide breakdown. Mechanistically, increases in intracellular sodium either might directly affect phospholipase(s) C or might lead to influx of calcium ions through Na+/Ca2+ transporters. 6. Depolarization-evoked stimulation of cyclic AMP formation and phosphoinositide breakdown can exhibit potentiative interactions with responses to receptor agonists, thereby providing mechanisms for modulation of receptor responses by neuronal activity. 7. Since all these second messengers can induce phosphorylation of ion channels through the activation of specific kinases, it is proposed that depolarization-evoked formation of second messengers represents a putative feedback mechanism to regulate ion fluxes in excitable cells.

G protein subunits or • Fig. 6.12 Neurotransmitter receptors. The basic structure and mechanism of action are shown for ligand-gated ion channels (ionotropic receptors) (A) and G protein–coupled (metabotropic) receptors (B). Detailed structures of cys-loop and glutamate ionotropic receptors are shown in C and D, respectively. Cys-loop receptors include ionotropic receptors for GABA, glycine, serotonin, and acetylcholine. Note the differing membrane topologies of the individual subunits of these two classes of receptors: four transmembrane domains for cys-loop receptors and three plus a pore loop for glutamate receptors. Pore loops form the internal wall of the glutamate channel, whereas transmembrane domain 2 forms the internal wall of cys-loop receptors. (A and B, From Purves D, Augustine GJ, Fitzpatrick D.

Document 4 (Title: Physiology, Gastric Inhibitory Peptide -- Mechanism): GIP acts on class-II G-protein coupled receptors. [15] The signaling mechanism for these receptors primarily involves the activation of adenylate cyclase/protein kinase A and phospholipase C/protein C cascades. High levels of GIP receptors are expressed in the beta cells of the pancreatic islets. The binding of GIP to its receptor increases the intracellular cAMP levels with a downstream increase in calcium ion concentration and exocytosis of insulin. [16] GIP is rapidly inactivated by the ubiquitous enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4), which is the same enzyme that cleaves GLP-1. [16] However, the inactivation of GIP occurs at a slower rate than GLP-1, giving GIP a half-life of 5 to 7 minutes. [3] DPP-4 cleaves alanine and proline residues in position 2 of the N-terminus in peptide chains. [17] Thus, substituting L-alanine for D-alanine residue at position 2 of GIP makes it resistant to the action of DPP-4 and enhances its incretin effect. [18]
Document 5 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): FIGURE 2–5 Known transmembrane signaling mechanisms: 1: A lipid-soluble chemical signal crosses the plasma membrane and acts on an intracellular receptor (which may be an enzyme or a regulator of gene transcription); 2: the signal binds to the extracellular domain of a transmembrane protein, thereby activating an enzymatic activity of its cytoplasmic domain; 3: the signal binds to the extracellular domain of a transmembrane receptor bound to a separate protein tyrosine kinase, which it activates; 4: the signal binds to and directly regulates the opening of an ion channel; 5: the signal binds to a cell-surface receptor linked to an effector enzyme by a G protein. (A, C, substrates; B, D, products; R, receptor; G, G protein; E, effector [enzyme or ion channel]; Y, tyrosine; P, phosphate.) Although the five established mechanisms do not account for all the chemical signals conveyed across cell membranes, they do transduce many of the most important signals exploited in pharmacotherapy.
