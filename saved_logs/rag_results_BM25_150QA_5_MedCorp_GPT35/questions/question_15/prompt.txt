Document 1 (Title: Acute bronchitis): A variety of tests may be performed in people presenting with cough and shortness of breath: A chest X-ray is useful to exclude pneumonia which is more common in those with a fever, fast heart rate, fast respiratory rate, or who are old. A sputum sample showing neutrophil granulocytes (inflammatory white blood cells) and culture showing that has pathogenic microorganisms such as Streptococcus species. A blood test would indicate inflammation (as indicated by a raised white blood cell count and elevated C-reactive protein). Decreased breath sounds, crackles, wheezing, and rhonchi that clears with coughs may be heard in the chest. Dullness to percussion and pleural rub suggest disease extension beyond the bronchi such as seen with pneumonia. Paroxysms of cough followed by inspiratory whoop and vomiting suggests pertussis.
Document 2 (Title: Case Study: 33-Year-Old Female Presents with Chronic SOB and Cough (Archived) -- Case Presentation -- Physical Exam:): Vitals: Temperature, 97.8 F; heart rate 88; respiratory rate, 22; blood pressure 130/86; body mass index, 28 General: She is well appearing but anxious, a pleasant female lying on a hospital stretcher. She is conversing freely, with respiratory distress causing her to stop mid-sentence. Respiratory: She has diffuse rales and mild wheezing; tachypneic. Cardiovascular: She has a regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Gastrointestinal: Bowel sounds X4. No bruits or pulsatile mass.
Document 3 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): A 21-year-old woman comes with her parents to discuss therapeutic options for her Crohn’s disease. She was diag-nosed with Crohn’s disease 2 years ago, and it involves her terminal ileum and proximal colon, as confirmed by colonoscopy and small bowel radiography. She was initially treated with mesalamine and budesonide with good response, but over the last 2 months, she has had a relapse of her symptoms. She is experiencing fatigue, cramping, abdominal pains, and nonbloody diarrhea up to 10 times daily, and she has had a 15-lb weight loss. She has no other significant medical or surgical his-tory. Her current medications are mesalamine 2.4 g/d and budesonide 9 mg/d. She appears thin and tired. Abdominal examination reveals tenderness without guarding in the right lower quadrant; no masses are palpable. On perianal examination, there is no tenderness, fissure, or fistula. Her laboratory data are notable for anemia and elevated C-reactive protein. What are the options for immediate
Document 4 (Title: [A case of adult Still's disease with pulmonary hypertension].): The patient was a 29-year-old woman. She was well until autumn 1983, when she presented with polyarthralgia, fever above 39 degrees C, hepatosplenomegaly, swelling of lymphnode and salmon pink rash. Laboratory tests revealed marked leucocytosis with shift to the left, elevated ESR, strong positivity of CRP and abnormal liver function tests. However, anti-nuclear antibody and RA factor were negative. She was diagnosed as adult onset Still's disease (AOSD) by characteristic clinical course and laboratory data. During her disease course these abnormal findings could be well controlled neither by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, immunosuppressive agents nor corticosteroids. Two and half years after the first admission, she began to complain of dry cough, dyspnea on efforts. Auscultation revealed an increased pulmonic sound and systolic murmur of cardiac apex. Chest X-Rays showed enlarged main pulmonary arteries. The lung fields were normal. Pulmonary function tests gave no evidence of a significant obstructive or restrictive defect but showed the low DLco and hypoxemia. Ventilation-perfusion lung scanning failed to reveal pulmonary embolism. Finally, right heart catheterization confirmed the pulmonary precapillary hypertension. Her pulmonary hypertension has progressed rapidly, strongly suggesting poor prognosis. Her pulmonary hypertension associated with no apparent parenchymal involvement was thought to be caused by a pulmonary vascular change probably related to AOSD. This case is a first case of AOSD with pulmonary hypertension.
Document 5 (Title: [A case of miliary tuberculosis associated with acute respiratory failure during pregnancy].): A case of miliary tuberculosis associated with acute respiratory failure during pregnancy was reported. A 39-year-old, 29-week pregnant woman was admitted to our hospital with complaints of nonproductive cough and fever on June 12. On admission, her temperature was 38.2 degrees C; pulse rate was 90/min., and blood pressure was 120/76 mmHg. Physical examination revealed moist rales at right lung basis. Chest X-ray showed small nodular infiltrates in right lower lung field. Laboratory data revealed positive CRP, accelerated ESR and increased level of alpha 2-globulin. The number of T-cells was markedly decreased (14/mm3). The PPD skin test was negative, and the sputum smears for acid-fast bacilli were negative. Suspected of bacterial or viral pneumonia, the patient was treated with antibiotics (CPM, EM and CAZ), which had no effects for her. On June 16, the Chest X-ray showed infiltrates throughout bilateral lung fields, and the patient became increasingly dyspneic. On June 18, the results of arterial blood gas, analysis under room air were: PaO2 26.7 Torr, PaCO2 29.0 Torr, pH 7.505. Because of severe hypoxemia, she was intubated and placed on a volume-cycled respirator. Hydrocortisone (1000 mg, daily) was added to treatment because ARDS was suspected. Since the smears of tracheobronchial secretions showed acid-fast bacilli on June 24, she was diagnosed to have miliary tuberculosis. Then the intensive therapy with antituberculosis drugs (isoniazid 400 mg, rifampicin 450 mg, and streptomycin 1g, daily) was started. The non specific antibiotics were discontinued; hydrocortisone was tapered and stopped. The next week, she became afebrile and hypoxemia steadily improved.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
Question: A 62-year-old woman comes to the physician because of coughing and fatigue during the past 2 years. In the morning, the cough is productive of white phlegm. She becomes short of breath walking up a flight of stairs. She has hypertension and hyperlipidemia. She has recently retired from working as a nurse at a homeless shelter. She has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for 40 years. Current medications include ramipril and fenofibrate. Her temperature is 36.5°C (97.7°F), respirations are 24/min, pulse is 85/min, and blood pressure is 140/90 mm Hg. Scattered wheezing and rhonchi are heard throughout both lung fields. There are no murmurs, rubs, or gallops but heart sounds are distant. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms?
Options:
A. Chronic decrease in pulmonary compliance
B. Local accumulation of kinins
C. Progressive obstruction of expiratory airflow
D. Incremental loss of functional residual capacity
