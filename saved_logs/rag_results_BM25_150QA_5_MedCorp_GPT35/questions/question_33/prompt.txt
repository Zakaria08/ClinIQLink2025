Document 1 (Title: [Elderly non-Hodgkin's lymphoma presenting with pulmonary squamous cell carcinoma as a complication of chemotherapy for malignant lymphoma].): The authors report a case of pulmonary squamous cell carcinoma which occurred after chemotherapy of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). A 76-year-old man, who was admitted to our department because of swelling of cervical lymph nodes, was diagnosed as having NHL (follicular mixed cell lymphoma). He was treated with 11 courses of CHOP therapy. Thereafter, chemotherapy including ifosfamide was carried out for approximately three years. In June, 1991, he was readmitted to our department because of swelling and pain in his left thigh and an abnormal shadow on chest X-ray. Chest CT demonstrated a cavitated shadow (about 5 cm in diameter) with an irregular margin in right S1, which was suggested to be lung cancer or pulmonary infiltration of malignant lymphoma. Bronchoscopy, which was carried out on July 12, showed bloody sputa from the right B1 ramus and markedly reddened mucosa at the orifice of the right upper bronchus. Sputum cytology revealed no malignancy. ACVP-16 chemotherapy including ara-C, CBDCA and VP-16 was initiated on July 14 because of enlarged superficial lymph nodes. On July 18, he fell out of bed and fractured his left femur. He also suffered from respiratory failure. He died of pulmonary haemorrhage on July 26. Autopsy revealed pulmonary squamous cell carcinoma. The occurrence of pulmonary squamous cell carcinoma is rare after the chemotherapy of malignant lymphoma.
Document 2 (Title: 38-Year-Old Male Presents With Lower Extremity Edema -- Case Presentation): His physical exam revealed clear lungs and a normal heart exam on auscultation. His abdomen was soft and non-tender, and his skin was warm and dry with no rash. He had 2 plus pitting edema at the ankles. Initial laboratory data was consistent with acute kidney injury (AKI) with worsening creatinine from 1.2 to 1.6 over 1 month and nephrotic range proteinuria. Serologies for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, anti-nuclear antibody (ANA), c-ANCA, serine protease 3 (PR3) IgG, myeloperoxidase antibody (MPO), and complement levels were sent. He was started on losartan for proteinuria with plans for renal biopsy; however, he was lost to follow up. The patient then presented two weeks later with worsening edema to his waist, continued weight gain, mild hemoptysis, and streaks of blood in the stool. Physical examination now showed worsening pitting edema up to his waist with new non-pruritic, erythematous excoriations on the medial aspect of his thighs bilaterally. He was admitted to the hospital with concern for worsening vasculitis. He was started on oral prednisone and underwent a renal biopsy. For his edema, he was started on diuretics to which he responded well. Due to persistent leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing was performed to complete the workup.
Document 3 (Title: Non-Hodgkin lymphoma): Treatment The traditional treatment of NHL includes chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and stem-cell transplants. There have also been developments in immunotherapy used in the treatment of NHL. Chemotherapy The most common chemotherapy used for B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma is R-CHOP, which is a regimen of four drugs (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) plus rituximab.
Document 4 (Title: Biochemistry_Lippinco): 1.2. A 50-year-old man presented with painful blisters on the backs of his hands. He was a golf instructor and indicated that the blisters had erupted shortly after the golfing season began. He did not have recent exposure to common skin irritants. He had partial complex seizure disorder that had begun ~3 years earlier after a head injury. The patient had been taking phenytoin (his only medication) since the onset of the seizure disorder. He admitted to an average weekly ethanol intake of ~18 12-oz cans of beer. The patient’s urine was reddish orange. Cultures obtained from skin lesions failed to grow organisms. A 24-hour urine collection showed elevated uroporphyrin (1,000 mg; normal, <27 mg). The most likely diagnosis is: A. acute intermittent porphyria. B. congenital erythropoietic porphyria. C. erythropoietic protoporphyria. D. hereditary coproporphyria. E. porphyria cutanea tarda.
Document 5 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): A 45-year-old man is brought to the local hospital emer-gency department by ambulance. His wife reports that he had been in his normal state of health until 3 days ago when he developed a fever and a productive cough. Dur-ing the last 24 hours he has complained of a headache and is increasingly confused. His wife reports that his medical history is significant only for hypertension, for which he takes hydrochlorothiazide and lisinopril, and that he is allergic to amoxicillin. She says that he developed a rash many years ago when prescribed amoxicillin for bron-chitis. In the emergency department, the man is febrile (38.7°C [101.7°F]), hypotensive (90/54 mmHg), tachypneic (36/min), and tachycardic (110/min). He has no signs of meningismus but is oriented only to person. A stat chest x-ray shows a left lower lung consolidation consistent with pneumonia. A CT scan is not concerning for lesions or elevated intracranial pressure. The plan is to start empiric antibiotics and perform a
