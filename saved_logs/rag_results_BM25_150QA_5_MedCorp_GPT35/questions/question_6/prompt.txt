Document 1 (Title: Jeanne Calment): Medical follow-up Medical student Georges Garoyan published a thesis on Calment when she was 114 years old in January 1990. The first part records her daily routine, and the second presents her medical history. She stated that she had been vaccinated as a child but could not remember which vaccine(s). Apart from aspirin against migraines she had never taken any medicine, not even herbal teas. She did not contract German measles, chickenpox, or urinary infections, and was not prone to hypertension or diabetes. In April 1986, aged 111, she was sent to a hospital for heart failure and treated with digoxin. Later she suffered from arthropathy in the ankles, elbows, and wrists, which was successfully treated with anti-inflammatory medication. Her arterial blood pressure was 140mm/70mm, her pulse 84/min. Her height was , and her weight , showing little variation from previous years. She scored well on mental tests, except on numeric tasks and recall of recent events.
Document 2 (Title: Case Study: 33-Year-Old Female Presents with Chronic SOB and Cough (Archived) -- Case Presentation): History of Present Illness: A 33-year-old white female presents after admission to the general medical/surgical hospital ward with a chief complaint of shortness of breath on exertion. She reports that she was seen for similar symptoms previously at her primary care physician’s office six months ago. At that time, she was diagnosed with acute bronchitis and treated with bronchodilators, empiric antibiotics, and a short course oral steroid taper. This management did not improve her symptoms, and she has gradually worsened over six months. She reports a 20-pound (9 kg) intentional weight loss over the past year. She denies camping, spelunking, or hunting activities. She denies any sick contacts. A brief review of systems is negative for fever, night sweats, palpitations, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, neural sensation changes, muscular changes, and increased bruising or bleeding. She admits a cough, shortness of breath, and shortness of breath on exertion.
Document 3 (Title: Prophylactic subcutaneous heparin therapy as a cause of bilateral adrenal hemorrhage.): A 63-year-old white woman was admitted to the hospital for bilateral total knee arthroplasty. She was given prophylactic subcutaneous heparin therapy postoperatively. Three days later, she had a brief hypotensive episode and an unexplained drop in hemoglobin level. Seven days postoperatively, she became confused and disoriented while complaining of pain in her right side and, later, under her left breast. She also had nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and a vague feeling of "illness." Her condition deteriorated progressively, with blood pressure falling to 65/40 mm Hg and a temperature of 39.7 degrees C. Blood, urine, and cerebrospinal-fluid culture samples showed no evidence of infection. A diagnosis of acute adrenal insufficiency was made. Following corticosteroid therapy, the patient's condition improved markedly. Of interest in our patient was that she had had no antecedent hypotension, sepsis, fever, or surgical complications. Acute adrenal hemorrhage is often overlooked because the symptoms are attributed to other conditions, especially to sepsis. Acute adrenal hemorrhage should be suspected in any stressed patient in whom an abrupt deterioration associated with back or abdominal pain, hypotension, and unexplained fever are noted. Suspicion should be raised regarding those patients who are receiving anticoagulant therapy (including subcutaneous heparin prophylaxis) at the time of deterioration. With increased awareness, more cases of acute bilateral adrenal hemorrhage and subsequent adrenal insufficiency can be recognized ante mortem and treated.
Document 4 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): Her social history is significant for alcohol use (three to four glasses of wine/night). Her vital signs include the following: temperature 99.8°F, blood pressure 132/64 mm Hg, pulse 78 bpm, and respiratory rate 15/min. On physical examination, she had left upper abdominal tenderness with evidence of hepatomegaly and mild scleral icterus. Laboratory data revealed the following: alanine aminotransferase, 527 IU/L (normal 10–35 IU/L); aspartate aminotransferase, 425 IU/L (normal < 35 IU/L); and bilirubin, 2.9 mg/dL (normal 0.1–0.3 mg/dL). What medications do OTC cold and flu preparations typically contain? Which of the OTC medications might have contrib-uted to the patient’s current symptoms? KH, a 55-year-old woman, presents to the emergency department with nausea, vomiting, and complaints of new-onset flu symptoms over the past several days. Her past medical history is significant for allergic rhinitis and chronic lower back pain secondary to a work-related fall 2 years ago. Her

Ultrasound reveals a deep vein thrombosis in the left lower extremity; chest computed tomography scan confirms the presence of pulmonary emboli. Laboratory blood tests indicate elevated d-dimer levels. What therapy is indicated acutely? What are the long-term therapy options? How long should she be treated? Should this indi-vidual use oral contraceptives? A 25-year-old woman presents to the emergency depart-ment complaining of acute onset of shortness of breath and pleuritic pain. She had been in her usual state of health until 2 days prior when she noted that her left leg was swollen and red. Her only medication was oral contraceptives. Family history was significant for a history of “blood clots” in mul-tiple members of the maternal side of her family. Physical examination demonstrates an anxious woman with stable vital signs.

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
Question: A 40-year-old zookeeper presents to the emergency department complaining of severe abdominal pain that radiates to her back, and nausea. The pain started 2 days ago and slowly increased until she could not tolerate it any longer. Past medical history is significant for hypertension and hypothyroidism. Additionally, she reports that she was recently stung by one of the zoo’s smaller scorpions, but did not seek medical treatment. She takes aspirin, levothyroxine, oral contraceptive pills, and a multivitamin daily. Family history is noncontributory. Today, her blood pressure is 108/58 mm Hg, heart rate is 99/min, respiratory rate is 21/min, and temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F). On physical exam, she is a well-developed, obese female that looks unwell. Her heart has a regular rate and rhythm. Radial pulses are weak but symmetric. Her lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Her lateral left ankle is swollen, erythematous, and painful to palpate. An abdominal CT is consistent with acute pancreatitis. Which of the following is the most likely etiology for this patient’s disease?
Options:
A. Aspirin
B. Oral contraceptive pills
C. Scorpion sting
D. Hypothyroidism
