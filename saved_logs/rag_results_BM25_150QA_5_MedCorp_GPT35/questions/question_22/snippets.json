        "title": "Influence of photoinhibition, photostimulation and prolactin on pituitary and hypothalamic nuclear androgen receptors in the male hamster.",
        "content": "Testosterone (T) feedback sensitivity is markedly altered in adult male golden hamsters following exposure to short photoperiods (SD). Using a technique which measures total androgen receptors within the cell nucleus, the present study examined pituitary and hypothalamic nuclear androgen receptor levels in animals exposed to (1) long days (LD) or SD in the presence and absence of a constant T level supplied via a Silastic implant, (2) photostimulation following SD-induced testicular regression and (3) short-term prolactin injections following SD-induced testicular regression. Short photoperiods were associated with a drop in nuclear androgen receptor levels which was correlated with a decline in circulating T. When constant T was supplied to gonadectomized hamsters, those exposed to SD possessed higher pituitary and similar hypothalamic nuclear androgen receptor levels than those exposed to LD. As expected, plasma luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels were greatly reduced in SD-exposed, castrated, T-treated hamsters as compared to LD-exposed, castrated, T-treated animals. Photostimulation of intact SD-exposed hamsters for 5 or 10 days was associated with a decline in pituitary nuclear androgen receptors. Prolactin treatment caused no noticeable change in pituitary or hypothalamic androgen receptors even though plasma LH and FSH levels were significantly increased. These results support the hypothesis that altered T feedback mechanisms controlling LH and FSH release following chronic exposure to SD may be related to an alteration in the amount of androgen receptors present in the anterior pituitary.",

        "title": "Neuroanatomy, Nucleus Supraoptic -- Surgical Considerations",
        "content": "Previous studies have suggested that axonal injury to the hypothalamo-neurohypophyseal tract can cause the MCNs in the hypothalamus to degenerate and the development of central diabetes insipidus (DI). Injury to the vasopressin and oxytocin neurons results in morphological changes to the neurohypophysis. [15] These injuries can include compression of the pituitary stalk, [16] [17] hypophysectomy, [18] neurohypophysectomy, [19] [20] [21] and transection of the pituitary stalk. [22] [23] [24] Absolute resection of the pituitary gland can result in an inability to store and secrete vasopressin in the posterior pituitary. Research has shown plasma vasopressin concentration to reduce after axotomy. Dohanics et al. demonstrated, through a stereotaxic method, compression of the pituitary stalk led to significant DI along with significant degeneration of the vasopressin neuron population in the supraoptic nucleus and paraventricular nucleus. Their study indicated, 21 days after surgery, only 35% and 27% of vasopressin neurons in the supraoptic nucleus and paraventricular nucleus survived, respectively. [16] In another study, Alonso et al. demonstrated, after transecting the neurohypophyseal axons through the median eminence, the number of oxytocin-producing neurons of the supraoptic nucleus slightly decreased by 20% compared to controls whereas the number of vasopressin-producing neurons reduced significantly by 60%. Many of the axons that regenerate in the median eminence are oxytocin\u00a0neurohypophyseal neurons. [24] However, when the experimental animals had a median eminence transection and a unilateral cut in the lateral hypothalamus just above the supraoptic nucleus, survival of oxytocin-producing and vasopressin-producing neurons dropped significantly in the ipsilateral supraoptic nucleus\u00a0versus the contralateral supraoptic nucleus. These results suggest that oxytocin-producing neurons (and on a smaller scale, vasopressin-producing neurons) of the supraoptic nucleus possess collateral projections in the lateral hypothalamus that shield them from retrograde degeneration during injury.

Controlling networks of genetically modified cells with light, an emerging field known as Optogenetics., allows researchers now to explore the causal link between activity in a specific group of neurons and mental events, e.g. decision making.
