Document 1 (Title: Influence of photoinhibition, photostimulation and prolactin on pituitary and hypothalamic nuclear androgen receptors in the male hamster.): Testosterone (T) feedback sensitivity is markedly altered in adult male golden hamsters following exposure to short photoperiods (SD). Using a technique which measures total androgen receptors within the cell nucleus, the present study examined pituitary and hypothalamic nuclear androgen receptor levels in animals exposed to (1) long days (LD) or SD in the presence and absence of a constant T level supplied via a Silastic implant, (2) photostimulation following SD-induced testicular regression and (3) short-term prolactin injections following SD-induced testicular regression. Short photoperiods were associated with a drop in nuclear androgen receptor levels which was correlated with a decline in circulating T. When constant T was supplied to gonadectomized hamsters, those exposed to SD possessed higher pituitary and similar hypothalamic nuclear androgen receptor levels than those exposed to LD. As expected, plasma luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels were greatly reduced in SD-exposed, castrated, T-treated hamsters as compared to LD-exposed, castrated, T-treated animals. Photostimulation of intact SD-exposed hamsters for 5 or 10 days was associated with a decline in pituitary nuclear androgen receptors. Prolactin treatment caused no noticeable change in pituitary or hypothalamic androgen receptors even though plasma LH and FSH levels were significantly increased. These results support the hypothesis that altered T feedback mechanisms controlling LH and FSH release following chronic exposure to SD may be related to an alteration in the amount of androgen receptors present in the anterior pituitary.
Document 2 (Title: Cell_Biology_Alberts): A gene encoding channelrhodopsin was introduced into a subpopulation of neurons in the hypothalamus of a mouse. When the neurons were exposed to flashing blue light using a tiny, implanted fiber optic cable, the channelrhodopsin channels opened, depolarizing and activating the cells. When the light was switched on, the mouse immediately became aggressive and attacked the inflated rubber glove; when the light was switched off, its behavior immediately returned to normal (Movie 11.11).

It is therefore now possible to transiently activate or inhibit specific neurons in the brains of awake animals with remarkable spatial and temporal precision. In this way, the rapidly expanding new field of optogenetics is revolutionizing neurobiology, allowing neuroscientists to analyze the neurons and circuits underlying even the most complex behaviors in experimental animals,
Document 3 (Title: Neuroanatomy, Nucleus Supraoptic -- Surgical Considerations): Previous studies have suggested that axonal injury to the hypothalamo-neurohypophyseal tract can cause the MCNs in the hypothalamus to degenerate and the development of central diabetes insipidus (DI). Injury to the vasopressin and oxytocin neurons results in morphological changes to the neurohypophysis. [15] These injuries can include compression of the pituitary stalk, [16] [17] hypophysectomy, [18] neurohypophysectomy, [19] [20] [21] and transection of the pituitary stalk. [22] [23] [24] Absolute resection of the pituitary gland can result in an inability to store and secrete vasopressin in the posterior pituitary. Research has shown plasma vasopressin concentration to reduce after axotomy. Dohanics et al. demonstrated, through a stereotaxic method, compression of the pituitary stalk led to significant DI along with significant degeneration of the vasopressin neuron population in the supraoptic nucleus and paraventricular nucleus. Their study indicated, 21 days after surgery, only 35% and 27% of vasopressin neurons in the supraoptic nucleus and paraventricular nucleus survived, respectively. [16] In another study, Alonso et al. demonstrated, after transecting the neurohypophyseal axons through the median eminence, the number of oxytocin-producing neurons of the supraoptic nucleus slightly decreased by 20% compared to controls whereas the number of vasopressin-producing neurons reduced significantly by 60%. Many of the axons that regenerate in the median eminence are oxytocin neurohypophyseal neurons. [24] However, when the experimental animals had a median eminence transection and a unilateral cut in the lateral hypothalamus just above the supraoptic nucleus, survival of oxytocin-producing and vasopressin-producing neurons dropped significantly in the ipsilateral supraoptic nucleus versus the contralateral supraoptic nucleus. These results suggest that oxytocin-producing neurons (and on a smaller scale, vasopressin-producing neurons) of the supraoptic nucleus possess collateral projections in the lateral hypothalamus that shield them from retrograde degeneration during injury. [24]
Document 4 (Title: Channelrhodopsin): Channelrhodopsins can be readily expressed in excitable cells such as neurons using a variety of transfection techniques (viral transfection, electroporation, gene gun) or transgenic animals. The light-absorbing pigment retinal is present in most cells (of vertebrates) as Vitamin A, making it possible to photostimulate neurons without adding any chemical compounds. Before the discovery of channelrhodopsins, neuroscientists were limited to recording the activity of neurons in the brain and correlate this activity with behavior. This is not sufficient to prove that the recorded neural activity actually caused that behavior. Controlling networks of genetically modified cells with light, an emerging field known as Optogenetics., allows researchers now to explore the causal link between activity in a specific group of neurons and mental events, e.g. decision making. Optical control of behavior has been demonstrated in nematodes, fruit flies, zebrafish, and mice. Recently,
Document 5 (Title: Expression vector): Transgenic animals have also been produced to study animal biochemical processes and human diseases, or used to produce pharmaceuticals and other proteins. They may also be engineered to have advantageous or useful traits. Green fluorescent protein is sometimes used as tags which results in animal that can fluoresce, and this have been exploited commercially to produce the fluorescent GloFish. Gene therapy Gene therapy is a promising treatment for a number of diseases where a "normal" gene carried by the vector is inserted into the genome, to replace an "abnormal" gene or supplement the expression of particular gene. Viral vectors are generally used but other nonviral methods of delivery are being developed. The treatment is still a risky option due to the viral vector used which can cause ill-effects, for example giving rise to insertional mutation that can result in cancer. However, there have been promising results. See also Cloning vector Host cell protein References

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
Question: An investigator is studying the function of the lateral nucleus of the hypothalamus in an experimental animal. Using a viral vector, the genes encoding chloride-conducting channelrhodopsins are injected into this nucleus.
