Document 1 (Title: University of Worcester): In August 2010 the university was granted research degree-awarding powers, enabling it to confer the awards of MPhil and PhD. Before this Coventry University assisted in the academic awarding of these degrees. The university includes eight national research centres: The National Pollen and Aerobiology Research Unit from where all UK national pollen forecasts originate, and testing of new hay fever and anti-allergen devices is conducted. The Centre for Rural Research, which examined the psychological effects of the mass flooding in the UK in recent years. The International Centre for Children's Literature, Literacy and Creativity is, with University of Cambridge and Roehampton University, one of the three UK university centres to employ full-time children's literature professors.
Document 2 (Title: An aerobiological survey of allergens in al Khobar, Saudi Arabia.): A nationwide aerobiologic study is in progress in Saudi Arabia using Burkard 7-day volumetric spore traps to determine the major airborne allergens and their seasonal patterns. Eights months readings have been completed at Al-Khobar, an important coastal city on the Arabian Gulf. Pollen levels showed a double season. An autumnal peak reached its maximum in October rising sharply from the low summer values before falling during the short winter then rising again in springtime. Both local and imported flora were represented with chenopodiaceae, grasses and Ambrosia as the most common botanical groups, identification of the most significant individual species is still in progress. Fungal spores also show distinctive seasonal patterns. In descending rank order from the most common genera were Cladosporium, Ustilago, Alternaria, with Chaetomium and Ulocladium as consistent but minor components. Basiodiospores and Ascospores represented less than 10% of the total spore population, indicative of the dry nature of the climate. Desert dust added an important irritant to the Saudi atmosphere but a major contaminating factor to the aerobiological material being analysed.
Document 3 (Title: Dust Mite Allergy -- Differential Diagnosis): Other than dust mites, house dust allergy can be caused by the following allergen sources: Mold. The fungus grows in a humid environment like house basements, kitchens, gardens, and bathrooms. The spores of the mold become airborne, which on inhalation leads to allergic rhinitis. Cockroaches. These are found in a variety of environments. The saliva, fecal matter, and shed off parts of cockroaches serve as potential allergens for triggering allergies. Around 68 percent of households in the USA are known to have cockroach allergens. The percentage increases further in urban areas. Pollen. Flowers, grass, weeds, and trees are sources of pollens that constitute an essential component of household dust. These are a common cause for triggering allergic reactions. Pets. Fur, feathers, animal hair, dander, saliva, and fecal matter all serve as allergens. [31] Dust mite allergy can be confused with non-allergic forms of rhinitis. [32] These include the following:
Document 4 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): ALLERGENS Inhaled allergens activate mast cells with bound IgE directly leading to the immediate release of bronchoconstrictor mediators, resulting in the early response that is reversed by bronchodilators. Often, experimental allergen challenge is followed by a late response when there is airway edema and an acute inflammatory response with increased eosinophils and neutrophils that are not very reversible with bronchodilators. The most common allergens to trigger asthma are Dermatophagoides species, and environmental exposure leads to low-grade chronic symptoms that are perennial. Other perennial allergens are derived from cats and other domestic pets, as well as cockroaches. Other allergens, including grass pollen, ragweed, tree pollen, and fungal spores, are seasonal. Pollens usually cause allergic rhinitis rather than asthma, but in thunderstorms, the pollen grains are disrupted and the particles that may be released can trigger severe asthma exacerbations (thunderstorm asthma).
