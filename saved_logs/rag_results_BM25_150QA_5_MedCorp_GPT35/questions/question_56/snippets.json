        "title": "Status evaluation: enteroscopy.",
        "content": "Enteroscopy is a method to examine the small bowel mucosa beyond the reach of standard upper endoscopes. In practice it has primarily been used to search for a bleeding lesion in patients where one is not detected by conventional means. Such patients constitute only a small percentage of those who bleed (15,20). Experience is greatest with push enteroscopy. Examination of the distal duodenum and proximal jejunum using a standard or pediatric colonoscope is practical, appears to be safe and provides a satisfactory diagnostic and therapeutic yield in experienced hands. Longer designated push enteroscopes are under investigation. Sonde type enteroscopes can be passed to the ileum in most cases. A cause for bleeding can be detected in approximately one-quarter to one-third of individuals with minimal morbidity. Certain technical problems limit their efficacy and their role in the evaluation of patients with bleeding has not yet been clearly defined.",

        "content": "Push enteroscopy is performed with a long endoscope similar in design to an upper endoscope. The enteroscope is pushed down the small bowel, sometimes with the help of a stiffening overtube that extends from the mouth to the small intestine. The proximal to mid-jejunum is usually reached, and the instrument channel of the endoscope allows for biopsy or endoscopic therapy. Deeper insertion into the small bowel can be accomplished by single-or double-balloon enteroscopy or spiral enteroscopy (Fig. 345-9). These instruments enable pleating of the small intestine onto an over-tube (see Video 346e-1). With balloon-assisted enteroscopy, the entire intestinal tract can be visualized in some patients when both the oral and anal routes of insertion are used. Biopsies and endoscopic therapy can be performed throughout the visualized small bowel (Fig. 345-10).",

        "content": "Push enteroscopy or double-balloon enteroscopy is a new advancement to standard endoscopes. They have been used when the lesion is farther down in the small bowel and not seen with the standard endoscopes. It uses two balloons, which can help the scope be pushed farther into the small bowel. [22] It is possible to see the lesions, as far as the ileum, depending upon the performer's expertise. The advantage is the ability to treat, take biopsies and mark the area with the tattoo. Studies have shown that the enteroscope has identified the bleeding source in about 74% of patients and treated about 60% to 70%. [23]",
