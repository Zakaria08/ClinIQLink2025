        "title": "Neonatal Jaundice -- Treatment / Management -- Phototherapy",
        "content": "Bilirubin optimally absorbs light in the blue-green range (ie, 460-490 nm). The underlying mechanism of PT involves inducing photoisomerization and converting bilirubin into lumirubin, which is\u00a0readily excreted into bile and urine. [96] During phototherapy, the neonate's maximum body surface area should be exposed to the light source while keeping the eyes covered to avoid retinal injury, and interruptions should be minimized. The maintenance of hydration is necessary to ensure\u00a0adequate urine output, as most bilirubin is excreted in the urine as lumirubin, a structural isomer of bilirubin formed during phototherapy. Therefore, breastfeeding support should be offered to all nursing mothers as early initiation of breastfeeding and frequent, on-demand feeding decreases the likelihood of dehydration. Although supplemental oral water and dextrose water are not recommended, supplemental pumped breastmilk or infant formula can be considered\u00a0for feeding issues, including infants with ineffective sucking or latching or inadequate maternal milk production.
