        "content": "Detectors are essential in SPECT imaging, as they detect photon events and generate datasets for image reconstruction. In a single non-pixelated crystal system, the Anger camera, which uses a large thallium-doped sodium iodide crystal, is a primary\u00a0component of the SPECT camera. This crystal works in conjunction with a series of large photomultiplier tubes to convert \u03b3-rays into electronic signals. One or more of these crystal systems rotate around the patient\u2019s body. Thicker crystals offer improved sensitivity but result in lower intrinsic resolution. Typically, 9.5-mm crystals are used for technetium and thallium tracers. Other detector types include pixelated scintillation crystals with photodiode arrays and semiconductor radiation detectors.",

        "content": "CT utilizes detectors, which can be single elements or part of a larger detector array, and includes reference detectors to aid in calibration and artifact reduction. The size of the fan beam and the number of detector elements collecting data depend on the selected scan field of view. [4] Ideal detectors exhibit high efficiency in capturing transmitted photons, minimal afterglow (persistent scintillation), effective scatter suppression, and stability that eliminates frequent calibration interruptions. [5] [6] Overall detector efficiency results from multiple factors, including the stopping power of the detector material, scintillator efficiency (for solid-state detectors), charge collection efficiency (for xenon detectors), geometric efficiency (comparing detector collimator plates to surface area), and scatter rejection. [7] [4] Other terms related to detector efficiency\u00a0include\u00a0capture efficiency (the ability to acquire photons), absorption efficiency (the number of absorbed photons), response time (the time for the signal to return to zero after x-ray stimulation), and dynamic range (the ratio of the maximum to minimum measurable signals).

        "content": "Modern CT scanners primarily employ solid-state crystal detectors. At the same time, older models may utilize xenon gas detectors, which are becoming less prevalent due to limitations in multidetector row CT (MDCT) systems. Third-generation CT scanners feature a detector array and an x-ray tube that generates a fan-shaped beam, eliminating the need for beam and detector translation. [8] This design reduces scan times and motion artifacts, improving image quality, although it may lead to ring artifacts. [2] [8] Fourth-generation scanners have a fixed detector array within the gantry while the tube rotates. Despite having more detectors, this design poses challenges related to motion artifacts. To address this issue, over-scans are utilized, but they elevate patient radiation exposure. [9] Another CT design, electron beam imaging (EBCT), employs a fixed electron gun and anode target. While it offers high speed, its clinical utility is limited due to spatial resolution concerns, cost factors, and difficulty obtaining insurance reimbursement. [10] The emergence of newer multidetector-row technology has reduced the relevance of EBCT.",
