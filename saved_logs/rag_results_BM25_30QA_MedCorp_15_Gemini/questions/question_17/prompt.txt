Document 1 (Title: Prostate Cancer -- Medical Oncology -- Aggressive Prostate Cancer): Aggressive disease in prostate cancer is typically defined as either locally advanced, a higher Gleason score (Gleason 4+4=8 or higher), or a rapid PSA doubling time of 10 months or less. Treatment for aggressive prostate cancers may involve radical prostatectomy, radiation therapy, HIFU, cryosurgery, hormonal therapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, radiopharmaceuticals, or some combination of these. Early use of combinatorial therapies is helpful in many patients presenting with aggressive or advanced, localized disease. [26] [296] [321]
Document 2 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): boney structures. Modern CT PET scans have a limited role at this point.Treatment for localized prostate cancer is guided by can-cer aggressiveness and patient’s preferences. Active sur-veillance is recommended for patients with low-risk disease grade 1–2, early-stage disease (cT1c), and small volume disease as determined by biopsy. Large prospective cohorts and randomized clinical trials have established the safety of this approach.134,135 The risk of progression to metastatic disease with close follow-up and repeat prostate biopsies is less than 2% in over 12 years. Radical prostatectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection (robotic, laparoscopic, or open), image modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), and brachytherapy are the standard of care for curative treatments. All provide equal cancer specific survival for low and intermediate risk cancers. For higher risk prostate cancer patients, both surgery and IMRT with androgen 8Figure 40-11.

Document 3 (Title: Pathology_Robbins): The relatively low rate of mortality in men with prostate cancer is related in part to increased detection of the disease through screening (discussed later), but how effective screening is at saving lives is controversial. This seeming paradox is related to the wide variation in the natural history of prostate cancer, from aggressive and rapidly fatal to indolent disease of no clinical significance. Indeed, prostate carcinoma commonly is found incidentally at autopsy in men dying of other causes, and many more men die with prostate cancer than of prostate cancer. It is not currently possible to identify the tumors that will be “bad actors” with certainty; thus, while some men are no doubt saved by early detection and treatment of their prostate cancers, it is equally certain that others are being “cured” of clinically inconsequential tumors.
Document 4 (Title: Prostate Cancer -- Prognosis -- Do We Absolutely, Positively Need to Have a Positive Prostate Tissue Biopsy to Treat Prostate Cancer?): With the use of MRI imaging, genomic analysis, validated prostatic nomograms, and all of the other pre-biopsy predictive tests, it is feasible to consider initiating some degree of prostate cancer treatment in selected cases even without absolute histological confirmation of malignancy if the likelihood of cancer is sufficiently high. Such cases are likely to be infrequent, and patients must be thoroughly informed about the standard of care and the potential risks and benefits of treatment without absolute confirmation of an aggressive prostatic malignancy.

Document 6 (Title: Prostate Cancer -- Evaluation -- Genomic (Somatic) Tumor Biomarkers (Post-Biopsy)): Prolaris test: This test was the first commercially available genomic tumor marker to evaluate prostate cancer aggressiveness. [217] The Prolaris test analyzes 46 genes and specifically measures the RNA expression of 31 genes involved in cell cycle progression. The test is designed to indicate the risk of biochemical recurrence and prostate cancer-specific mortality over the next 10 years when combined with the PSA level, clinical stage, percentage of positive biopsy cores, biopsy grade group, and AUA risk group. [212] In a large prospective registry, the Prolaris test changed the initial treatment selection in 47.8% of 1600 participants, with 75% opting for a less aggressive therapy and 25% choosing a more definitive treatment option. [218] The test is most useful in facilitating decision-making for individuals with localized disease and low- or intermediate-risk cancers (both favorable and unfavorable) who are considering active surveillance versus definitive treatment. Prolaris can identify cancer-specific mortality for men on active surveillance and with biochemical recurrence for those who have had radiation therapy or undergone TURP surgery. [144] [212] Similar to the Decipher test, the Prolaris test is also useful in patients after radical prostatectomy surgery and in high-risk cases for prognostic purposes. [212]
Document 7 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): around the 5and 8-year survival distributions for the two groups overlapped. A large randomized study comparing early to late hormone treatment (orchiectomy or GnRH analogue) in patients with locally advanced or asymptomatic metastatic disease showed that patients treated early were less likely to progress from M0 to M1 disease, to develop pain, and to die of prostate cancer. This trial was criticized because therapy was delayed “too long” in the late-treatment group. Noteworthy is that the American Society of Clinical Oncology Guidelines recommend deferring treatment until the disease has recurred and the prognosis has been reassessed. These guidelines do not support immediate therapy.
Document 8 (Title: Localized Prostate Cancer -- Introduction): Men with low-grade tumors rarely die from prostate cancer. They are much more likely to die from other causes first. On the other hand, men with high-grade disease are more likely to die from prostate cancer within ten years without radical treatment. The prognosis of men with intermediate-risk cancer is the most difficult to predict. The perceived increased risk of mortality compared to low-risk disease can often push clinicians towards radical treatment in these cases. Still, such a strategy has been challenged by the findings of studies such as the ProtecT study of treatments for localized prostate cancer. Prognostic markers and scoring will likely be of great interest to this group of patients. [8]
Document 9 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): The prostate cancer continuum—from the appearance of a preneoplastic and invasive lesion localized to the prostate, to a metastatic lesion that results in symptoms and, ultimately, mortality—can span decades. To facilitate disease management, competing risks are considered in the context of a series of clinical states (Fig. 115-1). The states are defined operationally on the basis of whether or not a cancer diagnosis has been established and, for those with a diagnosis, whether or not metastases are detectable on imaging studies and the measured level of testosterone in the blood. With this approach, an individual resides in only one state and remains in that state until he has progressed. At each assessment, the decision to offer treatment and the specific form of treatment are based on the risk posed by the cancer relative to competing causes of mortality that may be present in that individual. It follows that the more advanced the disease, the greater is the need for treatment.
Document 10 (Title: Localized Prostate Cancer -- Prognosis): Despite being common, prostate cancer has the highest 5-year survival of all cancers at 98%. As previously discussed, localized prostate cancer is frequently indolent and has an excellent prognosis even if left untreated. By definition, patients with high-grade, high-volume cancer are more likely to progress to locally advanced and metastatic disease, but risks can be mitigated by early detection and treatment.
Document 11 (Title: Prostate Cancer -- Treatment / Management -- Focal Ablation Therapy for Localized Prostate Cancer): However, the effectiveness of focal ablative therapy in controlling or curing localized prostate cancer remains uncertain. The choice of technology and its efficacy in providing optimal cancer control with minimal adverse effects is still under investigation. Currently, focal ablative therapies for localized prostate cancer are considered investigational in the United States. HIFU is a local treatment modality that uses focused ultrasound to heat and ablate prostatic tissue, including isolated malignant lesions. Although not specifically approved for prostate cancer use in the United States, it has been used for this purpose in other parts of the world with reasonably good results in selected patients. This method is inexpensive, avoids radiation, can be repeated if necessary, and has minimal adverse effects. However, its long-term efficacy and role in prostate cancer treatment are still being evaluated. [231] [233] [234] [235]
Document 12 (Title: Gynecology_Novak): The use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy traditionally was limited to those individuals with either inoperable locally advanced or inﬂammatory breast cancers. The goal of preoperative systemic therapy was to convert inoperable patients into resectable candidates on the basis of pathologic and clinical responses (105). Indications for neoadjuvant chemotherapy were broadened to include individuals presenting with large operable tumors and wanting to undergo breast preservation instead of mastectomy. Reports indicate that breast conservation therapy is possible and that low rates of in-breast or local–regional recurrences occur when neoadjuvant chemotherapy results in clinical and pathological tumor downstaging (106). In addition to large, operable tumors, neoadjuvant therapy continues to have a role in the treatment of inﬂammatory breast cancers and those presenting in a locally advanced state.
Document 13 (Title: First_Aid_Step2): Look for metastases with CXR and bone scan (metastatic lesions show an osteoblastic or ↑ bone density). Fully 40% of patients present with metastatic disease at diagnosis. Treatment is controversial, as many cases of prostate cancer are slow to progress. Treatment choice is based on the aggressiveness of the tumor and the patient’s mortality risk. Watchful waiting may be the best approach for elderly patients with low-grade tumors. Radical prostatectomy and radiation therapy (e.g., brachytherapy or external beam) are associated with an ↑ risk of incontinence and/or impotence. PSA, while controversial as a screening test, is used to follow patients post-treatment to evaluate for disease recurrence. Treat metastatic disease with androgen ablation (e.g., GnRH agonists, orchiectomy, ﬂutamide) and chemotherapy.
Document 14 (Title: Localized Prostate Cancer -- Treatment / Management): Localized prostate cancer represents a paradox in that when left untreated, it is generally associated with a good prognosis. However, because prostate cancer is a common cause of cancer-related mortality, there is usually significant patient anxiety once the diagnosis is confirmed. All standard treatments carry risks of adverse events that might negatively impact short-, medium-, or long-term quality of life. As such, the clinical approach to managing localized prostate cancer must take into account not only the disease features, such as stage, grade, and volume of cancer detected, but also patient co-morbidities, life expectancy, and priorities.
Document 15 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Clinically localized prostate cancers are those that appear to be nonmetastatic after staging studies are performed. Patients with clinically localized disease are managed by radical prostatectomy, radiation therapy, or active surveillance. Choice of therapy requires the consideration of several factors: the presence of symptoms, the probability that the untreated tumor will adversely affect the quality or duration of survival and thus require treatment, and the probability that the tumor can be cured by single-modality therapy directed at the prostate or that it will require both local and systemic therapy to achieve cure.
