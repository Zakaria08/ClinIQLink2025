Document 1 (Title: Lymphocytosis -- Etiology): Infectious: Viral infections: Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV): Infectious Mononucleosis (IM) is a classic example of viral infections associated with lymphocytosis. Acute IM is a disease characterized by fever, lymphadenopathy, pharyngitis, splenomegaly, and various hematologic manifestations, among which lymphocytosis is the most common and presents in up to two-thirds of cases. [1] Cytomegalovirus (CMV): CMV can cause a disease indistinguishable from EBV IM. Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV): Although chronic HIV infection resulted in lymphopenia and decreased CD4+ lymphocytes count, primary HIV infection can lead to an acute febrile mononucleosis-like illness with associated lymphocytosis. A negative heterophile test can help distinguish the two. [2] Other Viruses: Influenza, hepatitis, mumps, measles, rubella, and human T Lymphocytic virus type 1 (HTLV-1), adenovirus, to name a few. Bacterial Infections: Most of the acute bacterial infections will cause neutrophilia; however, notable exceptions include: Bartonella henselae : Bartonella henselae leads to cat scratch disease, a disease transmitted by scratch or bite from an infected cat, that leads mostly to self-limited lymphadenopathy, but can be associated with ocular or neurologic manifestations. Lymphocytes are large and atypical. Bordetella Pertussis : Pertussis is characterized by increased lymphocytes that are small with a deeply cleaved nucleus, clinical correlation is needed to differentiate from some lymphoid malignancies that might share the morphologic appearance. Other: Brucellosis, syphilis, malaria Parasitic Infections: Toxoplasma Gondii: symptomatic  toxoplasmosis occurs most commonly in immunocompromised hosts. Lymphocytosis with atypical lymphocytes is a hematologic hallmark of the disease, that can present as a mononucleosis-like illness. [3] Other: Babesiosis Mycobacterial Tuberculosis
Document 2 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Differential Diagnosis Whereas ~90% of cases of IM are due to EBV, 5–10% of cases are due to cytomegalovirus (CMV) (Chap. 219). CMV is the most common cause of heterophile-negative mononucleosis; less common causes of IM and differences from IM due to EBV are shown in Table 218-2. Therapy for IM consists of supportive measures, with rest and analgesia. Excessive physical activity during the first month should be avoided to reduce the possibility of splenic rupture, which often necessitates splenectomy. Glucocorticoid therapy is not indicated for uncomplicated IM and in fact may predispose to bacterial superinfection. Prednisone (40–60 mg/d for 2–3 days, with subsequent tapering of the dose over 1–2 weeks) has been used for the prevention of airway obstruction in patients with severe tonsillar hypertrophy, for Epstein-Barr Virus Infections, Including Infectious Mononucleosis Time of symptoms
Document 3 (Title: Pathology_Robbins): Clinical Features. Infectious mononucleosis classically manifests with fever, sore throat, and lymphadenitis, but atypical presentations are not unusual. Sometimes there is little or no fever and only fatigue and lymphadenopathy exist, raising the specter of lymphoma; fever of unknown origin, unassociated with lymphadenopathy or other localized findings; hepatitis that is difficult to differentiate from one of the hepatotropic viral syndromes (Chapter 16); or a febrile rash resembling rubella. Ultimately, the diagnosis depends on the following, in increasing order of specificity: (1) the presence of atypical lymphocytes in the peripheral blood; (2) a positive heterophil reaction (Monospot test); and (3) a rising titer of antibodies specific for EBV antigens. In most patients, mononucleosis resolves within 4 to 6 weeks, but sometimes the fatigue lasts longer. Occasionally, one or more complications supervene. Perhaps the most common of these is hepatic dysfunction, associated with
Document 4 (Title: Pathology_Robbins): Infectious mononucleosis is an acute, self-limited disease of adolescents and young adults that is caused by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a member of the herpesvirus family. The infection is characterized by (1) fever, sore throat, and generalized lymphadenitis and (2) a lymphocytosis of activated, CD8+ T cells. Of note, cytomegalovirus infection induces a similar syndrome that can be differentiated only by serologic methods.
Document 5 (Title: Pediatrics_Nelson): The characteristic triad of EBV infectious mononucleosis is fever, pharyngitis, and lymphadenopathy. The pharynx shows enlarged tonsils and exudate and, sometimes, anenanthem with pharyngeal petechiae. Lymphadenopathy ismost prominent in the anterior and posterior cervical andsubmandibular lymph nodes and less commonly involvesaxillary and inguinal lymph nodes. Other findings includesplenomegaly in 50% of cases, hepatomegaly in 10% to 20%, and maculopapular or urticarial rash in 5% to 15%. A diffuse,erythematous rash develops in approximately 80% of mononucleosis patients treated with amoxicillin. Compared with EBV infection, infectious mononucleosis-like illness caused by CMV has minimal pharyngitis and often more prominentsplenomegaly; it often presents with fever only. The mostcommon manifestation of toxoplasmosis is asymptomaticcervical lymphadenopathy, but approximately 10% of casesof acquired toxoplasmosis develop chronic posterior cervical lymphadenopathy and fatigue, usually
Document 6 (Title: Pediatrics_Nelson): and, if sustained, bacterial infections. Transient lymphopenia at the beginning of illness and lasting 24 to 48 hours has been described with many viral infections. Atypical lymphocytes are mature T lymphocytes with larger, eccentrically placed, and indented nuclei classically seen with infectious mononucleosis caused by Epstein-Barr virus. Other infections associated with atypical lymphocytosis include cytomegalovirus infection, toxoplasmosis, viral hepatitis, rubella, roseola, mumps, and some drug reactions. Eosinophilia is characteristic of allergic diseases but may be seen with tissue-invasive multicellular parasites, such as the migration of the larval stages of parasites through skin, connective tissue, and viscera. High-grade eosinophilia (>30% eosinophils, or a total eosinophil count >3000/μL) frequently occurs during the muscle invasion phase
Document 7 (Title: Viral Infections of the Oral Mucosa -- Etiology -- Infectious Mononucleosis): Mononucleosis is caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV or HHV-4). The Epstein-Barr virus is associated with primary infections but also neoplastic processes. [11] The pathogenesis of mononucleosis primarily involves the infection of B-cells in the oropharyngeal mucosa, where the virus may remain latent. [8] [2] [4]

Document 9 (Title: Adenopathy -- Differential Diagnosis): Infectious: Many different infections can contribute to benign changes in the lymph nodes. Health care providers may consider several different subcategories of infection, including bacterial, viral, and other: Bacterial: brucellosis, cat-scratch disease, bacterial pharyngitis, syphilis, tuberculosis, tularemia, typhoid fever Viral: cytomegalovirus, hepatitis, herpes simplex, HIV, mononucleosis, rubella, viral pharyngitis. [16] Other: bubonic plague, blastomycosis, coccidioidomycosis, cryptococcosis, histoplasmosis, toxoplasmosis
Document 10 (Title: Nephritic Syndrome -- Etiology): A similar form of glomerulonephritis (infection associated) may occur in association with certain infections, e.g., bacterial infections (meningococcemia, staphylococcal endocarditis, and pneumococcal pneumonia, etc.), viral infections (mainly hepatitis B, hepatitis C, mumps, HIV infection, varicella, and EBV causing infectious mononucleosis), and parasitic infections (malaria and toxoplasmosis).
Document 11 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): PART 2 Cardinal Manifestations and Presentation of Diseases mononucleosis (Epstein-Barr virus [EBV] or cytomegalovirus [CMV]), toxoplasmosis, AIDS, other viral infections, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and mixed connective tissue disease. Acute and chronic lymphocytic leukemias and malignant lymphomas also produce generalized adenopathy in adults.
Document 12 (Title: Granulomatous Uveitis -- Etiology -- Infectious Causes): Tuberculosis Syphilis Herpes viruses [2] Cytomegalovirus [3] Lyme disease [4] Toxoplasmosis [5] Toxocariasis [6] Trematodes [7] Propionibacterium acnes [8] Post-streptococcal infections [9] Some fungal infections including following coronavirus disease-2019: candida, histoplasmosis, and cryptococcosis [10] [11] [12] [11] [13] [11]
Document 13 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Most lymphadenopathy patients do not require a biopsy, and at least half require no laboratory studies. If the patient’s history and physical findings point to a benign cause for lymphadenopathy, careful follow-up at a 2to 4-week interval can be used. The patient should be instructed to return for reevaluation if there is an increase in the size of the nodes. Antibiotics are not indicated for lymphadenopathy unless strong evidence of a bacterial infection is present. Glucocorticoids should not be used to treat lymphadenopathy because their lympholytic effect obscures some diagnoses (lymphoma, leukemia, Castleman’s disease), and they contribute to delayed healing or activation of underlying infections. An exception to this statement is the life-threatening pharyngeal obstruction by enlarged lymphoid tissue in Waldeyer’s ring that is occasionally seen in infectious mononucleosis.

Document 14 (Title: Pediatrics_Nelson): F. tularensis (ulceroglandular tularemia) B. henselae (cat-scratch disease) Y. pestis (plague) Nocardia (nocardiosis) Cutaneous diphtheria (Corynebacterium diphtherial) Cutaneous coccidioidomycosis (Coccidioides immitis) Cutaneous histoplasmosis (Histoplasma capsulatum) Cutaneous leishmaniasis Cutaneous sporotrichosis (S. schenckii) 20% of healthy individuals shedding EBV at any given time. Cytomegalovirus (CMV), Toxoplasma gondii, adenoviruses, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, and initial human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, known as acute retroviral syndrome, can cause an infectious mononucleosis-like syndrome with lymphadenopathy.
Document 15 (Title: Viral Infections of the Oral Mucosa -- Etiology -- Infectious Mononucleosis): The primary transmission mode is via close contact with oral secretions due to viral shedding in saliva. [2] The most common clinical manifestation of infectious mononucleosis, also referred to as "kissing disease" or "glandular fever," is most often seen in adolescent patients. [3]
