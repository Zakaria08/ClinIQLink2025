Document 1 (Title: Cervical Cancer -- Evaluation): Colposcopy is the diagnostic procedure of choice for evaluating abnormal cytology and/or persistent high-risk HPV infection. The American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology (ASCCP) has issued guidance on procedural indications, and their recommended algorithms are considered standard of care. Multiple colposcopic-guided biopsies and endocervical sampling are often indicated, except during pregnancy. [21] Abnormal colposcopic findings may include acetowhite color change with the application of acetic acid, rich vascularity, atypical vessels, mosaicism, and punctation (see Image. Invasive Cervical Cancer).
Document 2 (Title: Gynecology_Novak): Figure 19.10 Human papillomavirus (HPV)/cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2 (CIN 2) presents as a white lesion with surface spicules. Mosaic Terminal capillaries surrounding roughly circular or polygonal-shaped blocks of acetowhite epithelium crowded together are called mosaic because their appearance is similar to mosaic tile (Fig. 19.11). These vessels form a “basket” around the blocks of abnormal epithelium. They may arise from a coalescence of many terminal punctate vessels or from the vessels that surround the cervical gland openings (5). Mosaicism tends to be associated with higher-grade lesions and CIN 2 (Fig. 19.12) and CIN 3 (Fig. 19.13). Atypical Vascular Pattern Atypical vascular patterns are characteristic of invasive cervical cancer and include looped vessels, branching vessels, and reticular vessels.
Document 3 (Title: Gynecology_Novak): CHAPTER 19 Intraepithelial Disease of the Cervix, Vagina, and Vulva Figure 19.11 A: Mosaic pattern and punctation. This pattern develops as islands of dysplastic epithelium proliferate and push the ends of the superficial blood vessels away, creating a pattern that looks like mosaic tiles.

Document 4 (Title: Gynecology_Novak): Figure 19.8 Colposcopy of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2 (CIN 2) associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection of the cervix. Punctation Dilated capillaries terminating on the surface appear from the ends as a collection of dots and are referred to as punctation (Fig. 19.9). When these vessels occur in a well-demarcated area of acetowhite epithelium, they indicate an abnormal epithelium— most often CIN (5) (Fig. 19.10). The punctate vessels are formed as the metaplastic epithelium migrates over the columnar villi. Normally, the capillary regresses; however, when CIN occurs, the capillary persists and appears more prominent. Figure 19.9 Diagram of punctation. The central capillaries of the columnar villi are preserved and produce the punctate vessels on the surface. Figure 19.10 Human papillomavirus (HPV)/cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2 (CIN 2) presents as a white lesion with surface spicules.
Document 5 (Title: Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia -- Pathophysiology): Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia results from HPV infection within cervical cells. These changes, especially in young women, commonly revert to normal cells due to an intact immune response and rapid turnover of cells on the cervix. About 60% of CIN-1 will regress to normal after 1 year. Women with CIN-2 and CIN-3 are at high risk for developing invasive cancer, although the average time for progression is still several years. Therefore, women with CIN-2/3 should receive treatment. Exceptions to this recommendation are women in the 20 to 24 year age group and pregnant women.  Since a significant percentage of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LGSIL) on Pap smear will have CIN-2 or 3, it makes sense that these pap smears still require colposcopy and biopsy in most cases. The same holds for older women with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) pap smears who also have a high-risk HPV. Cytology is the screening test, but histologic characteristics of a tissue biopsy make the diagnosis. [1] [8]
Document 6 (Title: Gynecology_Novak): All CIN 2 and 3 lesions require treatment in women 21 years of age and older (75). This recommendation is based on a meta-analysis showing that CIN 2 progresses to CIS in 20% of cases and to invasion in 5%. Progression of CIS to invasion is 5% (90).

Document 7 (Title: Gynecology_Novak): Abnormal Blood Vessels Abnormal vessels may be looped, branched, or reticular. Abnormal looped vessels are the most common colposcopic finding and arise from the punctated and mosaic vessels present in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). As the neoplastic growth process proceeds and the need for oxygen and nutrition increases, angiogenesis occurs as a result of tumor and local tissue production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF),
Document 8 (Title: Cervical Ectropion -- Evaluation): Nucleic acid amplification tests for chlamydia and gonorrheal cervicitis. Triple swab. Endocervical and high vaginal swabs are taken to rule out cervicitis. It is mainly done when vaginal discharge is purulent. Differentiating between cervical ectropion and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and cervical cancer is difficult on macroscopic visualization. Though cervical ectropion is not associated with cervical cancer, in the case of cervical pain or spotting along with a red, inflamed cervix, the following tests can be done to rule out cervicitis, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), and cervical cancer: [18] [22] [23] Pap smear Colposcopy Colposcopy with biopsy A urine beta hCG qualitative test is carried out as the reproductive hormonal pattern during pregnancy often leads to the development of cervical ectropion.
Document 9 (Title: Vaginal Cancer -- Evaluation): There are no routine screening indications for vaginal cancer. If cervical cytology is abnormal and no cervical lesions are seen, evaluation for vaginal lesions should be undertaken. Vaginal cytology after hysterectomy for benign disease is not indicated due to low yield and high false positive rates. However, long-term surveillance is suggested after a hysterectomy for high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. This is especially true for immunologically compromised individuals. [25] [26] Low-grade VAIN does not require treatment and can be followed with cytology and colposcopy. [27]
Document 10 (Title: Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia -- Treatment / Management): As stated earlier, CIN -2 or higher requires treatment. Treatment is also recommended when there is more than one degree of difference between pap results and biopsy results. For example, if the pap smear is high-grade intraepithelial lesion (HGSIL), but the biopsy is negative, the potential reasons are a misread of the specimen, or there was a missed a lesion at the time of colposcopy. In this case, a diagnostic excisional procedure is the preferred mode of treatment because it is both therapeutic and diagnostic. The margins of the cervical specimen may then undergo evaluation for complete removal of any abnormal cells. [1]
Document 11 (Title: High-Grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion of the Cervix -- Continuing Education Activity): High-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) encompasses the conditions previously termed cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grades 2 and 3 (CIN 2 and CIN 3), moderate and severe dysplasia, and carcinoma in situ. HSIL is a squamous cell abnormality associated with human papillomavirus (HPV). Though not all HSILs will progress to cancer, HSIL is considered a precancerous lesion and is usually treated aggressively. The epidemiology, risk factors, and clinical presentation of HSILs are discussed. Participants will understand current diagnostic techniques, including cervical cytology, human papillomavirus (HPV) testing, and colposcopy, enabling clinicians to accurately identify and classify HSILs. Management strategies for HSILs, including both surgical and non-surgical approaches, will be addressed.

Document 13 (Title: Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia -- Evaluation): Colposcopy with directed biopsy is the preferred method for evaluation of an abnormal pap smear result. "Co-testing" combines cytology and HPV testing for high-risk types, but is still considered screening. The diagnosis ultimately requires tissue sampling. There are exceptions to this rule:
