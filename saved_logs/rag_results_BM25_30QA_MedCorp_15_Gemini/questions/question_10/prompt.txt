Document 1 (Title: Cell_Biology_Alberts): thousands of caspase substrates have been identified. Which ones are the critical proteins that must be cleaved to trigger the major cell remodeling events underlying apoptosis? how did the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis evolve, and what is the advantage of having mitochondria play such a central role in regulating apoptosis? how are “don’t eat me” signals eliminated or inactivated during apoptosis to allow the cells to be phagocytosed? Which statements are true? Explain why or why not. 18–1 In normal adult tissues, cell death usually balances cell division. 18–2 Mammalian cells that do not have cytochrome c should be resistant to apoptosis induced by DNA damage. Discuss the following problems.
Document 2 (Title: Pathology_Robbins): (glucose, glutamine, ISCHEMIA, ATP Lipid, protein building blocks Fig. 1.11 Roles of the mitochondria. Besides the efficient generation of ATP from carbohydrate and fatty acid substrates, mitochondria play an important role in intermediary metabolism, serving as the source of molecules used to synthesize lipids and proteins, and they also are centrally involved in cell life and-death decisions. Mitochondria provide the enzymatic machinery for oxidative phosphorylation (and thus the relatively efficient generation of energy from glucose and fatty acid substrates). They also have central roles in anabolic metabolism and the regulation programmed cell death, so-called “apoptosis” ( Fig. 1.11
Document 3 (Title: Myocardial Protection -- Anatomy and Physiology -- Mitochondrial Protection): Mitochondrial protection is crucial because mitochondria, while providing ATP to cardiomyocytes, also play a central role in activating cell death pathways. The mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) is a nonselective channel in the inner mitochondrial membrane that remains closed during ischemia-induced acidosis, offering some protection. However, if the mPTP opens, it leads to depolarization, uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation, intracellular ATP depletion, and cell death. Protecting the heart during ischemia focuses on preventing mPTP opening and promoting the activation of the mitochondrial ATP-dependent potassium channel. This invokes 2 primary protective pathways: the reperfusion injury salvage kinase pathway, activated via G-protein-coupled receptors, and the survivor-activating factor enhancement pathway, which operates through tumor necrosis factor-alpha receptors.
Document 4 (Title: Histology, Periosteum And Endosteum -- Function): Bone modeling and remodeling: Periosteum, endosteum, and its cells play a critical role in modeling and remodeling. Bone remodeling is a process where osteoclasts and osteoblasts work sequentially to reshape and renew bone; the process continues throughout life. It divides into four phases; (a) recruitment and activation of osteoclasts, (b) resorption of old bony tissue, (c) apoptosis of osteoclasts, and activation of osteoblasts (d) laying of new organic matrix and mineralization. [37] [38] [39] Bone modeling is a process to shape the bone during growth, development, and healing. Mechanical factors like stress, strain, tension, muscular attachment, etc. play an important role in bone modeling. Osteoblasts and osteoclast play an independent role in bone modeling. [37] [11] [37]
Document 5 (Title: Cardiac Electrical and Structural Remodeling -- Introduction): Even with the falling rates of cardiovascular deaths, the events of deaths attributable to sudden cardiac death keep rising. [1] A total of 350000 events of sudden cardiac death are estimated to occur in the United States every year. Coronary artery disease often leads to complex electrical and structural remodeling of the heart due to myocardial injury. This remodeling is the root cause that precipitates ventricular arrhythmias, which often lead to sudden cardiac death. Cardiac remodeling occurs in response to stress, either functional stress or structural stress. This remodeling plays a vital role in the disease process that ensues. Initially, the electrical and structural remodeling helps in compensating the cardiac performance. But over time, these compensatory mechanisms often lead to pump failure and/or fatal arrhythmias. [2] Both atria and ventricles are affected by electrical remodeling. This process eventually leads to atrial fibrillation and fatal ventricular arrhythmias. [3] Structural remodeling of the heart can be physiologic growth occurring in response to exercise, pregnancy, or during the postnatal period. It can also be pathologic hypertrophy in response to neurohumoral activation, injury to myocardium, or hypertension. Heart failure and malignant arrhythmia are often precipitated by pathological hypertrophy of the heart. However, they don’t occur with the physiological growth of the heart. [2]
Document 6 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): to nutrient deprivation, or consti-tutive activation of autophagy in response to stress, can lead to cell death; thus, autophagy is sometimes referred to as a second form of programmed cell death. Autophagy plays an essential role during starvation, cellular differentiation, cell death, and aging. Autophagy is also involved in the elimination of cancer cells by triggering a nonapoptotic cell death program, which suggests a negative role in tumor development. Mouse models that are heterozygotes for the beclin 1 gene, an important gene for autophagy, have altered autophagic response and show a high incidence of spontaneous tumors, which establishes a role for autophagy in tumor suppression.21 This also suggests that mutations in other genes operating in this pathway may con-tribute to tumor formation through deregulation of autophagy. However, autophagy also acts as a stress response mechanism to protect cancer cells from low nutrient supply or therapeu-tic insults. Thus, in cancer,
Document 7 (Title: Physiology, Growth Factor -- Cellular Level -- Wound Healing and Growth Factors): Wound healing is a normal, multiphase, physiological process and is of obvious importance after surgery. Growth factors play critical roles in all three phases of wound healing: (1) the inflammatory phase, (2) the proliferative phase, and (3) the remodeling phase. Platelets are the principal cell type for the inflammatory phase because they release platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and TGF-beta, both of which are growth factors that attract macrophages and neutrophils. Neutrophils are white blood cells that can kill bacteria and thereby prevent sepsis at the wound site. Macrophages secrete growth factors that both attract fibroblasts and also play a key role in the second phase of wound healing, the proliferative phase. TGF-beta is also secreted by macrophages and plays a role in wound fibrosis. Both macrophages and endothelial cells can secrete VEGF, and this growth factor promotes angiogenesis (growth of new blood vessels). Macrophages also secrete epidermal growth factor (EGF), and it stimulates fibroblasts to secrete collagenase, which is essential during the remodeling phase. There is evidence suggesting that the complex and changing mixture of growth factors occurring during wound healing modulates macrophage functions. [6] [7]
Document 8 (Title: Vincristine -- Indications): Vincristine is a member of the vinca alkaloids group, which consists of organic compounds composed of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen. These compounds are derived from the periwinkle plant Catharanthus roseus , formerly known as Vinca rosea . [1] Vincristine has a complex polycyclic structure comprising 3 rings, a structural feature crucial for its biological activity. This drug inhibits cell growth by halting mitosis and disrupting the polymerization of microtubules. Microtubules play a vital role in cell division, intracellular transport, and maintaining cellular shape. Vincristine binds to the tubulin protein, the building block of microtubules, and prevents its polymerization into microtubules. [2] This disrupts the formation of the mitotic spindle, which is essential for chromosome segregation during cell division. Consequently, vincristine induces cell cycle arrest and triggers apoptosis (cell death) in rapidly dividing cancer cells.
Document 9 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, plays an important role in both physiologic and pathologic conditions. During embryogenesis, apoptotic pathways operate to destroy neurons that fail to differentiate appropriately or reach their intended targets. There is mounting evidence for an increased rate of apoptotic cell death in a variety of acute and chronic neurologic diseases. Apoptosis is characterized by neuronal shrinkage, chromatin condensation, and DNA fragmentation, whereas necrotic cell death is associated with cytoplasmic and mitochondrial swelling followed by dissolution of the cell membrane. Apoptotic and necrotic cell death can coexist or be sequential events, depending on the severity of the initiating insult. Cellular energy reserves appear to have an important role in these two forms of cell death, with apoptosis favored under conditions in which ATP levels are preserved. Evidence of DNA fragmentation has been found in a number of degenerative neurologic disorders,
Document 10 (Title: Necrosis -- Mechanisms): Necrotic death is almost always associated with an inflammatory response. Necrotic cells release factors like high mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1), and hepatoma-derived growth factor (HDGF). [18] [19] These factors are sensed by a nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3), which is a core protein of the inflammasome. [20] This results in inflammasome activation and causes the release of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL1β. NLRP3 inflammasome activation is triggered mainly through ATP produced by mitochondria released from damaged cells. [21] Necrosis does not typically correlate with activation of caspases, and it appears that it causes cell demise in response to damage or pathology, but not during normal development. Despite this, it turns out that a programmed form of necrotic death (termed necroptosis ) is very common in vivo, mainly in diverse forms of neurodegeneration and death inflicted by ischemia or infection. Unlike unordered necrosis, necroptosis is a more physiological and programmed type of necroptotic death and shares several key processes with apoptosis. It occurs due to the activation of the kinase domain of the receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1) and the assembly of the RIP1/RIP3-containing signaling complex. It is triggered by tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family members, needs caspase 8 inhibition, and assembly of necrosome (RIPK1-RIPK3 complex IIb). [9] [19]
Document 11 (Title: Bacterial Sepsis -- Histopathology): The cellular and tissue changes induced by a shock are essentially those also seen in hypoxic injury states. As oxygen tension within the cell decreases, there is a loss of oxidative phosphorylation and decreased generation of ATP. The sodium pump fails, and potassium is lost with a concurrent influx of sodium and water, causing the cell to swell in size. With worsening hypoxia, there is a progressive loss of glycogen and decreased protein synthesis. As hypoxic injury continues, the cytoskeleton will disperse, and “blebs” will appear. Mitochondria will also exhibit swelling at this stage while the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) remains dilated. If oxygen is restored, a lot of these processes and injuries can be reversed. If hypoxia persists, irreversible injury and cellular necrosis will ensue. Cells at this stage exhibit severe swelling of mitochondria, extensive damage to plasma membranes, and swelling of lysosomes. Cellular death is mainly by necrosis. However, apoptosis also contributes as the mitochondria are believed to leak pro-apoptotic enzymes with swelling. Apoptosis is a pathway of cellular death that is induced by a tightly regulated program that uses its own enzymes to degrade the rest of the cell in the hopes of limiting collateral tissue damage.
Document 12 (Title: Neurology_Adams): At the cellular level, several processes characterize the death of individual cells. Among these mechanism is apoptosis, a term borrowed from embryology to specify the mechanisms that lead to neuronal degeneration. The original meaning of the term refers to a naturally occurring cell death during development that is driven by the expression of genes over a short period of time (i.e., “programmed” cell death), leaving no trace of a pathologic reaction. The process of neuronal degeneration is quite different in that it refers to a series of changes in mature neurons that occur over a protracted period of time, leading to cell death and often leaving a discrete glial scar, but not to regional tissue necrosis. In some models of degenerative disease, cell loss involves activation of specialized genes, although the time course and cellular morphology are not apoptotic in the original sense of the term. It is increasingly apparent that mechanisms other than programmed cell death will prove
Document 13 (Title: New York State Infection Control -- Issues of Concern -- Histopathology): The cellular and tissue changes induced by a shock are essentially those also seen in hypoxic injury states.

Document 14 (Title: Cell_Biology_Alberts): The growth, development, and maintenance of multicellular organisms depend not only on the production of cells but also on mechanisms to destroy them. The maintenance of tissue size, for example, requires that cells die at the same rate as they are produced. During development, carefully orchestrated patterns of cell death help determine the size and shape of limbs and other tissues. Cells also die when they become damaged or infected, ensuring that they are removed before they threaten the health of the organism. In these and most other cases, cell death is not a random process but occurs by a programmed sequence of molecular events, in which the cell systematically destroys itself from within and is then eaten by other cells, leaving no trace. In most cases, this programmed cell death occurs by a process called apoptosis—from the Greek word meaning “falling off,” as leaves from a tree.
Document 15 (Title: Biochemistry, Superoxides -- Mechanism): The innate immune system, the body’s first line of defense, has an essential role in maintaining homeostasis. The phagocytic NADPH oxidase plays an important role in eliminating engulfed bacteria, specifically via the production of ROS. [24] Researchers have also demonstrated that superoxide can be released to the extracellular matrix to destroy pathogens. While performing this function, it also increases vascular permeability and cell death. [20] The activation of MAPK pathways by superoxide is also involved in the pro-inflammatory signal transduction, with this molecule acting as a second messenger. [20] The exact effects of this stimulation depend on the cellular environment, nitric oxide, superoxide concentrations, and other factors. [20] Superoxide also plays a role in the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis through the phosphorylation of ERK and ASK1, subsequently increasing the proton leak from the mitochondria. [6]
