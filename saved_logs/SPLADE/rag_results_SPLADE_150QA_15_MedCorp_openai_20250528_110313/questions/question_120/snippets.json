The citrate ion forms complexes with metallic cations. The stability constants for the formation of these complexes are quite large because of the chelate effect. Consequently, it forms complexes even with alkali metal cations. However, when a chelate complex is formed using all three carboxylate groups, the chelate rings have 7 and 8 members, which are generally less stable thermodynamically than smaller chelate rings. In consequence, the hydroxyl group can be deprotonated, forming part of a more stable 5-membered ring, as in ammonium ferric citrate, \u00b72. Citric acid can be esterified at one or more of its three carboxylic acid groups to form any of a variety of mono-, di-, tri-, and mixed esters. Biochemistry Citric acid cycle",

        "content": "Complex U, which contains the last two enzymes (orotate phosphoribosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.10) and orotidylate decarboxylase (EC 4.1.23)) of the six enzymes for the de novo biosynthesis of UMP, has been purified 200-fold from mouse Ehrlich ascites cells. The specific activity of the orotate phosphoribosyltransferase and the orotidylate decarboxylase activities of the complex were 0.115 and 0.290 mumol of product/mg of protein/min; the recovery of the activities was high being 20 to 30%. The rate of the two activities remained similar to that of the homogenate. At the sixth step of the fractionation, one can obtain a fraction that has lost phosphoribosyltransferase activity but retains decarboxylase activity. The apparent molecular weights, as determined by density gradient centrifugation, of the native complex and the fraction containing only decarboxylase activity are identical, 55,700 +/- 4,000. Both activities of complex U are labile to very mild treatments such as dilution, dialysis, or storage at 3 degrees. Dithiothreitol and 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PP-Rib-P), but not orotic acid or MgCl2, can stabilize either or both of the enzyme activities. The degree of stabilization by three of these chemicals varies with the reagent(s) used, with the nature of the treatment, and with the concentration of Complex U. When PP-Rib-P, Mg2+ and dithiothreitol are present in the diluting buffer the activity losses were slowed and then followed by a partial recovery of the phosphoribosyltransferase activity. Maximum activities of both enzymes are observed by adding undiluted complex to a complete reaction mixture without preincubation. The complex cannot be exposed to pH values of 4 or below, or pH 9 or above. The stability studies have led to the development of conditions that permit one, for the first time, to subject the complex to electrophoresis and to recover a large percentage of both enzyme activities, rather than only decarboxylase activity as has occurred in the past. The electrophoretic studies indicate that PP-Rib-P produces a complex whose conformation and/or net charge differ significantly from that of the complex in the absence of PP-Rib-P. Kinetic characteristics of the transferase are a pH optimum between 6.5 and 7.5, apparent Km values for orotate, PP-Rib-P, and Mg2+ of 1.9 muM, 16 muM, and 2.9 mM, respectively; for the decarboxylase, a sharp pH optimum of 7.0 is observed, and a Km value for orotidine 5'-phosphate of 0.8 muM.",

In this paper, we describe the further purification of the endogenous factor from rat liver cytosol by anion-exchange HPLC (Ion-110) after prepurification by molecular sieving, cation absorption, and charcoal absorption. Elution of the factor with an isocratic gradient of ammonium bicarbonate results in recovery of all of the bioactivity in a single peak which coelutes with inorganic phosphate and contains all of the endogenous molybdenum. The bioactivity can be separated from inorganic phosphate by chromatography of the partially purified endogenous factor on a metal-chelating column of Chelex-100. The chelating procedure results in complete loss of bioactivity with recovery of 98% of the inorganic phosphate in both the column drop-through and a subsequent 1 M NaCl wash. The factor preparation purified through the Ion-110 HPLC step inhibits temperature-mediated dissociation of the immunopurified glucocorticoid receptor-hsp90 complex, but it is considerably more effective at stabilizing the unpurified receptor-hsp90 complex in a Chelex-treated cytosol system that has been depleted of metal components. These observations support the proposal that an endogenous metal can stabilize the binding of hsp90 to the receptor but it is likely that other cytosolic components that are not present in the immunopurified complex must contribute to the stability of the soluble protein-protein complex in cytosol.",

        "content": "Gallium-68 (68Ga) is a positron-emitting isotope with a half-life of 68 minutes. It can be generated from germanium-68 or zinc-68. It can be used for the inherent properties in the radiometal itself or the chelated agent's chemical properties (most commonly a somatostatin analog). It is often attached to a specific chelating agent to be used as a tracer (eg, DOTA-octreotate, also known as DOTATATE). The agent keeps gallium stably bound and free to distribute while binding to a specific receptor molecule. DOTATATE, DOTATOC, and DOTANOC are also referred to as GaTate, GaToc, and GaNoc, respectively. Bifunctional chelating binds the metal (68Ga3+ ion) to a complex. The complex should have a high affinity with gallium for in vivo\u00a0stability. In contrast, the targeting biomolecule (ex., drug, peptide, or antibody) in the complex can bind to a specific site and concentrate there. Essentially, gallium is paired with a compound that binds to a target tissue site. The complex is injected intravenously and is imaged with a PET detector at specific times depending on the desired target site uptake, but usually after\u00a01 hour.\u00a0In the case of GaTate, affinity is highest to the somatostatin receptor (SSTR) subtype 2. This leads to intense uptake in the spleen, adrenal glands, kidneys (not due to SSTR), and pituitary, with moderate intensity in the liver (not due to SSTR), thyroid, and saliva glands. There is also uptake in other areas, such as the pancreas, bone, brain, and lymph nodes. [4] GaToc has a high affinity to SSTR subtype 5, and GaNoc has a high affinity to SSTR subtypes 3 and 5. A homogenous uptake is physiologic, while intense heterogeneous, irregular focal uptake is worrying. The PET scan is usually done with a whole-body computed tomography (CT) scan for detailed anatomical mapping, referred to as a PET/CT scan.",
        "contents": "Gallium Scan -- Introduction. Gallium-68 (68Ga) is a positron-emitting isotope with a half-life of 68 minutes. It can be generated from germanium-68 or zinc-68. It can be used for the inherent properties in the radiometal itself or the chelated agent's chemical properties (most commonly a somatostatin analog). It is often attached to a specific chelating agent to be used as a tracer (eg, DOTA-octreotate, also known as DOTATATE). The agent keeps gallium stably bound and free to distribute while binding to a specific receptor molecule. DOTATATE, DOTATOC, and DOTANOC are also referred to as GaTate, GaToc, and GaNoc, respectively. Bifunctional chelating binds the metal (68Ga3+ ion) to a complex. The complex should have a high affinity with gallium for in vivo\u00a0stability. In contrast, the targeting biomolecule (ex., drug, peptide, or antibody) in the complex can bind to a specific site and concentrate there.
