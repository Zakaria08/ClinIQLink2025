Serum cholesterol was found to be normal. The mean serum urea level was significantly elevated, as were creatine phosphokinase and lactic dehydrogenase. Most patients exhibited a neutrophil leukocytosis  and an elevated sedimentation rate, and the mean hemoglobin level was low. Liver histology was studied in 13 patients. There was evidence of mild bile stasis in 5 and moderate bile stasis in 2. Findings were otherwise nonspecific and were characterized by fatty change and/or inflammatory cells in the portal areas. There was no correlation between degree or duration of juandice and prognosis, although all patients who died remained jaundiced until death. It is suggested that this syndrome is not one of true cholestasis in that all biliary substances were not shown to be elevated in the serum, but that it is rather a selective defect in the excretion of conjugated bilirubin.",
        "contents": "Jaundice in severe bacterial infection. Thirty patients are described who developed jaundice during the course of severe bacterial infection. Although the infecting organism was variable, as was the site of infection, the patients were generally ill and pyrexial. The group had a very high mortality rate (43%). A positive blood culture was obtained in 11 patients. Biochemical abnormalities noted were those of an increased concentration of conjugated bilirubin in the serum with only a modest increase in alkaline phosphatase and transaminase levels. Serum cholesterol was found to be normal. The mean serum urea level was significantly elevated, as were creatine phosphokinase and lactic dehydrogenase. Most patients exhibited a neutrophil leukocytosis  and an elevated sedimentation rate, and the mean hemoglobin level was low. Liver histology was studied in 13 patients.

        "content": "The diagnosis of early or mild chronic pancreatitis can be challenging because there is no biomarker for the disease. In contrast to acute pancreatitis, the serum amylase and lipase levels are usually not strikingly elevated in chronic pancreatitis. Elevation of serum bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase may indicate cholestasis secondary to common bile duct stricture caused by chronic inflammation. Many patients have impaired glucose tolerance with elevated fasting blood glucose levels. The fecal elastase-1 and small-bowel biopsy are useful in the evaluation of patients with suspected pancreatic steatorrhea. The fecal elastase level will be abnormal and small-bowel histology will be normal in such patients. A decrease of fecal elastase level to <100 \u03bcg per gram of stool strongly suggests severe pancreatic exocrine insufficiency.",

        "content": "In people with alcoholic hepatitis, the serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ratio is greater than 2:1. AST and ALT levels are almost always less than 500. The elevated AST to ALT ratio is due to deficiency of pyridoxal phosphate, which is required in the ALT enzyme synthetic pathway. Furthermore, alcohol metabolite\u2013induced injury of hepatic mitochondria results in AST isoenzyme release. Other laboratory findings include red blood cell macrocytosis (mean corpuscular volume > 100) and elevations of serum gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin levels. Folate level is reduced in alcoholic patients due to decreased intestinal absorption, increased bone marrow requirement for folate in the presence of alcohol, and increased urinary loss. The magnitude of leukocytosis (white blood cell depletion) reflects severity of liver injury. Histologic features include Mallory bodies, giant mitochondria, hepatocyte necrosis, and",
