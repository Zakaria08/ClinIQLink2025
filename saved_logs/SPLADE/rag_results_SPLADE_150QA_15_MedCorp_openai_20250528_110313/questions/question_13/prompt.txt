Document 1 (Title: GLUT1 deficiency): The syndrome can cause infantile seizures refractory to anticonvulsive drugs, developmental delay, acquired microcephaly and neurologic manifestations including spasticity, hypotonia, and ataxia. The frequency, severity, and types of seizures may vary considerably among GLUT1 deficiency patients and do not necessarily correspond to the severity of other symptoms. Most seizures in GLUT1 deficiency patients are not easily treated with anti-seizure medications. A minority of GLUT1 deficiency patients (approximately 10%) do not experience seizures. Cognitive symptoms often become apparent as developmental milestones are delayed. Cognitive deficits range from subtle learning difficulties to severe intellectual disabilities. Often speech and language are impaired. Behavioral symptoms affect relations with other people and may include short attention span, intractability, and delays in achieving age-appropriate behaviors. Sociability with peers, however, is a strength in GLUT1 deficiency
Document 2 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): Introduction to Toxicology: Occupational & Environmental Daniel T. Teitelbaum, MD* A 6-year-old girl is brought to the emergency department by her parents. She is comatose, tachypneic (25 breaths per minute), and tachycardic (150 bpm), but she appears flushed, and fingertip pulse oximetry is normal (97%) breathing room air. Questioning of her parents reveals that they are homeless and have been living in their car (a small van). The nights have been cold, and they have used a small char-coal burner to keep warm inside the vehicle. What is the most likely diagnosis? What treatment should be instituted immediately? If her mother is pregnant, what additional measures should be taken?
Document 3 (Title: Lisch Nodules -- Evaluation): LNs have been reported in patients with segmental neurofibromatosis, which is due to a somatic mutation of the neurofibromin gene. [19] A case has been reported describing the presence of LN in a 47-year-old male with NF2 where the patient had bilateral sensorineural deafness and progressive ataxia. MRI revealed the appearance of bilateral acoustic neuromas. Multiple LNs were present in his right eye. [5] A single case report described the presence of unilateral LN with cafe-au-lait macules on the same side of the body. [21] LNs are also reported in patients with Watson syndrome characterized by cafe-au-lait macules, pulmonary valvular stenosis, and mental retardation. [9] A case report described a 43-year-old male with NF1 whose one of the sisters had multiple LNs, while her elder daughter had only one LN. Neither of these 2 patients had any signs of cutaneous or systemic neurofibromatosis. Therefore, LNs are the ocular marker of NF1 in otherwise normal family members of patients with NF1. [9] A case report described a 21-year-old healthy White woman diagnosed to have multiple, unilateral LNs in the absence of additional features of NF1. [22] She, however, had a solitary 5 mm hypopigmented macule on her back under Wood's light illumination. [22]
Document 4 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): A 21-year-old woman comes with her parents to discuss therapeutic options for her Crohn’s disease. She was diag-nosed with Crohn’s disease 2 years ago, and it involves her terminal ileum and proximal colon, as confirmed by colonoscopy and small bowel radiography. She was initially treated with mesalamine and budesonide with good response, but over the last 2 months, she has had a relapse of her symptoms. She is experiencing fatigue, cramping, abdominal pains, and nonbloody diarrhea up to 10 times daily, and she has had a 15-lb weight loss. She has no other significant medical or surgical his-tory. Her current medications are mesalamine 2.4 g/d and budesonide 9 mg/d. She appears thin and tired. Abdominal examination reveals tenderness without guarding in the right lower quadrant; no masses are palpable. On perianal examination, there is no tenderness, fissure, or fistula. Her laboratory data are notable for anemia and elevated C-reactive protein. What are the options for immediate
Document 5 (Title: Emergence and resolution of ambivalence in expectant mothers.): Little has been written about the perceptions of expectant mothers with previous histories of psychiatric disturbance and their affective oscillations during pregnancy. This paper discusses the case of a 22-year-old primigravida with a history of schizoaffective disorder who was referred to our mother-infant psychotherapy service. Despite the patient's initial defensive style, she was asked to discuss several dreams that she had had since learning about her pregnancy. A wealth of information about the patient's unconscious ambivalence and destructive wishes toward her unborn infant emerged. The patient was also unable to engage in any predictive imagery about the future of her infant or to anticipate intuitively what the experience of mothering would be like. This paper reveals that pregnant women with a history of psychological disturbances often have highly aberrational fantasies and ambivalent impulses toward their unborn infant, and some of these fantasies threaten to manifest in the form of abusive behavior after the birth. Techniques for predicting how new mothers with previous psychiatric histories will interact with their infants after birth are outlined. It is hoped that this treatment may avert child abuse.
Document 6 (Title: Febrile seizure): (a parent or sibling), have a short time between the onset of fever and the seizure, had a low degree of fever before their seizure, or have a history of abnormal neurological signs or developmental delay. Children with a first prolonged febrile seizure are not at increased risk of a recurrent febrile seizure; however, if there is a recurrence, it is also likely to be prolonged. Similarly, the overall prognosis after a complex febrile seizure is usually excellent. About 10-15% will eventually develop epilepsy but 85-90% will not. A single, very large study from Denmark suggested that, compared with the normal population, children with complex febrile seizures had a slightly increased risk of death in the two years after their first febrile seizure. This increase appeared mostly to be related to the development of epilepsy or low birth weight, neonatal asphxyia and congenital malformations. Once two years had passed since their first febrile seizure, children with complex febrile
Document 7 (Title: Pennsylvania Child Abuse Recognition and Reporting -- Pearls and Other Issues -- A 13-year-old girl is brought to her pediatrician because of a recent decline in her grades. During a private interview, she admits she has "problems with boys at school" and "bad dreams about boys always staring at her." The child privately admits she regularly gets up in the middle of the night and sleeps with the biological mother on her side of the bed, with her stepfather next to her mother. The child indicates the stepfather has commented that she is a "looker," has "big headlights," and needs to "fend off the boys at school." The pediatrician attended high school with the stepfather and knows he is not the "brightest bulb" but seems to care about the child genuinely. The child indicates the stepfather wears pajamas, has never touched her, and always knocks before entering the bathroom or her room. She says she is very anxious about attending school and is afraid to speak with her mother about her school problems. She says her stepfather has always been "very good" to her mother and is always kind and considerate to her as well. She does not want to get him into trouble but feels his comments about her appearance add to her anxiety. What should the pediatrician do in this situation?): Given the totality of the circumstances, there may not be reasonable cause to suspect child abuse; however, there remain numerous concerns, such as the child's problems at school, nightmares, child co-sleeping at the age of 13, and the stepfather's inappropriate comments to the child. General concerns for a child's safety, health, and well-being may be reported to ChildLine for assessment of services and support. The PA CPSL prescribes that a person, hospital, institution, school, facility, agency, or agency employee acting in good faith shall have immunity from civil and criminal liability that might otherwise result from making a report of suspected child abuse or making a referral for general protective services, regardless of whether the report is required to be made under the PA CPSL.
Document 8 (Title: Granuloma Inguinale -- Epidemiology): Govender et al reported 2 cases where young children were diagnosed with donovanosis with no history of sexual exposure. An 8-month-old female presented with a right ear mass and discharge. She was initially treated with antibiotics and surgical resection but did not follow up for 8 months. When she presented again, she was found to have progressed in symptomatology and had a new right temporal lobe abscess. She required a craniectomy to drain the abscess, as well as a mastoidectomy. Tissue was removed during the surgery for analysis, and the diagnosis of granuloma inguinale was made. Questioning of the parents revealed no signs or symptoms of sexual abuse. No gynecological exam was performed on the patient’s mother, so it is unknown if she had a genital ulcer. The patient was treated with erythromycin with noted improvement in the right temporal lobe lesion noted on computed tomography before discharge. The patient and her family were unavailable for follow-up after discharge. [2]
Document 9 (Title: Paroxysmal electroencephalographic abnormalities genetically transmitted: one family description.): A 10-year-old girl came to our observation since a general rule-out electroencephalogram (EEG) had showed, in absence of any clinical manifestation, generalized and symmetrical 3 c/s spike-and-wave bursts, whose duration was longer than 3 s. The subject, only daughter born from her mother's first marriage, had no family history of neurological diseases; her physical and neuropsychological examinations were normal. A polysomnographic recording showed, during sleep, the same abnormalities observed during wakefulness. Also on this occasion, there were no related clinical manifestations. Subsequent recordings were performed on her 33-year-old mother and on two siblings, 3 and 2 years old, respectively, born from their mother's second marriage, all normal by physical and neuropsychological examinations, with no referral about clinical seizures. Among them, the 3-year-old sister showed asymptomatic left rolandic spikes, while the 2-year-old boy, whose EEG was firstly normal, displayed, 1 year later, a burst of generalized 3 c/s spike-and-wave paroxysmal activity on a 4-7 c/s background activity. The possible unitary genetic transmission of paroxysmal EEG abnormalities is discussed.
Document 10 (Title: Anticonvulsant syndrome with multiple symptoms, including porphyria, IgA deficiency, and liver dysfunction.): A 19-year-old Japanese female who had been treated for epilepsy with a combined phenytoin-phenobarbital preparation for the past three years presented with increasing skin pigmentation and hirsutism. She had suffered two attacks of loss of consciousness after bilateral partial oophorectomy at the age of 16. Investigations revealed a marked increase in coproporphyrin levels in the urine and feces, a marked decrease in her serum IgA level, and liver dysfunction. All these manifestations gradually improved upon the withdrawal of her antiepileptic treatment. In vitro studies revealed B cell dysfunction producing IgA deficiency, which normalized within one year after discontinuation of the antiepileptic therapy. It was assumed that her treatment had worsened preexisting porphyria, which was misdiagnosed as epilepsy because of abnormal EEG findings. The type of porphyria appeared to be hereditary coproporphyria, despite the lack of a family history.
Document 11 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): Roger J. Porter, MD, & Michael A. Rogawski, MD, PhD was unchanged, and levetiracetam was gradually increased to 1000 mg bid. The patient had no significant adverse effects from this dosage. At age 21, she had a second tonic-clonic seizure while in college; further discussion with her room-mate at that time revealed a history of two recent episodes of 1–2 minutes of altered consciousness with lip smacking (focal impaired awareness seizure, formerly complex partial seizure). A repeat EEG showed occasional right temporal spikes. What is one possible strategy for controlling her present symptoms? A 23-year-old woman presents to the office for consultation regarding her antiseizure medications. Seven years ago, this otherwise healthy young woman had a tonic-clonic seizure at home. She was rushed to the emergency department, at which time she was alert but complained of headache. A consulting neurologist placed her on levetiracetam, 500 mg bid. Four days later, electroencephalography (EEG)
Document 12 (Title: [Congenital hemihypertrophy associated with cutaneous pigmento-vascular, cerebral, visceral and bone abnormalities].): A case of hemihypertrophy associated with multiple anomalies of the skin, bone and visceral organs is presented. A 31-year-old female was admitted for evaluation of her skin conditions. Her family history is noncontributory, while her past history discloses operations for syndactyly of the right foot, tonsillar hypertrophy, anal prolapse and ovarial cyst. Erythemas of the face and the left upper extremity were noticed during the neonatal period and hypertrophy of the right side of the body started at age 2 months. On admission, hemihypertrophy was observed in the face, trunk and extremities. Multiple faint nevi flammei were seen on the right half of the face and on the left side of the trunk and extremities. Telangiectasis and nevus anemicus were seen in the upper chest. The left upper extremity showed diffuse brown patches that was histologically basal pigmentation with some giant melanosomes. Visceral anomalies consisted of fibromatous tumors of the tip of the tongue and mitral prolapse. Angiography and computed tomography revealed a possible arteriovenous malformation of the right occipital region, small hemangiomas around the patella, dilation of the lateral ventricle, and calcification of the choroid plexus. Tortuous superficial veins were noted in the right leg. She had no seizure, but her IQ was 68. The bone disorders consisted of scoliosis, short forth metacarpus, hypoplastic mandible and peroneal exostosis. Examination revealed a slight diminution of urinary corticosteroid, but no other endocrinological disorders were found. The hemihypertrophy in this case is at least partially due to an arteriovenous shunt, suggested by elevated oxygen saturation of the blood obtained from the internal saphenous vein.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Document 13 (Title: Pleiotropy): A common example of pleiotropy is the human disease phenylketonuria (PKU). This disease causes mental retardation and reduced hair and skin pigmentation, and can be caused by any of a large number of mutations in the single gene on chromosome 12 that codes for the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase, which converts the amino acid phenylalanine to tyrosine. Depending on the mutation involved, this conversion is reduced or ceases entirely. Unconverted phenylalanine builds up in the bloodstream and can lead to levels that are toxic to the developing nervous system of newborn and infant children. The most dangerous form of this is called classic PKU, which is common in infants. The baby seems normal at first but actually incurs permanent intellectual disability. This can cause symptoms such as mental retardation, abnormal gait and posture, and delayed growth. Because tyrosine is used by the body to make melanin (a component of the pigment found in the hair and skin), failure to convert
Document 14 (Title: Identifying and Addressing Bullying -- History and Physical): Another example is a teen immigrant girl with weight loss whose mother is concerned she does not like American school lunches. However, a thorough history and physical examination reveal she has been feeling isolated, and she reports that kids tease her incessantly about her lack of English language skills. No one will sit with her at lunchtime, so she avoids the cafeteria. She admits to mood swings, and the physical examination is notable for self-inflicted cutting scars on her forearms. The clinician must elicit further information to determine if she is at risk of suicidal ideation or behavior before developing a management plan and arranging follow-up.
Document 15 (Title: Behavioral diagnostics.): The contemporary behavior analyst, to operate ethically and effectively, must be aware of many more factors affecting behavior than simple consequences. Although the literature demonstrating the effectiveness of active behavior management is impressive, a compelling argument can be made that a great number of behavior problem seen in individuals with developmental disabilities may be attributable to factors other than consequences. Our experience has been more often than not that physiological, organic, medication, or situational variables are the actual culprits in maladaptive behavior. Individuals with severe or profound retardation may respond to aversive features of their environment by displaying noncompliance, tantrums, aggression, or self-injurious behavior. These antecedents can affect their behavior just as powerfully as can the consequences of their behavior. Behavior analysts must become sensitive to these potential factors and be prepared to employ behavioral diagnostic strategies in the search for the causes of maladaptive behavior. Finally, they must be prepared to design rather unconventional passive behavior management treatment programs involving the manipulation of the antecedent environment. In the case of Carrie, from the example at the beginning of this paper, the analysis yielded the hypothesis that her face scratching was a reaction to sinus blockage caused by seasonal allergies. Her treatment involved daily dosages of antihistamines administered by our nurses and subsequent elimination of the scratching. Tom was found to be suffering from "wheelchair fatigue." When he was allowed to recline on other surfaces (e.g., bean bag chair, mat, bolster) on a regular basis, he did not attempt any form of self-injury. Melissa was found to have a severe case of Pre Menstrual Syndrome as well as seizure disorder, and was treated with the appropriate medications. Her headbanging was reduced to a few minor incidents per month. Walter's tantrums on closer inspection seemed part of a chain of behavior leading to seizure-like attacks. Preliminary evidence suggests that when he is treated with phenobarbital the tantrums and aggression disappear. And finally, Debbie was found to be very sensitive to a variety of discomforting events. She would cry, sob, and scream when she was wet, thirsty, hungry, and tired. Changing her regularly, offering her water every hour and extra snacks in the morning as well as short naps in the early afternoon eliminated the crying and sobbing. She now participates with the other clients and seems to enjoy the house activities.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
Question: A 9-month-old female is brought to the emergency department after experiencing a seizure. She was born at home and was normal at birth according to her parents. Since then, they have noticed that she does not appear to be achieving developmental milestones as quickly as her siblings, and often appears lethargic. Physical exam reveals microcephaly, very light pigmentation (as compared to her family), and a "musty" body odor. The varied manifestations of this disease can most likely be attributed to which of the following genetic principles?
Options:
A. Anticipation
B. Multiple gene mutations
C. Pleiotropy
D. Variable expressivity
