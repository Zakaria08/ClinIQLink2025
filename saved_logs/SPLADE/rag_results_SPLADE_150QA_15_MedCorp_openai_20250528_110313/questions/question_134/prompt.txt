Document 1 (Title: A special, supplemented 'vegan' diet for nephrotic patients.): High dietary protein intake, in the past recommended for nephrotic syndrome, does not improve hypoproteinemia and may accelerate progressive renal damage. In contrast, low-protein diets reduce proteinuria and preserve renal function in experimental renal models of nephrotic syndrome. In this study, 20 steroid-resistant, nephrotic patients were treated with a pure vegetarian, low-protein diet, supplemented with essential amino acids and ketoanalogues (supplemented vegan diet, SVD) for 4.6 +/- 3.1 months. Before the study, these patients followed an unrestricted protein, low-sodium diet (LSD). Proteinuria, daily urea nitrogen excretion and creatinine clearance decreased significantly on SVD. A similar lowering effect of SVD was observed on serum total cholesterol. Seven of the 20 patients changed from LSD to SVD and vice-versa on 3 occasions, and in all cases, we found an increase of proteinuria during the LSD period. Serum albumin, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides and anthropometric measurements did not change on SVD. Our data suggest that SVD exerts a favorable effect on proteinuria and hypercholesterolemia in nephrotic patients, without inducing clinical or laboratory signs of malnutrition.
Document 2 (Title: Hypoalbuminemia -- Evaluation): Decreased albumin levels may be an incidental finding on protein electrophoresis; however, protein electrophoresis provides a semi-quantitative albumin value. The main value of protein electrophoresis in a patient with low serum albumin is with the differential diagnosis of hypoalbuminemia. In the presence of acute inflammation, hypoalbuminemia will be present with an increase in alpha-1 and 2 globulins and normal gamma globulins. In chronic inflammation, the protein electrophoresis pattern will show hypoalbuminemia with a polyclonal increase in gamma globulins.
Document 3 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): acidosis. An increase in the AG is most often due to an increase in unmeasured anions and, less commonly, is due to a decrease in unmeasured cations (calcium, magnesium, potassium). In addition, the AG may increase with an increase in anionic albumin, because of either increased albumin concentration or alkalosis, which alters albumin charge. A decrease in the AG can be due to (1) an increase in unmeasured cations; (2) the addition to the blood of abnormal cations, such as lithium (lithium intoxication) or cationic immunoglobulins (plasma cell dyscrasias); (3) a reduction in the major plasma anion albumin concentration (nephrotic syndrome); (4) a decrease in the effective anionic charge on albumin by acidosis; or (5) hyperviscosity and severe hyperlipidemia, which can lead to an underestimation of sodium and chloride concentrations. A fall in serum albumin by 1 g/dL from the normal value (4.5 g/dL) decreases the AG by 2.5 meq/L. Know the common causes of a high-AG acidosis (Table
Document 4 (Title: Pediatrics_Nelson): Nephrotic syndrome (NS) is characterized by persistent heavy proteinuria (mainly albuminuria) (>2 g/m2/24 h);hypoproteinemia (serum albumin <3.0 g/dL); hypercholesterolemia (>250 mg/dL); and edema. Age, race, and geography affect the incidence of NS. Certain HLA types (HLA-DR7, HLA-B8, and HLA-B12) are associated with an increased incidence of NS. Increased glomerular permeability is due to alterations in the normal glomerular cellular and basement membrane barrier that restrict filtration of serum proteins. The resultant massive proteinuria leads to decreased serum proteins, especially albumin. Plasma oncotic pressure is diminished, leading to fluid shifts from vascular to interstitial compartments and plasma volume contraction. Renal syndrome Primary focal Henoch-Schönlein purpura, glomerulosclerosis Wegener and other vasculitides Membranoproliferative Chronic infections (hepatitis B, glomerulonephritis hepatitis C, malaria, human
Document 5 (Title: Minimal change disease): Minimal change disease (also known as MCD, minimal change glomerulopathy, and nil disease, among others) is a disease affecting the kidneys which causes a nephrotic syndrome. Nephrotic syndrome leads to the loss of significant amounts of protein in the urine, which causes the widespread edema (soft tissue swelling) and impaired kidney function commonly experienced by those affected by the disease. It is most common in children and has a peak incidence at 2 to 6 years of age. MCD is responsible for 10-25% of nephrotic syndrome cases in adults. It is also the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome of unclear cause (idiopathic) in children. Signs and symptoms The clinical signs of minimal change disease are proteinuria (abnormal excretion of proteins, mainly albumin, into the urine), edema (swelling of soft tissues as a consequence of water retention), weight gain, and hypoalbuminaemia (low serum albumin). These signs are referred to collectively as nephrotic syndrome.
Document 6 (Title: Hypoalbuminemia -- Evaluation): In the presence of nephrotic syndrome, hypoalbuminemia with an increase in alpha-2 globulins, due to increased macroglobulin, and low gamma globulins are the typical pattern on serum protein electrophoresis. With chronic liver disease, hypoalbuminemia with increase gamma globulins and beta-gamma bridging is typical.
Document 7 (Title: Serum thyroxine and thyroxine-binding proteins in chronic renal failure without nephrosis.): Total serum thyroxine (T4), free thyroxine index (FTI), thyroxine binding globulin (TBG) binding capacity, serum albumin, alpha-globulins and urinary protein excretion were measured in 50 patients with chronic renal failure, but without nephrotic syndrome. 25 patients were undergoing chronic hemodialysis. T4 was within the normal range in most patients. There was a tendency to lower T4 values as compared to an age and sex-matched control group, but this did not reach statistical significance. TBG was normal in most patients. 4 patients showed elevated TBG concomitant with elevation of other alpha-globulins. Serum albumin was significantly decreased. No correlation existed between daily protein excretion and TBG or alpha-globulins, but the correlation between serum albumin and proteinuria was highly significant. T4 and proteinuria correlated with borderline significance. A highly significant correlation between T4 and TBG-albumin values was found. No correlation existed between FTI and TBG-albumin levels. The data suggest that T4 and TBG are normal in most patients with renal failure, even in the presence of significant proteinuria. Low T4 values, when found in renal insufficiency, may be secondary to low serum albumin and possibly prealbumin.
Document 8 (Title: Serum protein electrophoresis): Haptoglobin/haemaglobin complexes migrate more cathodally than haptoglobin as seen in the alpha-2 – beta interzone. This is typically seen as a broadening of the alpha-2 zone. Alpha-2 macroglobulin may be elevated in children and the elderly. This is seen as a sharp front to the alpha-2 band. AMG is markedly raised (10-fold increase or greater) in association with glomerular protein loss, as in nephrotic syndrome. Due to its large size, AMG cannot pass through glomeruli, while other lower-molecular weight proteins are lost. Enhanced synthesis of AMG accounts for its absolute increase in nephrotic syndrome. Increased AMG is also noted in rats with no albumin indicating that this is a response to low albumin rather than nephrotic syndrome itself AMG is mildly elevated early in the course of diabetic nephropathy.
Document 9 (Title: Serum protein electrophoresis): Albumin – alpha-1 interzone Even staining in this zone is due to alpha-1 lipoprotein (high density lipoprotein – HDL). Decrease occurs in severe inflammation, acute hepatitis, and cirrhosis. Also, nephrotic syndrome can lead to decrease in albumin level; due to its loss in the urine through a damaged leaky glomerulus. An increase appears in severe alcoholics and in women during pregnancy and in puberty. The high levels of AFP that may occur in hepatocellular carcinoma may result in a sharp band between the albumin and the alpha-1 zone.
Document 10 (Title: Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors for reduction of proteinuria in children with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome.): The effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) on proteinuria, renal function, and serum proteins were evaluated in six children with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome and proteinuria of 3-15 g/24 h (277 +/- 47 mg/m2 per hour). Following ACEI, proteinuria decreased from 7,408 +/- 2,385 (mean +/- SEM) to 3,746 +/- 1,395 mg/24 h (P less than 0.05). Creatinine clearance was 87.8 +/- 22.6 before and 96.4 +/- 23.6 ml/min per 1.73 m2 after ACEI. In two patients, inulin and para-aminohippuric acid clearances were normal before and after ACEI, together with parallel reductions of urine protein of 50% and 46%. Clearance of total protein was reduced by 56% following ACEI, compared with reduction in the clearance of gamma globulin by 58% and albumin by 39.5%. No significant change was seen in blood pressure, serum albumin, or total protein following ACEI. After ACEI, diuretic doses were able to be reduced or eliminated in three patients. Reduction of proteinuria was sustained during a followup period of 11-20 months in three patients. ACEI may be of benefit in the clinical management of children with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndromes, allowing reduction in diuretic requirements.
Document 11 (Title: Fructosamine -- Interfering Factors): Fructosamine assays are affected by changes in temperature and by the increased presence of reducing substances in serum, for example, vitamin C and bilirubin. Fructosamine and GA both do not have standardized assays. Additionally, both fructosamine and glycated albumin are affected by the presence of any conditions that influence serum albumin concentrations. However, this is minimized for GA since this is expressed as a percentage of total albumin. Fructosamine will be unreliable when serum albumin is less than 3.0 g/dl. This will include conditions where there is decreased albumin synthesis, like in liver cirrhosis, or when there is albumin/protein loss such as in nephrotic syndrome and protein-losing enteropathies. Fructosamine levels may also be affected by conditions with raised total protein levels, like in multiple myeloma (due to increased immunoglobulins) and in polyclonal gammopathies.
Document 12 (Title: Globulin): The globulins are a family of globular proteins that have higher molecular weights than albumins and are insoluble in pure water but dissolve in dilute salt solutions. Some globulins are produced in the liver, while others are made by the immune system. Globulins, albumins, and fibrinogen are the major blood proteins. The normal concentration of globulins in human blood is about 2.6-3.5 g/dL. The term "globulin" is sometimes used synonymously with "globular protein". However, albumins are also globular proteins, but are not globulins. All other serum globular proteins are globulins. Types of globulins All globulins fall into one of the following four categories : Alpha 1 globulins Alpha 2 globulins Beta globulins Gamma globulins (one group of gamma globulins is the immunoglobulins, which are also known as "antibodies") Globulins can be distinguished from one another using serum protein electrophoresis.
Document 13 (Title: Pathology_Robbins): The nephrotic syndrome has diverse causes that share a common pathophysiology, a derangement in the capillary walls of the glomeruli that results in increased permeability to plasma proteins. Increased permeability of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) may result from structural or physicochemical alterations in the GBM. With long-standing or heavy proteinuria, serum albumin is decreased, giving rise to hypoalbuminemia and a drop in plasma colloid osmotic pressure, which in turn leads to leakage of fluid from the blood into extravascular spaces. As discussed in Chapter 4, the resulting decrease in intravascular volume and renal blood flow triggers increased release of renin from renal juxtaglomerular cells. Renin in turn stimulates the angiotensin-aldosterone axis, which promotes the retention of salt and water by the kidney. This tendency is exacerbated by reductions in the cardiac secretion of natriuretic factors attributed to decreased intravascular volume. In the face of
Document 14 (Title: Nephritic syndrome): Signs and symptoms Historically, nephritic syndrome has been characterized by blood in the urine (hematuria), high blood pressure (hypertension), decreased urine output <400 ml/day (oliguria), red blood cell casts, pyuria, and mild to moderate proteinuria. If the condition is allowed to progress without treatment, it can eventually lead to azotemia and uremic symptoms. This constellation of symptoms contrasts with the classical presentation of nephrotic syndrome (excessive proteinuria >3.5 g/day, low plasma albumin levels (hypoalbuminemia) <3 g/L, generalized edema, and hyperlipidemia).
Document 15 (Title: Urinalysis -- Results, Reporting, and Critical Findings -- Proteins): Proteinuria is another critical finding. In normal conditions, the glomerular capillary wall is permeable to molecules of less than 20,000 Daltons. Most of the small fraction of filtered proteins are reabsorbed and metabolized by the proximal tubule cells. Thus, proteins are normally present in urine in trace amounts. From the total urinary proteins, approximately one-third of the total is albumin, another third is a protein secreted by the tubular cells called Tamm–Horsfall glycoprotein, and the rest is made up of plasma proteins such as globulins. Proteinuria can be classified into a transient or persistent, with the first one typically been a benign condition (i.e., orthostatic proteinuria due to prolonged standing). For the latter, persistent proteinuria can my categorized as a glomerular pattern, a tubular pattern, and an overflow pattern. The first occurs when proteins that are not normally filtered (i.e., albumin, transferrin) pass by a damaged glomerular capillary wall. Thus, this pattern may be seen with low serum albumin, secondary generalized edema, and high serum lipids as in nephrotic syndrome. Usually, protein excretion is greater than 3.0 g/day to 3.5 g/day. The tubular pattern results from the tubular cells' inability to reabsorb filtered proteins. Consequently, small serum proteins are typically seen in the microscopic examination, and proteinuria is not relatively high (approximately 1 g/day to 2 g/day). Finally, overflow proteinuria occurs when excessive concentrations of small proteins in plasma are filtered, and tubular cells reabsorption's capacity is surpassed, which occurs in conditions such as rhabdomyolysis (myoglobin) and multiple myeloma (Bence Jones light chains). This phenomenon harms tubular cells, and they may be seen on microscopic examination.  Qualitative assessment of minimal amounts of proteinuria serves as a marker for glomerular injury and risk of progression of renal disease. Normal albumin excretion is less than or equal to 29 mg/g creatinine. It is best to express albuminuria per gram of creatinine. According to the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines, albuminuria can be classified into three stages: A1 (less than 30 mg/g creatinine; normal to mildly increased), A2 (30 mg/g to 300 mg/g creatinine; moderately increased, formerly termed as "microalbuminuria"), and A3 (greater than 300 mg/g creatinine; severely increased).
