Document 1 (Title: Point of service plan): A point of service plan is a type of managed care health insurance plan in the United States. It combines characteristics of the health maintenance organization (HMO) and the preferred provider organization (PPO). The POS is based on a managed care foundation—lower medical costs in exchange for more limited choice. But POS health insurance does differ from other managed care plans. Enrollees in a POS plan are required to choose a primary care physician (PCP) from within the health care network; this PCP becomes their "point of service". The PCP may make referrals outside the network, but with lesser compensation offered by the patient's health insurance company. For medical visits within the health care network, paperwork is usually completed for the patient. If the patient chooses to go outside the network, it is the patient's responsibility to fill out forms, send bills in for payment, and keep an accurate account of health care receipts. References
Document 2 (Title: Quality assurance and utilization review in a health insuring organization. The HealthPASS example.): HealthPASS is a Philadelphia-based health insurance organization (HIO), owned and operated by the Penn Health Corporation, a subsidiary of Maxicare, the large for-profit health maintenance organization (HMO) company based in California. In a contractual agreement with the Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare (DPW), Maxicare contracts primary care physician services on a capitated basis, and other services on a fee basis, to about 96,000 Medicaid enrollees in certain zip codes in Philadelphia. Although HealthPASS does not provide care directly, it contracts with providers for these medical services. HealthPASS serves a primarily poor, minority, and inner city population with high rates of drug abuse, alcoholism, and mental illness. Currently, the enrollees are served by a network of providers including more than 40 participating hospitals and over 500 primary care providers (PCPs) in the community. HealthPASS is unique as previous HIOs in Kentucky and Arizona both failed. This paper describes the quality assurance and utilization review (QA-UR) system implemented by HealthPASS with specific examples of case discussions and a detailed look at the structure and function of the internal review process. Before outlining the QA-UR system, a brief history is provided of the recent controversial trend toward managed care for Medicaid recipients, as there have been marked failures in this arena nationally. The HealthPASS system is described--what it is, how it is staffed, who it serves, and the health services it offers.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Document 3 (Title: Managed Care -- Definition/Introduction): Over time, some less traditional HMOs emerged where the PCP does not serve as the gatekeeper, and the patient may self-referral to a specialist. However, for the service to be covered and paid for by the managed care plan, the patient is still limited to only receiving care and service from network providers. HMOs' utilization and quality management programs collect much data on the care and services authorized and provided by the PCP and other providers. This data is communicated to the PCP and other network providers regularly as the financial incentives revolve around compliance with the managed care plan’s utilization and quality programs’ targets. For the patients, the financial incentive is that they receive insurance coverage only for services that occur within the network.
Document 4 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Medicaid is a state–federal partnership whose greatest single expenditure is nursing home care. Thus, the need for chronic daily assistance with personal care in a nursing home consumes a large part of most state Medicaid budgets as well as personal assets. Accordingly, alternatives to chronic nursing-home care are of great interest to states, patients, and families. Some states have developed Medicaid-funded day-care programs, sometimes based on the Program for All-Inclusive Day programs Medical, surgical, and psychiatric services that cannot be provided in less complex settings Resuscitation, stabilization, triage, disposition Hospital-based residential program providing team-based, physician-supervised, intensive therapeutic rehabilitation for specific diagnoses Chronic, urgent, and preventive services Medical, nursing, and rehabilitative services after hospitalization, often based in hospitals or nursing homes
Document 5 (Title: Managed Care -- Definition/Introduction): The types of managed care insurance or benefit management approaches have also evolved. Initially, managed care was synonymous with a health maintenance organization or HMO approach. [6] In the traditional HMO model, patients enrolled select a primary care provider (PCP) who receives a PMPM to provide care and coordinate all services for that patient. The PCP serves as the patient’s gatekeeper for all necessary services and must provide a referral for the patient to be seen by a subspecialist or to receive imaging or laboratory studies. The PCP is expected to manage and oversee the care so that only appropriate care and services are provided according to available evidence or consistent with standardized care pathways. Only network providers are available to the patient in an HMO, so specialists, hospitals, pharmacies, imaging centers, and laboratories are preselected, credentialed, and contracted by the HMO. In the case of an HMO with a gatekeeper model, coverage is only available for care and services authorized by their PCP.
Document 6 (Title: UnitedHealth Group): Products and services Health insurance plans UnitedHealthcare offers commercial group insurance plans across the United States under several product names with different offerings. UnitedHealthcare Select is an exclusive provider organization (EPO) with no coverage for out-of-network providers UnitedHealthcare Select Plus is a preferred provider organization (PPO). UnitedHealthcare Choice functions as a HMO plan with access to specialists, whereas UnitedHealthcare Choice Plus is an HMO which allows for out-of-network coverage. UnitedHealthcare Navigate, Charter, and Compass require a primary care physician referral to see a specialist meaning that they are more restrictive managed care plans, similar to point of service plans.
Document 7 (Title: When a solution is not a solution: Medicaid and Health Maintenance Organizations.): Health Maintenance Organization (HMOs) are repeatedly described as a general solution to the health care crisis and a specific solution to the problems confronting Medicare and Medicaid. The potential incorporation of HMOs into Medicaid has promised to improve the states' ability to accurately budget program expenditures, simplify management, eliminate abusive practices directly linked to fee-for-service (e.g., billing for undelivered services for providing unnecessary care) and, most important, contain costs. At the same time it has promised to increase access to mainstream medicine. Experience has shown, however, that the promise has often been severely compromised by unethical HMO marketing practices, inadequacy of services and excessive administrative costs. This article examines some of the reasons: the political process which created HMOs, the rhetorical claims which exaggerated the strengths of prepaid group practice and distorted the formulation of policy, and the peculiar characteristics of the Medicaid program which have caused Medicaid HMOs to deviate considerably from theoretical expectations.
Document 8 (Title: The Broward network for comprehensive care for AIDS: a public health response.): Florida with 6,599 cases of AIDS as of January 30, 1989, and Broward County with 1,048 cases is experiencing a heavy impact on the health and social care systems, especially the public sector. The HRS/Broward County Public Health Unit, working with the Public Health Trust/Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami, developed a case managed comprehensive network of services for persons with AIDS, emphasizing outpatient care, home health and support services. Working with community-based organizations and with the AIDS support group is critical to the success of such a project. One of the major goals is to decrease the burden on tax-assisted hospitals. Public health units in Florida are challenged to provide leadership in health care delivery to the underserved, and AIDS care is compatible with this concept. Unresolved issues remain regarding interactions with hospitals, regionalization and long-term funding.

Document 10 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Service Delivery Reforms to Make Health Systems People-Centered Health systems have often been organized around the needs of those who provide health care services, such as clinicians and policymakers. The result is a centralization of services or the provision of vertical programs that target single diseases. The principles of primary health Extend to uninsured Depth: which benefits Height: what proportion of the costs is covered? Public expenditure on health are covered? Breadth: who is insured?

This “people-centered” approach aims to provide health care that is both more effective and appropriate.
Document 11 (Title: Managed Care Economics -- Issues of Concern -- Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs)): An HMO involves preventive medical care services, capitation, prepaid premiums, a limited panel of primary care physicians (PCP), and specialists. HMOs frequently require healthcare plan members to choose physicians and hospitals in-network and only pay for the services obtained from in-network, making it more restrictive. Financial risk-bearing for providers is 1 of the main concerns on the HMO part; for instance, PCPs must share financial risk with specialists. HMOs usually use capitation, risk pools, and withholds to control physician and patient behavior, consequently controlling overutilization to achieve cost containment.

Document 13 (Title: Health Maintenance Organization -- Clinical Significance): From a patient’s perspective, HMOs represent a potential option for health insurance. HMOs provide medical care for their patients for a prepaid fee. Compared to other common health insurance plans, such as preferred provider organizations (PPOs), HMOs are generally less expensive. Patients with an HMO must have a primary care provider (PCP). These patients usually need to receive referrals from their PCP to receive coverage to see a specialist. For this reason, the PCP is sometimes referred to as a “gatekeeper” as they are the first providers to evaluate patients before sending patients to specialists if necessary. [7] Additionally, patients with an HMO generally only receive coverage to see providers within their HMO network - referred to as “in-network” providers. There are exceptions to this, notably in emergencies.
Document 14 (Title: Contractual arrangements between residency programs and HMOs.): Although one out of seven health maintenance organizations (HMOs) is directly involved in graduate medical education (GME), either as an accredited sponsoring organization or through a contractual agreement with an academic medical center or teaching hospital to serve as an ambulatory rotation site, relatively little is known about the extent to which HMOs have provider contracts with faculty or residents of GME programs. Such provider contracts are not agreements to collaborate on the education of residents, but rather contractual arrangements under which individual physicians or groups (who happen to be residents or faculty) agree to provide services to HMO enrollees in return for some form of compensation. In 1990, the Group Health Association of America conducted a survey of a sample of residency training programs in family medicine, internal medicine, and pediatrics to ascertain the extent to which (1) residents and faculty of residency training programs are participating physicians in HMOs; and (2) HMO enrollees are serving as the patient base for GME in ambulatory settings. Overall, 42% of the residency program respondents indicated that they contract with HMOs to provide services to enrollees. Nearly two thirds (64%) of family practice programs have provider contracts as compared with 28% of pediatrics programs and 24% of internal medicine programs. Provider contracts with independent practice associations are by far the most common, followed by group, network, and staff model contracts, in that order. It is apparent that provider contractual arrangements between HMOs and primary care residency programs are quite common, especially in the area of family practice. These contractual arrangements have probably resulted in a more predictable and stable patient revenue base for residency programs. The long-term effects on provider practice styles and the financing of graduate medical education are less clear.
Document 15 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): making it the leading state in terms of number of ASCs. It is followed by Florida with 417 ASCs and Texas with 366 ASCs. Vermont and the U.S. Virgin Islands have the lowest number of ASCs with one each.13Painmanagement10%Urology5%Orthopedics15%Plastic8%Gi14%Ophthalmology30%Other18%Figure 52-8.

Patient satisfac-tion with same-day surgery has remained relatively high since ASCs started in 1970. It is important to recognize that patients undergoing generally nonemergent surgery that does not require a hospital stay are relatively satisfied overall. Historically, the field of ambulatory surgery has been associated with very high patient satisfaction.14-15 In the future, the CMS Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) sur-vey will report on nationwide patient satisfaction with ASCs and
