Document 1 (Title: Listeria monocytogenes activation of human peripheral blood lymphocytes: induction of non-major histocompatibility complex-restricted cytotoxic activity and cytokine production.): Gram-negative bacteria have been shown to activate human natural killer (NK) cells. In this report, we show that the gram-positive bacterium Listeria monocytogenes can also activate human NK cells with regard to non-major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-restricted killing and the production of cytokines. Overnight incubation of peripheral blood mononuclear (PBM) cells or enriched NK cell populations with live or Formalin-fixed L. monocytogenes resulted in high levels of non-MHC-restricted cytotoxic activity. Listeria-stimulated non-MHC-restricted cytotoxic activity could be achieved with pathogenic as well as nonpathogenic Listeria strains. PBM cells also produced tumor necrosis factor alpha and different interferons (IFNs) after incubation with Listeria strains. Optimal cytokine production appeared to be dependent on nylon wool- and plastic-adherent cells. Different IFNs were produced by Listeria-stimulated PBM cells obtained from different donors. IFN-gamma was always produced but was sometimes associated with IFN-alpha and/or IFN-beta. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) activity was never detected in culture supernatants obtained from Listeria-stimulated PBM cell cultures. However, IL-2 appeared to be produced by Listeria-stimulated PBM cells, since antibody to IL-2 inhibited Listeria-stimulated NK cell cytotoxic activity. Listeria activation of NK cell cytotoxic activity was also dependent on tumor necrosis factor alpha production. Antibody to IFN-gamma, IFN-beta, or IFN-alpha had no effect on Listeria-stimulated NK cell cytotoxic activity. These results demonstrate that NK cells can be activated by Listeria strains and add further evidence that NK cells may play an important role in host defense against bacterial infections.
Document 2 (Title: Mesophile): Examples Some notable mesophiles include Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli. Other examples of species of mesophiles are Clostridium kluyveri, Pseudomonas maltophilia, Thiobacillus novellus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Different types of diseases and infections typically have pathogens from mesophilic bacteria such as the ones listed above. Listeria monocytogenes Listeria monocytogenes is a gram-positive bacterium. It is closely related to Bacillus and Staphylococcus. It is a rod-shaped, facultative anaerobe that is motile by peritrichous flagella. L. monocytogenes motility is limited from 20 °C to 25 °C. At the optimal temperature, it loses its motility. This bacterium is responsible for listeriosis which derives from contaminated food.
Document 3 (Title: Ampicillin -- Indications -- FDA-approved Indications): Respiratory tract infection: caused by: Streptococcus pneumoniae , penicillinase, and non-penicillinase-producing Staphylococcus aureus , group A beta-hemolytic Streptococci, Hemophilus influenzae . Bacterial meningitis: caused by Gram-negative bacteria: Neisseria meningitis , Escherichia coli , Gram-positive bacteria: Listeria monocytogenes, Group B Streptococci . Adding aminoglycosides increases its effectiveness against gram-negative bacteria. [2] Septicemia and endocarditis: caused by Gram-positive bacteria, including penicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus species , Streptococcus species , and Enterococcus species. Gram-negative bacteria include Escherichia coli , Salmonella species , and Proteus mirabilis . Endocarditis caused by enterococci usually responds to intravenous ampicillin. Adding aminoglycosides with ampicillin may increase its effectiveness when treating endocarditis caused by streptococci. [3]
Document 4 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): 982 Listeria monocytogenes Infections Elizabeth L. Hohmann, Daniel A. Portnoy Listeria monocytogenes is a food-borne pathogen that can cause serious infections, particularly in pregnant women and immunocompromised 176 individuals. A ubiquitous saprophytic environmental bacterium, L. monocytogenes is also a facultative intracellular pathogen with a broad host range. Humans are probably accidental hosts for this microorganism. L. monocytogenes is of interest not only to clinicians but also to basic scientists as a model intracellular pathogen that is used to study basic mechanisms of microbial pathogenesis and host immunity. L. monocytogenes is a facultatively anaerobic, nonsporulating, gram-positive rod that grows over a broad temperature range, including refrigeration temperatures. This organism is motile during growth at low temperatures but much less so at 37°C. The vast majority of cases of human listerial disease can be traced to serotypes 1/2a, 1/2b, and 4.
Document 5 (Title: Listeria Monocytogenes -- Treatment / Management): Since other causes of meningitis include gram-positive organisms such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and gram-negative organisms such as Neisseria meningitidis , Ceftriaxone is added as a treatment regimen . Gentamicin is utilized to mostly cover for gram-negative etiologies of meningitis such as Escherichia coli in the infant population. Finally, Vancomycin is added for Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus coverage. For broad coverage of bacterial meningitis in populations susceptible to L. monocytogenes , consider the following regimens: Less than one month old: Ampicillin plus gentamicin Adults with depressed cellular immunity or older than 50 years old: Vancomycin plus ceftriaxone plus ampicillin
Document 6 (Title: Listeria): Listeria is a genus of bacteria that acts as an intracellular parasite in mammals. Until 1992, 10 species were known, each containing two subspecies. By 2020, 21 species had been identified. The genus is named in honor of the British pioneer of sterile surgery Joseph Lister. Listeria species are Gram-positive, rod-shaped, and facultatively anaerobic, and do not produce endospores. The major human pathogen in the genus Listeria is L. monocytogenes. It is usually the causative agent of the relatively rare bacterial disease listeriosis, an infection caused by eating food contaminated with the bacteria. Listeriosis can cause serious illness in pregnant women, newborns, adults with weakened immune systems and the elderly, and may cause gastroenteritis in others who have been severely infected.

Document 8 (Title: Bacterial Meningitis -- Etiology): Listeria monocytogenes and gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli , Klebsiella , Enterobacter , Pseudomonas aeruginosa are other less common causes. Hemophilus influenzae is still occasionally encountered in nonvaccinated individuals. Nosocomial infections are caused by S. pneumonia , Staphylococcus aureus , Staphylococcus albus , and gram-negative bacilli. As per Thigpen etal. out of the 1670 cases reported in the U.S. during 2003–2007, S. pneumoniae was the predominant infective species (58.0%), followed by GBS (18.1%), N. meningitidis (13.9%), H. influenzae (6.7%), and L. monocytogenes (3.4%). [4] Infectious meningitis may also be caused by viruses, fungi, and protozoa. Meningitis may also be non-infectious in etiology and can be caused by cancer, medications, or inflammatory conditions.

Document 9 (Title: Immunology_Janeway): Some infectious agents, such as the intracellular Gram-positive bacterium Listeria monocytogenes and the Gram-negative bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei, appear to be able to directly license dendritic cells to induce primary CD8 T-cell responses without requirement for CD4 T-cell help (Fig. 11.21). Primary CD8 T-cell responses to L. monocytogenes were examined in mice that were genetically deficient in MHC class II molecules and thus lacked CD4 T cells (see Section 11-23). The numbers of CD8 T cells specific for a particular antigen expressed by the pathogen were measured by using tetrameric peptide:MHC complexes, or peptide:MHC tetramers (see Appendix I, Section A-24), which can identify CD4 or CD8 T cells on the basis of the antigenic specificity of their T-cell receptors. On day 7 of infection, wild-type mice and mice lacking CD4 T cells showed equivalent expansion, and
Document 10 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): S. pneumoniae), and enterococci. It is not active against gram-negative organisms. Vancomycin also displays activity against Bacillus species, Corynebacterium jeikeium, Listeria monocytogenes, and gram-positive anaerobes such as Peptostreptococcus, Actinomyces, Clostridium, and Propionibacterium species. Vancomycin has several important clinical uses. It is used for serious infections caused by MRSA, including health care–associated pneumonia, bacteremia, osteomyelitis, and endocarditis. It is also commonly used for skin and soft tissue infections. Oral vancomycin is not absorbed systemically and is reserved for the treatment of Clostridium difficile infection. Vancomycin is also an alternative for the treatment of infections caused by MSSA in patients who cannot tolerate β-lactams. Resistance to vancomycin is a rising concern. Strains of vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (VISA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) are not uncommon. Vancomycin appears to be a
Document 11 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): community-acquired infections in adults when smears show no organisms. IV vancomycin (1 g every 12 h) is used if there are gram-positive cocci on the smear. If methicillin-resistant S. aureus is an unlikely pathogen (e.g., when it is not widespread in the community), either oxacillin or nafcillin (2 g every 4 h) should be given. In addition, an aminoglycoside or third-generation cephalosporin should be given to IV drug users and to other patients in whom P. aeruginosa may be the responsible agent.
Document 12 (Title: Listeria monocytogenes): Listeria monocytogenes is a Gram-positive bacterium, in the division Firmicutes, named after Joseph Lister. Its ability to grow at temperatures as low as 0 °C permits multiplication at typical refrigeration temperatures, greatly increasing its ability to evade control in human foodstuffs. Motile via flagella at 30 °C and below, but usually not at 37 °C, L. monocytogenes can instead move within eukaryotic cells by explosive polymerization of actin filaments (known as comet tails or actin rockets). Studies suggest up to 10% of human gastrointestinal tracts may be colonized by L. monocytogenes. Nevertheless, clinical diseases due to L. monocytogenes are more frequently recognized by veterinarians, especially as meningoencephalitis in ruminants. See: listeriosis in animals.
Document 13 (Title: Listeria): Background The first documented case of listeriosis was in 1924. In the late 1920s, two researchers independently identified L. monocytogenes from animal outbreaks. They proposed the genus Listerella in honor of surgeon and early antiseptic advocate Joseph Lister, but that name was already in use for a slime mold and a protozoan. Eventually, the genus Listeria was proposed and accepted. All species within the genus Listeria are Gram-positive, catalase-positive rods and do not produce endospores. The genus Listeria was classified in the family Corynebacteriaceae through the seventh edition (1957) of Bergey's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology. The 16S rRNA cataloging studies of Stackebrandt, et al. demonstrated that L. monocytogenes is a distinct taxon within the Lactobacillus-Bacillus branch of the bacterial phylogeny constructed by Woese. In 2004, the genus was placed in the newly created family Listeriaceae. The only other genus in the family is Brochothrix.
Document 14 (Title: Survey of neonatal meningitis in Australia: 1987-1989.): To identify incidence, bacterial aetiology, outcome after treatment and risk factors for poor outcome of neonatal meningitis. Retrospective survey of neonatal meningitis occurring in Australia between January 1987 and December 1989. Data were obtained from Medical Records and Microbiology Departments of hospitals with neonatal nurseries. Neonatal nurseries throughout Australia. 116 infants under 6 weeks of age with bacterial or fungal meningitis. The minimum incidence was 0.17 per 1000 live births. Traditional neonatal pathogens were responsible for 60% of cases (group B streptococci, 35%; Escherichia coli, 22%), childhood meningeal pathogens for 10% and opportunistic pathogens for 30%. Risk factors for meningitis, including prematurity, were more common among those with meningitis due to E. coli or opportunistic pathogens than among those with infections due to group B streptococci, Listeria monocytogenes or the childhood pathogens (46/60 v. 11/55; P less than 0.0001). Meningitis was more likely to be due to Gram-negative bacteria in premature infants (less than 36 weeks gestation) than in full-term infants (19/30 v. 20/86; P = 0.0002). The mortality overall was 26% but was higher in extremely premature infants (less than 29 weeks) (6/9 v. 24/107; P = 0.009) and among 13 patients who were judged to have had inappropriate initial therapy (7/13 v. 21/97; P = 0.04). Long-term sequelae occurred in at least 23% of survivors, but were more common in those with Gram-negative meningitis (6/10 v. 13/76; P = 0.012). Initial therapy with penicillin or amoxycillin plus cefotaxime is appropriate for most infants with bacterial meningitis. Since some less common Gram-negative bacteria isolated in this survey were resistant to cefotaxime, an aminoglycoside should be added, initially, in Gram-negative meningitis.
Document 15 (Title: In-vitro activity of LY146032 against Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Corynebacterium JK, and Bacillus spp., in comparison with various antibiotics.): The in-vitro activity of LY146032 was studied against Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Corynebacterium JK, and Bacillus spp. in comparison with several agents with action against Gram-positive bacteria. LY146032 showed an MIC90 of 0.4 mg/l for S. aureus, regardless of the resistance to penicillin or oxacillin. LY146032 was equivalent in activity to ciprofloxacin and vancomycin against S. aureus and moderately active against other species tested (MIC90, 0.8-3.2 mg/l).
