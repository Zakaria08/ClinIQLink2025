Document 1 (Title: Orthotopic liver transplants necessitated by acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity.): Acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity has been recognized since 1966. Patients experiencing a massive hepatic insult due to acetaminophen (APAP) may recover with minimal residual complications or develop fulminant hepatic necrosis. We report 3 patients with hepatic failure due to an APAP overdose who received orthotopic liver transplants and survived. An 18-y-o female ingested 60 500 mg APAP tablets (30 g). She presented with tachycardia and lethargy stating that she had taken amoxipine, carbamazepine, and lorazepam. She began to recover but on day 2 experienced an upper gastrointestinal bleed and became hypotensive and hyperpyrexic. She developed hepatic encephalopathy and it was then determined she had ingested APAP. Her APAP level was 13 micrograms/ml 96 h post-ingestion. She was successfully transplanted 19 d post-ingestion with recovery. A 40-y-o female was admitted for flu-like symptoms persisting for 7 d. She was jaundiced, hyperventilating and hypotensive. She admitted ingesting approximately 17 g APAP over 36 h. Her APAP level was 12.2 micrograms/ml. Her condition worsened and on day 3 she was in grade IV coma. She was successfully transplanted 4 d post-arrival with recovery. A 16-y-o female ingested an unknown amount of APAP. She presented approximately 24 h post-ingestion with a serum APAP level of 130 micrograms/ml. Her condition deteriorated and she became encephalopathic with grade IV coma. She was successfully transplanted on day 7 post-arrival. Hepatotoxicity can occur as a result of either acute or chronic APAP overdose. Although n-acetylcysteine (NAC) is effective antidotal therapy, it must be used within 8-12 h post-ingestion to be optimally effective. Inaccurate patient histories may prevent NAC administration resulting in hepatotoxicity. Liver transplantation is a viable option to be considered in those APAP overdose patients who experience rapidly progressing encephalopathy, hemolysis, and hepato-renal failure.
Document 2 (Title: Case Study: 33-Year-Old Female Presents with Chronic SOB and Cough (Archived) -- Case Presentation): History of Present Illness: A 33-year-old white female presents after admission to the general medical/surgical hospital ward with a chief complaint of shortness of breath on exertion. She reports that she was seen for similar symptoms previously at her primary care physician’s office six months ago. At that time, she was diagnosed with acute bronchitis and treated with bronchodilators, empiric antibiotics, and a short course oral steroid taper. This management did not improve her symptoms, and she has gradually worsened over six months. She reports a 20-pound (9 kg) intentional weight loss over the past year. She denies camping, spelunking, or hunting activities. She denies any sick contacts. A brief review of systems is negative for fever, night sweats, palpitations, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, neural sensation changes, muscular changes, and increased bruising or bleeding. She admits a cough, shortness of breath, and shortness of breath on exertion.
Document 3 (Title: Biochemistry_Lippinco): Choose the ONE best answer. .1. A 30-year-old woman of Northern European ancestry presents with progressive dyspnea (shortness of breath). She denies the use of cigarettes. Family history reveals that her sister also has problems with her lungs. Which one of the following etiologies most likely explains this patient’s pulmonary symptoms? A. Deficiency in dietary vitamin C B. Deficiency of α1-antitrypsin C. Deficiency of prolyl hydroxylase D. Decreased elastase activity E. Increased collagenase activity
Document 4 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): A 59-year-old woman presents to an urgent care clinic with a 4-day history of frequent and painful urination. She has had fevers, chills, and flank pain for the past 2 days. Her physician advised her to come immediately to the clinic for evaluation. In the clinic she is febrile (38.5°C [101.3°F]) but otherwise stable and states she is not experiencing any nausea or vomiting. Her urine dipstick test is positive for leukocyte esterase. Urinalysis and urine culture are ordered. Her past medical history is significant for three urinary tract infections in the past year. Each episode was uncom-plicated, treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and promptly resolved. She also has osteoporosis for which she takes a daily calcium supplement. The decision is made to treat her with oral antibiotics for a complicated urinary tract infection with close follow-up. Given her history, what would be a reasonable empiric antibiotic choice? Depending on the antibiotic choice are there potential drug
Document 5 (Title: Calcifediol): This test can be used to diagnose vitamin D deficiency, and is performed in people with high risk for vitamin D deficiency, when the results of the test can be used to support beginning replacement therapy with vitamin D supplements. Patients with osteoporosis, chronic kidney disease, malabsorption, obesity, and some other infections may be at greater risk for being vitamin D-deficient and so are more likely to have this test. Although vitamin D deficiency is common in some populations including those living at higher latitudes or with limited sun exposure, the 25(OH)D test is not usually requested for the entire population. Physicians may advise low risk patients to take over-the-counter vitamin D supplements in place of having screening.
Document 6 (Title: [A case of idiopathic hypoparathyroidism complicated with chronic thyroiditis].): It has been suggested that autoimmunity and genetic factors may play a specific role in the development of idiopathic hypoparathyroidism. We reported a case of idiopathic hypoparathyroidism complicated with chronic thyroiditis. The patient, a woman 40 years old, visited our clinic because of tetany of both hands and dizziness. She was of short stature with a round face. She also had a goiter, hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia and decreased parathyroidal function, but renal function was normal. Her TSH level was slightly high with a positive microsome test (x 1600), and the levels of thyroid hormones tended to be low. Based on Ellsworth-Howard test findings, a diagnosis of idiopathic hypoparathyroidism was made, with the complication of chronic thyroiditis confirmed by the thyroidal biopsy. Administration of l alpha-OH-D3 normalized the level of serum calcium. No special treatment was given for the chronic thyroiditis in order to observe its natural course. Her TSH returned to normal, and the level of thyroid hormones was increased to normal ranges. Tests were positive for anti-adrenal antibody and anti-gastric antibody. The complication of chronic thyroiditis, an autoimmune disease, and a positive finding for every antibody suggested the possible involvement of autoimmunity in the mechanism of development of idiopathic hypoparathyroidism. The administration of 1 alpha-OH-D3 resulted in an increase in the serum calcium level and also normalization of levels of TSH and thyroid hormones. Thus, it is likely that the elevation of the calcium ion or immunoregulation by active vitamin D may have induced the increase in thyroid hormone secretion.
Document 7 (Title: Fatigue): Causes Fatigue is a normal result of work, mental stress, anxiety, overstimulation and understimulation, jet lag, active recreation, boredom, lack of sleep or disease. Acute Causes of acute fatigue include depression; chemical causes, such as dehydration, poisoning, low blood sugar, or mineral or vitamin deficiencies. Fatigue is different from drowsiness, where a patient feels that sleep is required. Temporary fatigue is likely to be a minor illness like the common cold as one part of the sickness behavior response that happens when the immune system fights an infection. Prolonged Prolonged fatigue is a self-reported, persistent (constant) fatigue lasting at least one month. Chronic Chronic fatigue is a self-reported fatigue lasting at least six consecutive months. Chronic fatigue may be either persistent or relapsing. Chronic fatigue is a symptom of many diseases and conditions. Some major categories of conditions that feature fatigue include:
Document 8 (Title: Calcifediol): Calcifediol may have advantages over cholecalciferol for the correction of vitamin D deficiency states. A review of the results of nine randomized control trials which compared oral doses of both, found that calcifediol was 3.2-fold more potent than cholecalciferol. Calcifediol is better absorbed from the intestine and has greater affinity for the vitamin-D-binding protein, both of which increase its bioavailability. Orally administered calcifediol has a much shorter half-life with faster elimination. These properties may be beneficial in people with intestinal malabsorption, obesity, or treated with certain other medications. In 2016, the FDA approved a formulation of calcifediol (Rayaldee) 60 microgram daily as a prescription medication to treat secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with chronic kidney disease.

Document 9 (Title: First_Aid_Step2): GI symptoms are more prominent in infancy, while pulmonary manifestations predominate thereafter. Additional symptoms include type 2 DM, a “salty taste,” male infertility (agenesis of the vas deferens), and unexplained hyponatremia. Patients are at risk for fat-soluble vitamin deficiency (vitamins A, D, E, and K) 2° to malabsorption and may present with manifestations of these deficiencies. Sweat chloride test > 60 mEq/L for those < 20 years of age and > 80 mEq/L in adults; DNA probe test. Most states now perform mandatory newborn screening, but occasional false positives do occur, so children must be brought in for a sweat test to distinguish disease from a carrier state. The sweat chloride test has traditionally been considered the gold standard for the diagnosis of CF, but conf rmatory genetic analysis is now routinely done. T AB LE 2.1 3-3.

Document 10 (Title: Gluten-sensitive enteropathy–associated conditions): Deficiencies Avitaminosis. Avitaminosis caused by malabsorption in GSE can result in decline of fat soluble vitamins and vitamin B, as well as malabsorption of essential fatty acids. This can cause a wide variety of secondary problems. Hypocalcinemia is also associated with GSE. In treated GSE, the restrictions on diet as well as reduced absorption as a result of prolonged damage may result in post treatment deficiencies. Vitamin A – Poor absorption of vitamin A has been seen in coeliac disease. and it has been suggested that GSE-associated cancers of the esophagus may be related to vitamin A deficiency Folate deficiency – Folate deficiency is believed to be primary to the following secondary conditions: Megaloblastic anemia Calcification of brain channels – epilepsy, dementia, visual manifestations.

She denies alcohol and illicit drug use. She is in a married, monogamous relationship and has three children aged 15 months to 5 years. She is employed in a cookie bakery. She has two pet doves. She traveled to Mexico for a one-week vacation one year ago. Allergies: No known medicine, food, or environmental allergies. Past Medical History: Hypertension Past Surgical History: Cholecystectomy Medications: Lisinopril 10 mg by mouth every day
Document 12 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Vitamin D deficiency (Chap. 96e) due to decreased intake, decreased absorption, or impaired vitamin D metabolism (as occurs in renal disease) may lead to chronic muscle weakness. Pain reflects the underlying bone disease (osteomalacia). Vitamin E deficiency may result from malabsorption. Clinical manifestations include ataxic neuropathy due to loss of proprioception and myopathy with proximal weakness. Progressive external ophthalmoplegia is a distinctive finding. It has not 462e-19 been established that deficiency of other vitamins causes a myopathy. Systemic illnesses such as chronic respiratory, cardiac, or hepatic failure are frequently associated with severe muscle wasting and complaints of weakness. Fatigue is usually a more significant problem than weakness, which is typically mild.
Document 13 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): Charles DeBattista, MD house and has no motivation, interest, or energy to pursue recreational activities that she once enjoyed such as hiking. She describes herself as “chronically miserable and worried all the time.” Her medical history is notable for chronic neck pain from a motor vehicle accident for which she is being treated with tramadol and meperidine. In addition, she is on hydrochlorothiazide and propranolol for hypertension. The patient has a history of one depressive episode after a divorce that was treated successfully with fluoxetine. Medical workup including complete blood cell count, thyroid func-tion tests, and a chemistry panel reveals no abnormalities. She is started on fluoxetine for a presumed major depressive episode and referred for cognitive behavioral psychotherapy. What CYP450 and pharmacodynamic interactions might be associated with fluoxetine use in this patient? Which class of antidepressants would be contraindicated in this patient? A 47-year-old woman
