Document 1 (Title: Prophylactic ankle bracing.): Many choices are available to athletes seeking an ankle support. The time-honored tradition of ankle taping with adhesive tape does offer protection against ankle sprains during activity. Laced stabilizers offer an equal or possibly greater amount of support, are less costly and easier to apply, and can be retightened frequently during activity. The physician should become familiar with one of these two methods and choose one based on availability and feasibility in the community. The air stirrup may be indicated for patients with a history of ankle injury who are undergoing a graduated rehabilitation program. Nevertheless, the air stirrup has not been shown to provide significantly greater inversion restriction than taping or lace-on braces and is not recommended as a first-line method of support for individuals with no history of recent ankle sprain. High-top shoes are better when the ankle is taped, although low-top shoes are better when a laced stabilizer is worn. Elastic guards help reduce ankle edema but do not provide ankle stability.
Document 2 (Title: Programmed cell death): Basic morphological and biochemical features of PCD have been conserved in both plant and animal kingdoms. Specific types of plant cells carry out unique cell-death programs. These have common features with animal apoptosis—for instance, nuclear DNA degradation—but they also have their own peculiarities, such as nuclear degradation triggered by the collapse of the vacuole in tracheary elements of the xylem. Janneke Balk and Christopher J. Leaver, of the Department of Plant Sciences, University of Oxford, carried out research on mutations in the mitochondrial genome of sun-flower cells. Results of this research suggest that mitochondria play the same key role in vascular plant PCD as in other eukaryotic cells.
Document 3 (Title: Pathology_Robbins): (glucose, glutamine, ISCHEMIA, ATP Lipid, protein building blocks Fig. 1.11 Roles of the mitochondria. Besides the efficient generation of ATP from carbohydrate and fatty acid substrates, mitochondria play an important role in intermediary metabolism, serving as the source of molecules used to synthesize lipids and proteins, and they also are centrally involved in cell life and-death decisions. Mitochondria provide the enzymatic machinery for oxidative phosphorylation (and thus the relatively efficient generation of energy from glucose and fatty acid substrates). They also have central roles in anabolic metabolism and the regulation programmed cell death, so-called “apoptosis” ( Fig. 1.11
Document 4 (Title: Necrosis -- Mechanisms): Necrotic death is almost always associated with an inflammatory response. Necrotic cells release factors like high mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1), and hepatoma-derived growth factor (HDGF). [18] [19] These factors are sensed by a nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3), which is a core protein of the inflammasome. [20] This results in inflammasome activation and causes the release of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL1β. NLRP3 inflammasome activation is triggered mainly through ATP produced by mitochondria released from damaged cells. [21] Necrosis does not typically correlate with activation of caspases, and it appears that it causes cell demise in response to damage or pathology, but not during normal development. Despite this, it turns out that a programmed form of necrotic death (termed necroptosis ) is very common in vivo, mainly in diverse forms of neurodegeneration and death inflicted by ischemia or infection. Unlike unordered necrosis, necroptosis is a more physiological and programmed type of necroptotic death and shares several key processes with apoptosis. It occurs due to the activation of the kinase domain of the receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1) and the assembly of the RIP1/RIP3-containing signaling complex. It is triggered by tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family members, needs caspase 8 inhibition, and assembly of necrosome (RIPK1-RIPK3 complex IIb). [9] [19]
Document 5 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): to nutrient deprivation, or consti-tutive activation of autophagy in response to stress, can lead to cell death; thus, autophagy is sometimes referred to as a second form of programmed cell death. Autophagy plays an essential role during starvation, cellular differentiation, cell death, and aging. Autophagy is also involved in the elimination of cancer cells by triggering a nonapoptotic cell death program, which suggests a negative role in tumor development. Mouse models that are heterozygotes for the beclin 1 gene, an important gene for autophagy, have altered autophagic response and show a high incidence of spontaneous tumors, which establishes a role for autophagy in tumor suppression.21 This also suggests that mutations in other genes operating in this pathway may con-tribute to tumor formation through deregulation of autophagy. However, autophagy also acts as a stress response mechanism to protect cancer cells from low nutrient supply or therapeu-tic insults. Thus, in cancer,
Document 6 (Title: Programmed cell death): Mitochondriate eukaryotic cells live poised between life and death, because mitochondria still retain their repertoire of molecules that can trigger cell suicide. It is not clear why apoptotic machinery is maintained in the extant unicellular organisms. This process has now been evolved to happen only when programmed. to cells (such as feedback from neighbors, stress or DNA damage), mitochondria release caspase activators that trigger the cell-death-inducing biochemical cascade. As such, the cell suicide mechanism is now crucial to all of our lives. Programmed death of entire organisms Clinical significance ABL The BCR-ABL oncogene has been found to be involved in the development of cancer in humans. c-Myc c-Myc is involved in the regulation of apoptosis via its role in downregulating the Bcl-2 gene. Its role the disordered growth of tissue. Metastasis A molecular characteristic of metastatic cells is their altered expression of several apoptotic genes. See also
Document 7 (Title: Jasmonate): Following its role in defense, JAs have also been implicated in cell death and leaf senescence. JA can interact with many kinases and transcription factors associated with senescence. JA can also induce mitochondrial death by inducing the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROSs). These compounds disrupt mitochondria membranes and compromise the cell by causing apoptosis, or programmed cell death. JAs' roles in these processes are suggestive of methods by which the plant defends itself against biotic challenges and limits the spread of infections.
Document 8 (Title: Topoisomerase): Topoisomerase is also found in the mitochondria of cells. The mitochondria generate ATP as well as playing a role in programmed cell death and aging. The mitochondrial DNA of animal cells is a circular, double-stranded DNA that requires the activity of topoisomerase to be replicated. The classes of topoisomerase found in the mitochondria are I, IIβ, IIIα.
Document 9 (Title: Bortezomib -- Mechanism of Action): Bortezomib is a proteasome inhibitor. The proteasomal system plays a vital role in cellular protein turnover, which is essential for the homeostasis of cells. Bortezomib reversibly binds to the chymotrypsin-like subunit of the 26S proteasome, resulting in its inhibition and preventing the degradation of various pro-apoptotic factors. [4] [5] The accumulation will eventually activate the programmed cell death via caspase-mediated pathways in the neoplastic cells that are usually dependent on the suppression of pro-apoptotic pathways for their proliferation and survival.
Document 10 (Title: Insect muscle as a model for programmed cell death.): Programmed cell death (PCD) is a fundamental component of development in virtually all animals. Despite the ubiquity of this phenomenon, little is known about what tells a cell to die, and less still about the physiological and molecular mechanisms that bring about death. One system that has proven to be very amenable for the study of PCD is the intersegmental muscle (ISM) of the tobacco hawkmoth Manduca sexta. These giant muscle cells are used during the eclosion (emergence) behavior of the adult moth, and then die during the subsequent 30 h. This review uses the ISMs as a model system to address questions that are basic to any cell death system, including the following: (1) how do cells know when to die; (2) what physiological changes accompany death; (3) what are the molecular mechanisms that mediate death; and (4) do all cells die by the same process? For the ISMs, the trigger for PCD is a decline in the circulating titer of the insect molting hormone, 20-hydroxyecdysone (20-HE). During cell death there are rapid decreases in both the myofibrillar sensitivity to intracellular calcium and the resulting force of fiber contraction. The ability of the ISMs to undergo PCD requires the repression and activation of specific genes. Two of the repressed genes encode actin and myosin. One of the upregulated presumptive cell-death genes encodes polyubiquitin, which appears to play a critical role in the rapid proteolysis that accompanies ISM death.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Document 11 (Title: Function of the follicular dendritic cell in the germinal center of lymphoid follicles.): The authors made an immunocytochemical examination of the germinal centers (GCs) of (1) lymph follicles in physiological lymph nodes and (2) extra-nodal tissues of divergent diseases including thyroid disorders, rheumatoid arthritis, Warthin's tumor and Kimura's disease (Eosinophilic lymphfolliculoid granuloma). In these germinal centers, the presence of immunoglobulins (IgG and IgM), early acting complement components (C1q, C4, C3c, C3d), receptors for C3b and C3d and dendritic reticulum cell-1 was demonstrated in lace-like network patterns which were proven electron-microscopically to coincide with the surface of follicular dendritic cells. IgE was distributed in a lace-like pattern in the GCs of proliferating follicles of Kimura's disease, in which the lysis of follicles was frequently observed. This lysis appeared to be related to the presence of complement components. In the germinal centers of extra-nodal tissues, including the thyroid tissues accompanying the lymph follicles, rheumatoid arthritis synovial tissues as well as Warthin's tumors, thyroglobulin, rheumatoid factor and salivary amylase were detected as specific antigens, occurring in lace-like patterns. It is possible that follicular dendritic cells may play a role in the genesis of GCs and be responsible for the immune response through C3 receptors.
Document 12 (Title: Standardization of Standardized Patient Training in Medical Simulation  -- Continuing Education): Continuous training is essential for SPs to maintain a quality SBE program. SPs are often recruited to play multiple roles and case assignments during an academic term or across hospital settings. For example, an SP may be asked to portray a patient with an acute illness for a nursing program one day and a spinal cord injury patient for a physical therapy program the next. In hospital settings, an SP may play the role of an unhappy spouse in a morning session or a grieving parent during the afternoon session. Such variations within a simulation program require ongoing case-specific training to ensure SPs' understanding of complex medical equipment and the overall case content, necessitating ongoing collaboration with course faculty to ensure the meeting of learner objectives. It is also critically important for SBE programs to provide frequent SP check-ins to ascertain SP psychological safety due to the many complex roles SPs are asked to play.
Document 13 (Title: Cardiac Electrical and Structural Remodeling -- Introduction): Even with the falling rates of cardiovascular deaths, the events of deaths attributable to sudden cardiac death keep rising. [1] A total of 350000 events of sudden cardiac death are estimated to occur in the United States every year. Coronary artery disease often leads to complex electrical and structural remodeling of the heart due to myocardial injury. This remodeling is the root cause that precipitates ventricular arrhythmias, which often lead to sudden cardiac death. Cardiac remodeling occurs in response to stress, either functional stress or structural stress. This remodeling plays a vital role in the disease process that ensues. Initially, the electrical and structural remodeling helps in compensating the cardiac performance. But over time, these compensatory mechanisms often lead to pump failure and/or fatal arrhythmias. [2] Both atria and ventricles are affected by electrical remodeling. This process eventually leads to atrial fibrillation and fatal ventricular arrhythmias. [3] Structural remodeling of the heart can be physiologic growth occurring in response to exercise, pregnancy, or during the postnatal period. It can also be pathologic hypertrophy in response to neurohumoral activation, injury to myocardium, or hypertension. Heart failure and malignant arrhythmia are often precipitated by pathological hypertrophy of the heart. However, they don’t occur with the physiological growth of the heart. [2]
Document 14 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, plays an important role in both physiologic and pathologic conditions. During embryogenesis, apoptotic pathways operate to destroy neurons that fail to differentiate appropriately or reach their intended targets. There is mounting evidence for an increased rate of apoptotic cell death in a variety of acute and chronic neurologic diseases. Apoptosis is characterized by neuronal shrinkage, chromatin condensation, and DNA fragmentation, whereas necrotic cell death is associated with cytoplasmic and mitochondrial swelling followed by dissolution of the cell membrane. Apoptotic and necrotic cell death can coexist or be sequential events, depending on the severity of the initiating insult. Cellular energy reserves appear to have an important role in these two forms of cell death, with apoptosis favored under conditions in which ATP levels are preserved. Evidence of DNA fragmentation has been found in a number of degenerative neurologic disorders,
Document 15 (Title: Myocardial Protection -- Anatomy and Physiology -- Mitochondrial Protection): Mitochondrial protection is crucial because mitochondria, while providing ATP to cardiomyocytes, also play a central role in activating cell death pathways. The mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) is a nonselective channel in the inner mitochondrial membrane that remains closed during ischemia-induced acidosis, offering some protection. However, if the mPTP opens, it leads to depolarization, uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation, intracellular ATP depletion, and cell death. Protecting the heart during ischemia focuses on preventing mPTP opening and promoting the activation of the mitochondrial ATP-dependent potassium channel. This invokes 2 primary protective pathways: the reperfusion injury salvage kinase pathway, activated via G-protein-coupled receptors, and the survivor-activating factor enhancement pathway, which operates through tumor necrosis factor-alpha receptors.
