        "content": "In vitro supplementation with the active form of vitamin B6, pyridoxal-phosphate (PLP), increases measurements of both serum aminotransferase enzymes, L-aspartate: 2-oxoglutarate amino transferase, EC 2.6.1.1 (AST) and L-alanine: 2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase, EC 2.6.1.2 (ALT). The plasma PLP level in normal individuals clearly relates inversely to the degree of stimulation of serum AST and ALT. PLP added in vitro increases the reference values but does not decrease the biological variability of AST measurements in healthy individuals. Since B6 deficiency is observed in alcoholics, in some significant percentage of hospitalized patients and in apparently healthy people over age 64, these individuals will show PLP stimulation of their serum amino-transferase enzymes. Patients with liver disease show lesser activation with PLP of AST activity but not ALT activity than patients with heart disease (myocardial infarction). AST isoenzyme measurements in the form of a mitochondrial AST/total AST ratio may discriminate alcoholic hepatitis from all other hepatic diseases. In renal dialysis patients including transplant patients, it may be desirable to measure the aminotransferases with added PLP in order to reflect better the cytolytic state of the liver. While unconfirmed studies suggest the combination of PLP activation and AST isoenzyme measurements may aid in the diagnosis of hepatoma, PLP activation per se does not provide clear cut improved diagnostic value of AST and ALT in liver diseases. However, in view of PLP incorporation into the IFCC reference methods for AST and ALT, and the National Reference System for the Clinical Laboratory, it is recommended that PLP be included in all AST and ALT measurements.",

Imaging modalities include ultrasonography, computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Ultrasonography, however, is most widely used as it is the least expensive and most available modality. A diagnosis of NAFLD should be made only in the absence of excessive alcohol intake (defined as alcohol consumption of more than 20 g/day for men and more than 10 g/day for women), and other causes of liver disease such as viral hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis, hereditary or drug-induced liver disease. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) are usually mildly elevated at two to five times the upper level of normal with ALT greater than AST in a 2:1 ratio. This pattern of serum aminotransferase elevation helps distinguish NAFLD from alcoholic hepatitis, as the AST is usually greater than ALT in alcoholic hepatitis in a greater than 2:1 ratio. Please note that this pattern flips in NASH with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis and the AST is usually greater than ALT in such cases. Serum alkaline phosphatase can be mildly elevated, usually up to twice the upper limit of normal. Bilirubin, albumin, and INR are usually within the normal limits but will be elevated in patients who develop cirrhosis. Ferritin can be elevated in up to 60% of patients and usually indicates more advanced disease given it is a marker of inflammation.

In vivo 31P NMR of the testes was used to determine the intratesticular pH and the relative concentrations of various phosphorus-containing metabolites. The integrity of the blood-testes barrier was evaluated using 1H NMR imaging following a gadolinium diethylene tetramine pentaacetic acid derivative (Gd-DTPA) administration as a vascular contrast agent.

        "content": "Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels are normal or discretely increased in rats with chronic extrahepatic cholestasis (CEHC). During the acute phase (first 72 h after biliary obstruction), however, serum transaminase values are quite elevated due to a mechanism not yet fully elucidated. Thus, this is a good experimental model, not involving hepatocellular necrosis, for the study of serum ALT and AST levels during the acute phase of CEHC. Male Wistar rats (250-350 g) were divided into two groups: group A (N = 60) was submitted to sham operation for bile duct ligation (BDL), and group B (N = 60) was submitted to BDL. Thirty and 120 min after BDL there was a 1.5-fold increase in both serum ALT and AST levels compared to sham-operated rats (P less than 0.05). Serum ALT levels were higher than AST levels as early as 30 min after BDL and the highest serum values for both transaminases were observed at 360 min which was also the last value measured. Serum AST levels increased 120 min after BDL, with no further significant increases thereafter.",

        "content": "Alanine transaminase (ALT) is a transaminase enzyme (). It is also called alanine aminotransferase (ALT or ALAT) and was formerly called serum glutamate-pyruvate transaminase or serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) and was first characterized in the mid-1950s by Arthur Karmen and colleagues. ALT is found in plasma and in various body tissues but is most common in the liver. It catalyzes the two parts of the alanine cycle. Serum ALT level, serum AST (aspartate transaminase) level, and their ratio (AST/ALT ratio) are commonly measured clinically as biomarkers for liver health. The tests are part of blood panels. The half-life of ALT in the circulation approximates 47 hours. Aminotransferase is cleared by sinusoidal cells in the liver. Function ALT catalyzes the transfer of an amino group from L-alanine to \u03b1-ketoglutarate, the products of this reversible transamination reaction being pyruvate and L-glutamate. L-alanine + \u03b1-ketoglutarate \u21cc pyruvate + L-glutamate",
