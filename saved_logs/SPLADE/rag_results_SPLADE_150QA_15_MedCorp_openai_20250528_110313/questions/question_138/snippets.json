Three homologous proteins, CD1a, b and c, have been defined serologically, and the CD1 gene locus on human chromosome 1 contains five potential CD1 genes. Analysis of the predicted amino-acid sequences of CD1 molecules reveals a low but significant level of homology to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and class II molecules, and, like MHC class I molecules, CD1 molecules are associated non-covalently with beta 2-microglobulin. These structural similarities to known antigen-presenting molecules, together with the expression of CD1 on cells capable of antigen presentation, suggest a role for CD1 molecules in antigen recognition by T cells. Here we demonstrate the specific recognition of CD1a by a CD4-CD8- alpha beta T-cell receptor (TCR) expressing cytolytic T lymphocyte (CTL) line and the specific recognition of CD1c by a CD4-CD8- gamma delta TCR CTL line. The interaction of CD1-specific CTLs with CD1+ target cells appeared to involve the CD3-TCR complex, and did not show evidence of MHC restriction.

These non-A,B,C class I genes, designated as HLA-E, HLA-F, and HLA-G, are on the short arm of chromosome 6 and part of the HLA class I gene family. Although the human HLA-E, -F, and -G genes have features in common with the murine Qa- and Tla-genes, e.g. little allelic polymorphism, their relationship to the murine Qa- and Tla-region genes remains unclear. It has been suggested that the nonclassical MHC class I molecules function as ligands for gamma-delta T lymphocytes. The speculation is supported by the recent reports of a murine Qa-1 restricted gamma-delta T cell hybridoma and recognition of a TL antigen by gamma delta T cell receptors. The amino acid sequences of the HLA-E, -F, and -G encoded proteins suggest that each protein is likely to fold three-dimensionally into a structure very similar to HLA-A2 and has a capability of presenting a bound peptide at the cell surface. In light of the possible role of bound peptide in the expression of a class I molecule at the cell surface, it is interesting to note that the HLA-E and HLA-F molecules, even in association with beta 2-microglobulin, could not be detected at the cell surface of a transfected B-LCL. In contrast, the HLA-G molecule was found at the surface of transfected B-LCLs. Both HLA-E and HLA-F are less similar in sequence to HLA-A,B,C than is HLA-G. One explanation would be that the HLA-E and -F molecules have a mutation such that they are no longer able to bind peptide. If the HLA-G molecule does function to present peptide to T lymphocytes, there are features unique to HLA-G that should impact on its ability to perform this function. Both the analysis of HLA-G RNA and protein in trophoblasts indicate that HLA-G, unlike HLA-A, -B, -C, is relatively nonpolymorphic. Since HLA-A,B,C polymorphism is thought to increase the number of different peptides that these molecules can bind, HLA-G is likely to be able to bind a relatively limited variety of peptides.

In the transfected cells the predominant Qa-1 species was present in an immature intracellular form. The expression of mature cell surface Qa-1 was dramatically and selectively increased following heat shock. Furthermore, the addition of a tryptic digest of Mycobacterium bovis 65-kDa heat shock protein stabilized the surface expression of Qa-1b. These observations suggest that the Qa-1 molecule may be involved in the presentation of heat shock protein-derived peptides to the immune system.",

        "content": "Coding potential of the Q6 gene from the Qa-2a region of BALB/c Crgl mice was analyzed by a combination of hybrid class I gene construction and DNA-mediated gene transfer. Recombinant genes were created by exon shuffling of the 5' coding region of the Q6 gene and the 3' coding region of a gene encoding a transplantation antigen (Kd, Dd, or Ld), or the inverse. Some of these hybrid class I genes were expressed in the transfected mouse fibroblasts (L cells). The hybrid class I molecules encoded by the 5' end of the Q6 gene and the 3' end of the Ld gene precipitated as 45,000 mol wt molecules associated with beta 2-microglobulin. The expression of the hybrid proteins indicates that 926 basepairs of the 5' flanking region upstream of the structural Q6 gene contain a promoter that functions as a transcription initiation site in L cells. The 3' portion of the Q6 gene appears to be responsible for the lack of cell surface expression of the intact Q6 and the hybrid Ld/Q6 genes in mouse fibroblasts. Accordingly, this portion of the Q6 class I gene may play a regulatory role in tissue-specific expression. Serological analyses of hybrid Q6 proteins suggested that Q6 may be a structural gene for CR (H-2 crossreactive) antigen found normally on subpopulations of lymphocytes. If this identification is correct, Q6 gene will define a new category of class I genes encoding approximately 40,000 mol wt molecules and carrying a characteristic truncated cytoplasmic tail. Analysis of L cells transfected with Q6 hybrid genes demonstrated also that the cytotoxic T cells specific for Qa-2a region-coded antigens recognize the amino-terminal alpha 1-alpha 2 domain of Q6 fusion products. This recognition can be blocked by anti-Qa-2a alloantiserum and monoclonal antibodies reactive with the alpha 3-beta 2-microglobulin portion of the Q6 hybrids. We propose that the structural requirements for the anti-Qa-2a cytotoxic T lymphocyte-specific epitopes on target molecules are the same as for anti-H-2-alloreactive cytotoxic T lymphocyte determinants on transplantation antigens and that the mechanism of target recognition is similar in both cases. This interpretation is consistent with the following structural similarities found in both categories of class I molecules: (a) Kd and Q6 alpha 1-alpha 2 domains share serologically defined epitopes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",
