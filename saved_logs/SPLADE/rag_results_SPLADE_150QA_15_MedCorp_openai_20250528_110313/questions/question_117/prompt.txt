Document 1 (Title: Renal Failure (Archived) -- Introduction -- Chronic Renal Failure (CRF)): CRF or chronic kidney disease (CKD) is defined as a persistent impairment of kidney function, in other words, abnormally elevated serum creatinine for more than 3 months or calculated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) less than 60 ml per minute / 1.73m2. It often involves a progressive loss of kidney function necessitating renal replacement therapy (dialysis or transplantation). When a patient needs renal replacement therapy, the condition is called end-stage renal disease (ESRD). [1] CKD classified based on grade: Grade 1: GFR greater than 90 Grade 2: 60 to 89 Grade 3a: 45 to 59 Grade 3b: 30 to 44 Grade 4: 15 to 29 Grade 5: Less than 15 CKD classified based on stage: Stage 1: GFR greater than 90 Stage 2: 60 to 89 Stage 3: 30 to 59 Stage 4: 15 to 29 Stage 5: Less than 15
Document 2 (Title: Lupus nephritis: prognostic factors in children.): As newer treatment modalities become available for patients with severe lupus nephritis, it becomes increasingly important to identify patients at risk for renal failure. In this study, the records of 90 children presenting with systemic lupus erythematosus over a 13-year period were reviewed. Nineteen were lost to follow-up prior to completion of the study. Of the 71 remaining children, 16 (22%) progressed to chronic renal failure. Persistent hypertension lasting greater than 4 months, anemia, abnormalities of the urinalysis, and elevated serum creatinine level were significantly associated with progression to renal failure. Sex, race, age, abnormalities of creatinine clearance, and 24-hour urine protein collection were not associated with progression to renal failure. Renal biopsies were obtained in 45 children. Biopsies were initially classified according to World Health Organization criteria. Diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis was significantly associated with progression to renal failure. The 45 biopsies available were reviewed by one of the authors and categorized by activity and chronicity indices. Both the active lesions of fibrinoid necrosis, synechiae, tubular casts, and vasculitic lesions and the chronic lesion of glomerular sclerosis correlated with progression to renal failure. Of the 16 children who progressed to renal failure, 2 had cadaver kidney transplants and are well 5 years posttransplant; 4 had fulminant lupus and died within 1 month of commencing dialysis; 10 began chronic dialysis. Five of the 10 children on chronic dialysis died from sepsis. These data suggest that children with systemic lupus erythematosus who undergo dialysis do poorly.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Document 3 (Title: Kidney failure): In the United States acute failure affects about 3 per 1,000 people a year. Chronic failure affects about 1 in 1,000 people with 3 per 10,000 people newly developing the condition each year. Acute failure is often reversible while chronic failure often is not. With appropriate treatment many with chronic disease can continue working. Classification Kidney failure can be divided into two categories: acute kidney failure or chronic kidney failure. The type of renal failure is differentiated by the trend in the serum creatinine; other factors that may help differentiate acute kidney failure from chronic kidney failure include anemia and the kidney size on sonography as chronic kidney disease generally leads to anemia and small kidney size. Acute kidney failure
Document 4 (Title: Valsartan): Kidney failure People treated with ARBs including valsartan or diuretics are susceptible to conditions of developing low renal blood flow such as abnormal narrowing of blood vessel in kidney, hypertension, renal artery stenosis, heart failure, chronic kidney disease, severe congestive heart failure, or volume depletion whose renal function is in part dependent on the activity of the renin-angiotensin system like efferent arteriolar vasoconstriction done by angiotensin II are at high risk of deterioration of renal function comprising acute kidney failure, oliguria, worsening azotemia or heightened serum creatinine. When blood flow to the kidneys is reduced, the kidney activates a series of response that triggers angiotensin release to constrict blood vessels and facilitate blood flow in the kidney. So long as the nephron function degradation is being progressive or reaches clinically significant level, withhold or discontinue valsartan is warranted. Interactions
Document 5 (Title: Role of renal kallikrein in the increased fractional sodium excretion in the rat remnant kidney model of chronic renal failure.): To assess the potential role of renal kallikrein-kinin system in enhancing sodium excretion per nephron in chronic renal failure, we studied urinary excretion of active and inactive kallikrein for 3 weeks in Wistar-Kyoto rats subjected to 5/6 nephrectomy (5/6), 1/2 nephrectomy (1/2) or sham operation (Sham). We determined urinary active and inactive kallikrein by measuring kallikrein activity using a kininogenase assay before and after treatment with trypsin (200 micrograms/ml). Fractional sodium excretion was significantly increased in 5/6-rats as compared with 1/2- or sham-rats. On the contrary, urinary active kallikrein excretion per nephron was not different in the three models whereas a significant rise in urinary inactive kallikrein excretion per nephron was found in 5/6-rats as compared with 1/2- or sham-rats. Urinary total kallikrein excretion per nephron was significantly increased in 5/6-rats as compared with sham-rats. In addition, no correlation was found between fractional sodium excretion and urinary active kallikrein excretion corrected for creatinine clearance (Ccr) in 5/6-rats. These results indicate that decreased excretion of renal active kallikrein may not play a significant role in the increased sodium excretion per nephron in the rat remnant kidney model of chronic renal failure. Furthermore, it is suggested that in this model of rat there might be impaired production of renal active kallikrein although its exact mechanism remains to be determined.
Document 6 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Once GFR reduction has been established, the physician must decide if it represents acute or chronic renal injury. The clinical situation, history, and laboratory data often make this an easy distinction. However, the laboratory abnormalities characteristic of chronic renal failure, including anemia, hypocalcemia, and hyperphosphatemia, often are present as well in patients presenting with acute renal failure. Radiographic evidence of renal osteodystrophy (Chap. 335) can be seen only in chronic renal failure but is a very late finding, and these patients are usually undergoing dialysis. The urinalysis and renal ultrasound can facilitate distinguishing acute from chronic renal failure. An approach to the evaluation of azotemic patients is shown in Fig. 61-1. Patients with advanced chronic renal insufficiency often have some proteinuria, nonconcentrated urine (isosthenuria; isosmotic with plasma), and small kidneys on ultrasound, characterized by increased echogenicity and cortical
Document 7 (Title: Dialysis): In medicine, dialysis (from Greek διάλυσις, dialysis, "dissolution"; from διά, dia, "through, and λύσις, lysis, "loosening or splitting") is the process of removing excess water, solutes, and toxins from the blood in people whose kidneys can no longer perform these functions naturally. This is referred to as renal replacement therapy. The first successful dialysis was performed in 1943. Dialysis may need to be initiated when there is a sudden rapid loss of kidney function, known as acute kidney injury (previously called acute renal failure), or when a gradual decline in kidney function chronic kidney disease reaches stage 5. Stage 5 chronic renal failure is reached when the glomerular filtration rate is 10–15% of normal, creatinine clearance is less than 10 mL per minute and uremia is present.
Document 8 (Title: First_Aid_Step2): Labs may show concurrent hypocalcemia and hypokalemia. ECG may reveal prolonged PR and QT intervals. IV and oral supplements. Hypokalemia and hypocalcemia will not correct without magnesium correction. See Figure 2.16-2 for a diagnostic algorithm of acid-base disorders. A net ↓ in either tubular H+ secretion or HCO3 reabsorption that leads to a non–anion gap metabolic acidosis. There are three main types of RTA; type IV (distal) is the most common form (see Table 2.16-2). An abrupt ↓ in renal function leading to the retention of creatinine and BUN. ↓ urine output (oliguria, defined as < 500 cc/day) is not required for ARF. ARF is categorized as follows (see also Table 2.16-3): Prerenal: ↓ renal perfusion. Intrinsic: Injury within the nephron unit. Postrenal: Urinary outﬂow obstruction. Generally, both kidneys must be obstructed before one can see a significant ↑ in BUN and creatinine. Alcoholics are the most common patient population with hypomagnesemia.
Document 9 (Title: The pharmacokinetics of perindopril and its effects on serum angiotensin converting enzyme activity in hypertensive patients with chronic renal failure.): 1. Perindopril, an orally active angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, was given to 23 hypertensive patients with stable chronic renal failure for 15 days. The dose of perindopril was 2 or 4 mg once a day according to the degree of renal failure. The creatinine clearance of the patients ranged from 6 to 67 ml min-1 1.73 m-2. The pharmacokinetics of perindopril and perindoprilat, its active metabolite, were studied after acute and chronic administration of perindopril. 2. The drug was well tolerated and creatinine clearance was unaltered by treatment. 3. In both groups, steady-state was reached within 3 days of chronic treatment. 4. After both acute and chronic drug administration renal impairment had no effect on perindopril pharmacokinetics but the pharmacokinetics of perindoprilat were altered significantly. After chronic administration the serum accumulation ratio was 1.81 in patients with mild renal failure and 5.35 in patients with severe renal failure. Chronic administration did not modify the renal clearance of perindoprilat nor its elimination half-life. 5. A significant correlation between the renal clearance of perindoprilat and creatinine clearance was observed (r = 0.87 first dose, r = 0.83 last chronic dose). 6. A non-linear relationship between serum perindoprilat concentration and inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme was described by a modified Hill equation. Values of IC50 were 1.11 +/- 0.07 micrograms I-1 (mean +/- s.d.) in patients with severe renal failure and 1.81 +/- 0.20 micrograms l-1 in patients with moderate renal failure. Chronic administration increased maximal inhibition and decreased the time to maximal inhibition only in patients with severe renal failure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Document 10 (Title: End-Stage Renal Disease -- Pathophysiology): Each nephron in a normal kidney contributes to the total glomerular filtration rate (GFR). The decline of kidney function is gradual and may initially present asymptomatically. The natural history of renal failure depends on the etiology of the disease but ultimately involves early homeostatic mechanisms involving hyperfiltration of the nephrons. The kidney maintains GFR, despite the progressive destruction of nephrons because the remaining normal nephrons develop hyperfiltration and compensatory hypertrophy. As a result, the patient with mild renal impairment can show normal creatinine values, and the disease can go undetected for some time. [24]
Document 11 (Title: Obstentrics_Williams): renal failure by a mean of 4 years (Cunningham, 1990). Similar indings in women with a median follow-up of 3 years were described by Imbasciati and coworkers (2007). By this time, end-stage disease was apparent in 30 percent of women whose serum creatinine was ::l.4 mg/dL and who had proteinuriaa> 1 g/d. Chronic proteinuria is also a marker for subsequent development of renal failure. In another report from Parkland Hospital, 20 percent of women with chronic proteinuria discovered during pregnancy progressed to end-stage renal failure within several years (Stettler, 1992).
Document 12 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): osteoclastic activity). The kidney becomes involved when the calcium × phosphate product in serum rises above the point at which ectopic calcification occurs (nephrocalcinosis) or when the calcium × oxalate (or phosphate) product in urine exceeds saturation, leading to nephrolithiasis. Subtle early indicators of such renal involvement include polyuria, nocturia, and hyposthenuria. Radiologic evidence of nephrocalcinosis and stones is not generally observed until later. The degree of the ensuing renal failure is best followed by monitoring the decline in creatinine clearance. On the other hand, chronic kidney disease can be a primary cause of bone disease because of altered handling of calcium and phosphate, decreased 1,25(OH)2D production, increased FGF23 levels, and secondary hyperparathyroidism.
Document 13 (Title: Contrast Agent Toxicity -- History and Physical): CIN may present as a transient elevation in serum creatinine with or without oliguria. The diagnosis cannot be officially made until a follow-up measurement showing decreasing creatinine is obtained within 2 to 3 days. However, there are several acknowledged risk factors in a patient history for CIN including chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, dehydration, diuretic use, advanced age, and concomitant exposure to other drugs or diseases that affect renal hemodynamics. The Roxana Mehran score predictor for CIN calculates patient risk based on the following elements in their history: Age (4 points if older than 75 years of age) Anemia (3 points) Diabetes (3 points) Congestive heart failure (5 points) Intra-aortic balloon pump (5 points) eGFR 60 to 40 (2 points) eGFR 40 to 20 (4 points) eGFR less than 20 (6 points) Hypotension requiring inotropic support (5 points) Contrast media volume (1 point per 100 mL)
Document 14 (Title: Renal function during erythropoietin therapy for anemia in predialysis chronic renal failure patients.): Recombinant human erythropoietin (r-HuEPO) therapy for anemia in chronic renal failure patients could have unfavorable renal effects since reversal of anemia can raise blood pressure and accelerate experimental glomerular injury. Thus, the effects of r-HuEPO on renal and systemic hemodynamics and the progression of renal disease were studied in predialysis chronic renal failure patients. The clearances of inulin and p-aminohippurate, fractional excretions of albumin and immunoglobulin G, cardiac output, plasma renin activity and aldosterone concentration were assessed at baseline, after short-term r-HuEPO (n = 4) or placebo (n = 4) therapy, and after long-term r-HuEPO for all patients (n = 8). In addition, the slope of l/serum creatinine with time was determined before and during continued r-HuEPO therapy. In contrast to placebo therapy, hematocrit increased with r-HuEPO from 32 to 37% after 7.6 +/- 2.7 weeks (mean +/- SD). Antihypertensive drug therapy was increased in 2 patients in each group. Renal function, cardiac output, plasma renin activity and aldosterone did not change significantly in either group. After 18 +/- 9 weeks of therapy for all patients, hematocrit increased from 31 to 39%. Antihypertensive drug therapy was increased in 5 patients and decreased in 1. Renal function decreased while proteinuria tended to increase. Cardiac output, plasma renin activity and aldosterone did not change. During 37 +/- 22 weeks of r-HuEPO therapy, the slope of l/serum creatinine did not worsen in any patient.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Document 15 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): When confronted with an abnormal urinalysis and elevated serum creatinine, with or without edema or congestive heart failure, one must consider whether the glomerulonephritis is acute or chronic. This assessment is best made by careful history (last known urinalysis or serum creatinine during pregnancy or insurance physical, evidence of infection, or use of medication or recreational drugs); the size of the kidneys on renal ultrasound examination; and how the patient feels at presentation. Chronic glomerular disease often presents with decreased kidney size. Patients who quickly develop renal failure are fatigued and weak and often have uremic symptoms associated with nausea, vomiting, fluid retention, and somnolence. Primary glomerulonephritis presenting with renal failure that has progressed slowly, however, can be remarkably asymptomatic, as are patients with acute glomerulonephritis without much loss in renal function. Once this initial information is collected, selected patients
