Document 1 (Title: Quinidine -- Administration -- Dosage Regimens): Oral immediate-release formulation: The initial therapy involves administering 2 tablets of 200 mg each every 6 hours to the patients. The dose may be cautiously increased if the desired pharmacological conversion is not achieved after 4 to 5 doses. Oral extended-release formulation: For the first treatment option, patients are administered 2 tablets of 324 mg each (equivalent to 403 mg of quinidine base) every 8 hours. If the desired pharmacological conversion is not achieved after 3 or 4 doses, the dose may be increased cautiously. As an alternative regimen, patients may have been prescribed 1 tablet (equivalent to 202 mg of quinidine base) every 8 hours for 2 days, followed by 2 tablets (equivalent to 403 mg of quinidine base) every 12 hours for 2 days, and, finally, 2 tablets (equivalent to 403 mg of quinidine base) every 8 hours for up to 4 days. For the final 4-day treatment plan, the lower dose may be opted at the physician's discretion.
Document 2 (Title: Pharmaceutical formulation): Sustained release There are a number of methods by which tablets and capsules can be modified in order to allow for sustained release of the active compound as it moves through the digestive tract. One of the most common methods is to embed the active ingredient in an insoluble porous matrix, such that the dissolving drug must make its way out of the matrix before it can be absorbed. In other sustained release formulations the matrix swells to form a gel through which the drug exits. Another method by which sustained release is achieved is through an osmotic controlled-release oral delivery system, where the active compound is encased in a water-permeable membrane with a laser drilled hole at one end. As water passes through the membrane the drug is pushed out through the hole and into the digestive tract where it can be absorbed. Parenteral formulations
Document 3 (Title: Dissolution of theophylline from film-coated slow release mini-tablets in various dissolution media.): The dissolution of an experimental formulation of film-coated slow release theophylline mini-tablets has been investigated using the USP paddle apparatus in test media at pH 1.2 (hydrochloric acid), pH 5.4 and 7.4 (phosphate buffers) at 37 degrees C. Monitoring of in-vitro theophylline release over 12 h, under identical hydrodynamic conditions, showed that the dissolution rate at pH 1.2 is substantially greater (95% of total drug content released in less than 10 h) than that in phosphate buffers. The maximum release after 12 h was approximately 20 and 30% of total drug content of the tablet at pH 5.4 and 7.4, respectively. However, in vivo bioavailability after oral administration of tablets to rabbits corresponded to over 95% of total drug, compared with the same dose administered intravenously. The retarded drug release during in-vitro dissolution in phosphate buffer was attributed to a possible interaction of phosphate ions with theophylline molecules at the tablet core-coat interface. These findings indicate that both rate and extent of theophylline release from the slow release coated mini-tablets are highly sensitive to phosphate buffers. The data also emphasize the usefulness of an animal model for assessment of in-vivo drug release and subsequent absorption, during the development of modified release dosage forms.
Document 4 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): in a sustained-release capsule that dissolves within the small intestine at a pH of 6. Lansoprazole is available in an orally disintegrating tablet that can be taken with or without water, an advantage for individuals who have significant dysphagia. Absorption kinetics are similar to the capsule. In addition, a lansoprazole-naproxen combination preparation that has been made available is targeted at decreasing NSAID-related GI injury (see below). Omeprazole is available as nonenteric-coated granules mixed with sodium bicarbonate in a powder form that can be administered orally or via gastric tube. The sodium bicarbonate has two purposes: to protect the omeprazole from acid degradation and to promote rapid gastric alkalinization and subsequent proton pump activation, which facilitates rapid action of the PPI. Pantoprazole and rabeprazole are available as enteric-coated tablets. Pantoprazole is also available as a parenteral formulation for intravenous use. These agents are lipophilic
Document 5 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): 2. Mesalamine compounds—Other proprietary formulations have been designed that package 5-ASA itself in various ways to deliver it to different segments of the small or large bowel. These 5-ASA formulations are known generically as mesalamine. Pentasa is a mesalamine formulation that contains timed-release microgranules that release 5-ASA throughout the small intestine (Figure 62–9). Asacol and Apriso have 5-ASA coated in a pH-sensitive resin that dissolves at pH 6–7 (the pH of the distal ileum and proximal colon). Lialda also uses a pH-dependent resin that encases a multimatrix core. On dissolution of the pH-sensitive resin in the colon, water slowly penetrates its hydrophilic and lipophilic core, leading to slow release of mesalamine throughout FIGURE 62–8 Chemical structures and metabolism of aminosalicylates. Azo compounds (balsalazide, olsalazine, sulfasalazine) are converted by bacterial azoreductase to 5-aminosalicylic acid (mesalamine), the active therapeutic moiety.
Document 6 (Title: [Development of press-coated tablets with controlled-release effect with a base of poly-d(-)-3-hydroxybutyric acid].): A new drug delivery system with controlled-release effect based on press-coated tablets using poly-D(-)-3-hydroxybutyric acid (Poly-HB) is presented. Model investigations show that the coating of a drug containing core with an indifferent matrix consisting of Poly-HB, a channeling agent (sodium chloride, potassium nitrate or lactose) and the initial dose of the drug leads to a zero-order release kinetics. The system is applicable for oral and parenteral dosage of various drugs.
Document 7 (Title: Dienogest): Dienogest 1 mg oral tablets (Dinagest) and 2 mg oral tablets (Valette) (not available in U.S.) – indicated for endometriosis Dienogest 2 mg and estradiol valerate 3 mg oral tablets (Natazia) (U.S.) – indicated for contraception and menorrhagia 2 dark yellow tablets each containing 3 mg estradiol valerate 5 medium red tablets each containing 2 mg estradiol valerate and 2 mg dienogest 17 light yellow tablets each containing 2 mg estradiol valerate and 3 mg dienogest 2 dark red tablets each containing 1 mg estradiol valerate 2 white tablets (inert) Dienogest 2 to 3 mg and estradiol valerate 1 to 3 mg oral tablets (Qlaira) (not available in U.S.) – indicated for contraception Each dark yellow active tablet contains 3 mg estradiol valerate Each medium red active tablet contains 2 mg estradiol valerate and 2 mg dienogest Each light yellow active tablet contains 2 mg estradiol valerate and 3 mg dienogest Each dark red active tablet contains 1 mg estradiol valerate
Document 8 (Title: Resinous glaze): Pharmaceutical glaze is used by the drug and nutritional supplement industry as a coating material for tablets and capsules. It serves to improve the product's appearance, extend shelf life and protect it from moisture, as well as provide a solid finishing film for pre-print coatings. It also serves to mask unpleasant odors and aid in the swallowing of the tablet. The shellac coating is insoluble in stomach acid and may make the tablet difficult for the body to break down or assimilate. For this reason, it can also be used as an ingredient in time-released, sustained or delayed-action pills. The product is listed on the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) inactive ingredient list.
Document 9 (Title: Hydromorphone -- Administration -- Available Dosage Forms): As observed previously, hydromorphone oral tablets are accessible in both immediate-release and extended-release formulations. The immediate-release oral solutions are provided in a dosage strength of 1 mg/1 mL, whereas oral tablets are available in strengths of 2 mg, 4 mg, and 8 mg. The extended-release oral tablets are available in dosages of 8 mg, 12 mg, 16 mg, and 32 mg. Notably, the 32 mg strength of the medication does not have an oral solution form. Injection solutions are available in concentrations of 1 mg/mL, 2 mg/mL, 4 mg/mL, and 10 mg/mL. Intravenous solutions are available in strengths of 2 mg/1 mL, 2500 mg/250 mL, 10 mg/1 mL, and 500 mg/50 mL. Suppositories are formulated at a strength of 3 mg.
Document 10 (Title: Sustained release of a model macromolecule from preparations with erodible core.): A series of sustained release tablets were prepared which consisted of a water-soluble core and a highly hydrophobic coat. Release of a macromolecule, Spectrum Orange, from this preparation was studied. It was found that release was controlled by the coat composition and coating solution viscosity. SEM and optical microscopy of the tablets indicated that the coats contained pores on the surface which penetrated in towards the centre of the core. It was deduced that the almost zero order release of macromolecules from these tablets was basically through these pores and not by diffusion through the polymer matrix.
Document 11 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Lialda is a once-a-day formulation of mesalamine (Multi-Matrix System [MMX]) designed to release mesalamine in the colon. The MMX technology incorporates mesalamine into a lipophilic matrix within a hydrophilic matrix encapsulated in a polymer resistant to degradation at a low pH (<7) to delay release throughout the colon. The safety profile appears to be comparable to other 5-ASA formulations. Apriso is a formulation containing encapsulated mesalamine granules that delivers mesalamine to the terminal ileum and colon via a proprietary extended-release mechanism (Intellicor). The outer coating (Eudragit L) dissolves at a pH >6. In addition, there is a polymer matrix core that aids in sustained release throughout the colon. Because Lialda and Apriso are given once daily, an anticipated benefit is improved compliance compared with two to four daily doses required for other mesalamine preparations.
Document 12 (Title: Clavulanic Acid -- Administration): Clavulanic acid alone has been shown to have no antibacterial effects, and administration must accompany amoxicillin. It is available in both solid and liquid forms. For the solid form, the patient must chew the chewable tablets before swallowing, and there are also immediate and extended-release tablets that must be swallowed whole. The oral liquid suspension should be shaken before administration and is the recommended formulation for children who are unable to chew tablets or swallow whole pills. Administration of all forms of the drug should be done at the start of a light meal to enhance oral absorption and avoid gastrointestinal irritation. Clavulanic acid may increase the absorption of amoxicillin. This drug regimen is to be administered twice to three times daily, depending on dosage, at regular time intervals to maintain constant serum concentrations. [5]
Document 13 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): It is apparent that many OTC medications are comparable products advertised to consumers in ways that suggest significant differences between them. For example, there are over 100 different systemic analgesic products, almost all of which contain aspirin, acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen, or a combination of these agents as primary ingredients. They are made different from one another by the addition of questionable ingredients such as caffeine or antihistamines; by brand names chosen to suggest a specific use or strength (eg, “women’s,” “migraine,” “arthritis,” “maximum”); or by special dosage formulations (eg, enteric-coated tablets, gel tabs, liquids, orally disintegrating strips and tablets, sustained-release products, powders, seltzers). Generally, a price is attached to all of these features, and in most cases, a less expensive generic product can be equally effective. It is probably safe to assume that the public is generally
Document 14 (Title: Nitrates -- Administration): Other forms of commonly used nitrates include isosorbide dinitrate, isosorbide mononitrate, and isosorbide mononitrate sustained-release (SR). These forms are taken orally and have a longer duration of action. However, due to hepatic metabolism, the oral forms require relatively larger doses. [3] [7] Below are commonly prepared forms of nitrates [3] [4] [8] : Nitroglycerin Sublingual tablet – 0.3 to 0.6 mg, up to 1.5 mg as needed a day Transdermal patch – 0.2 – 0.8 mg/h, one patch a day (remove at night for 12h) Ointment – 7.5 – 40 mg a day Capsule – 5 – 6.5 mg, 3 to 4 times a day Spray – 0.4 to 0.8 mg, 1 to 3 times a day; max 3 actuations in 15 minutes IV – range from 10 to 120 micrograms/min Isosorbide dinitrate Tablet – 10 to 40 mg 3 times a day Sublingual tablet – 2.5 to 10 mg Spray – 1.25 mg per dose Isosorbide mononitrate Tablet – 20 mg twice daily, 7 hours apart Tablet (Sustained release) – 30 to 120 daily; max daily dose 240 mg daily
Document 15 (Title: [On the development of oral preparations of the combination sulfamoxole/trimethoprim (CN 3123) (author's transl)].): Within the broad range of activities in pharmaceutical research, the technological development and analytical evaluation of a new drug formulation represent only one step. The pharmaceutical development of three oral formulations of a combination product containing N1-(4,5-dimethyl-2-oxazolyl)-sulfanilamide (sulfamoxole) and 2,4-diamino-5-(3,4,5-trimethoxy-benzyl)-pyrimidine (trimethoprim) in a 5:1 ratio (investigational drug CN 3123; Nevin; Supristol), which was based on the physico-chemical characteristics of the 2 active substances, is presented. The various chemical and physical tests conducted with the drug formulations are described. The pharmaceutical or in-vitro availabilities (dissolution rate) of the active ingredients were determined by way of release-rate profiles, both of the active ingredients alone and in their final formulations. Also presented are the results of plasma level determinations following oral administration of film-coated tablets and a suspension. Finally, preliminary results of extensive stability tests with the three drug formulations are discussed.
