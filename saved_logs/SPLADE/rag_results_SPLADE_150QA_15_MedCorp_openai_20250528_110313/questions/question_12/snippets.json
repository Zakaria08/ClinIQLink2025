This rare disease can be marked by a unique triad of symptoms: proximal muscle weakness, autonomic dysfunction, and areflexia. Proximal muscle weakness is a product of pathogenic autoantibodies directed against P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channels, which in turn leads to a reduction of acetylcholine release from motor nerve terminals on the presynaptic cell. Examples of autonomic dysfunction caused by LEMS include erectile dysfunction in men, constipation, and, most commonly, dry mouth. Less common dysfunctions include dry eyes and altered perspiration. Areflexia is a condition in which tendon reflexes are reduced and it may subside temporarily after a period of exercise.",

        "content": "The mute or nearly mute patient who is alert and has good understanding of speech and a right hemiparesis could have Broca's aphasia, akinesia of speech (transcortical motor aphasia), or aphemia. The patient who has Broca's aphasia does not write well, and his speech does not improve greatly with repetition. The speech of a patient with akinesia of speech improves with repetition. The aphemic patient writes normally, but his speech does not improve with repetition. The mute patient whose eyes are open but who is poorly responsive and moves little or not at all could be an akinetic mute (with either a cingulate or a thalamomesencephalic lesion) or have a locked-in syndrome. The latter is diagnosed by asking the patient to look up and down or to open and close his eyes. If he obeys these commands, the physician questions him using a code of eye movement responses. If the patient fails to respond at all, he is an akinetic mute; intense stimulation may result in speech or movement. If the patient is drowsy and has third nerve involvement, the lesion is in the thalamomesencephalic reticular formation. If the patient appears alert and has episodes of agitation, he probably has bilateral lesions in the gyri cinguli. Patients with weakness of the bulbar musculature (facial, palatal, and tongue weakness and dysphonia) may have either upper motor neuron or lower motor neuron lesions. Only bilateral upper motor neuron lesions produce permanent dysarthria. As a typical example, a patient has a transient left hemiparesis with dysarthria and almost completely recovers. Later, however, a right hemiparesis develops and the patient experiences severe bilateral facial weakness, drooling, dysphagia, and severe dysarthria. The absence of atrophy of the bulbar musculature, a hyperactive jaw jerk and gag reflex and, sometimes, inappropriate laughing or crying episodes indicate that the lesion is located above the medulla in the corticobulbar tracts. Flaccid paralysis, absence of the jaw jerk or gag reflex, and absence of other upper motor neuron signs, such as upgoing toes, indicate a lower motor neuron or neuromuscular junction problem. Appropriate tests to rule out myasthenia gravis should be done. The other conditions discussed here are often obvious from their clinical presentation. Although the specific disorder of speech sometimes is helpful in localizing the cause, in most patients, the associated deficits on neurologic examination are of greatest value.",

His thymoma was found in July 1988, and in October 1988, he was admitted to our hospital for treatment. Neurological examination showed muscular weakness, muscular atrophy, fasciculation, and distal dominant sensory disturbance of his right upper extremity and his bilateral lower extremities. The immunological examination showed an increase in serum IgG, gamma-globulin, OKT3 and OKT4 lymphocytes. Electromyographic studies showed severe waxing by repeated stimulations (200% by 10 Hz; 330% by 20 Hz), very low M wave amplitude by single stimulation, and post-tetanic exhaustion. An Eaton-Lambert-type neuromuscular transmission block was thus thought to exist. Concentric needle electromyography showed a neurogenic pattern. The sensory and motor nerve conduction velocity was delayed. Microscopic examination of biopsied skeletal muscle showed neurogenic change. A sural nerve biopsy specimen showed a decrease in the number of myelinated fibers (fiber density 4333/mm2), segmental demyelination, remyelination, and mild axonal change. Thymectomy was performed and pathological examination showed invasive thymoma of predominantly the epithelial type. His muscular weakness and sensory disturbance improved gradually after thymectomy. On the postoperative immunological examination, serum IgG, gamma-globulin, OKT3 and OKT4 lymphocytes were normalized. On the other hand, OKT8 lymphocytes were increased and the OKT4 to OKT8 ratio was decreased. The electromyographic studies showed no waxing, normal M wave amplitude, and no post-tetanic exhaustion.

An Eaton-Lambert-type neuromuscular transmission block was thus thought to exist. Concentric needle electromyography showed a neurogenic pattern. The sensory and motor nerve conduction velocity was delayed. Microscopic examination of biopsied skeletal muscle showed neurogenic change. A sural nerve biopsy specimen showed a decrease in the number of myelinated fibers (fiber density 4333/mm2), segmental demyelination, remyelination, and mild axonal change. Thymectomy was performed and pathological examination showed invasive thymoma of predominantly the epithelial type. His muscular weakness and sensory disturbance improved gradually after thymectomy. On the postoperative immunological examination, serum IgG, gamma-globulin, OKT3 and OKT4 lymphocytes were normalized. On the other hand, OKT8 lymphocytes were increased and the OKT4 to OKT8 ratio was decreased. The electromyographic studies showed no waxing, normal M wave amplitude, and no post-tetanic exhaustion. Therefore, we consider that an Eaton-Lambert-type neuromuscular transmission block and sensorimotor neuropathy in this case were caused by the immunological abnormality accompanying malignant thymoma.",

Here, the antibodies inhibit the release of neurotransmitters, resulting in muscle weakness and autonomic dysfunctions. Nerve conduction studies performed on the Ulnar motor and sensory, Median motor and sensory, Tibial motor, and Peroneal motor nerves in patients with LEMS have shown that the conduction velocity across these nerves is actually normal. However, the amplitudes of the compound motor action potentials may be reduced by up to 55%, and the duration of these action potentials decreased by up to 47%.",

        "content": "An atypical case of hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy of neuronal type with retardation of motor development was described. The patient was a 15-year-old boy who had suffered from distal muscle weakness with atrophy of four limbs and deformities of hands and feet since age 6 months. These symptoms were slowly progressive. He had never walked. His parents were not consanguinous. His parents and two siblings were unremarkable on neurological examination and on nerve conduction studies. On neurological examination, he showed severe degree of muscle weakness and atrophy in the distal upper and lower limbs, moderate degree of muscle weakness and atrophy in the proximal upper limbs and slight degree of made weakness and atrophy in the proximal upper limbs. Deep tendon reflexes in four limbs were decreased or absent. Vibration sensation was moderately decreased in the distal parts of four limbs. On the nerve conduction studies, no sensory nerve potential was recorded in the median, ulnar and sural nerves bilaterally. Motor nerve conduction velocity of the right tibial nerve was 21 m/sec and the amplitude of the compound muscle action potential (M-wave) was 0.15 mV, and no M-wave was elicited with the electrical stimulation of the median, ulnar and peroneal nerves. Neelde EMG showed fibrillation potentials and giant spikes with a reduction of the number of motor units. On sural nerve biopsy, the densities of both myelinated and unmyelinated fibers were severely decreased.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
