Document 1 (Title: A novel endoscopic transgastric fundoplication procedure for gastroesophageal reflux: an initial animal evaluation.): Complications of gastroesophageal reflux are common in adults and children. A variety of surgical procedures have been successfully used to treat this condition. All current techniques require open surgery and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality, particularly in the high risk, neurologically damaged child. The authors have developed a novel method of creating a gastric fundoplication using an endoscopic transgastric approach in pigs. The procedure involves the creation of an esophageal intussusception into the stomach under direct vision with an endoscope. The gastric fundus is then plicated around the esophagus using a custom stapling device. The transgastric approach allows creation of a fundoplication, is easily performed, is potentially effective at preventing gastroesophageal reflux, and has the obvious advantages of minimally invasive surgery over open techniques of fundoplication.
Document 2 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): barriers to expansion. To date, the most headline-grabbing procedures have been the transvaginal and transgastric removal of the gallbladder84-86 (Fig. 14-25). To ensure safety, all human cases thus far have involved laparoscopic assistance to aid in retrac-tion and ensure adequate closure of the stomach or vagina. To date, thousands of transvaginal and transgastric procedures have been performed internationally, with two large registries dem-onstrating noninferiority to conventional laparoscopy.87 The fact that the vast majority of these procedures are being done trans-vaginally creates an obvious limitation in applicability.The rapid growth of endoscopic technology catalyzed by NOTES has already spun off new technologies capable of performing a wide variety of endoscopic surgical procedures from EMR, to ablation of Barrett’s esophagus, to creation of competent antireflux valves in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease.Peroral esophageal myotomy (POEM) has shown promise as a
Document 3 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): fibers into bundles, one for illu-mination and one for imaging. The earliest upper endoscopes revolutionized the diagnosis and treatment of gastroesophageal reflux and peptic ulcer disease and made possible early detec-tion of upper and lower gastrointestinal (GI) cancer at a stage that could be cured. The first endoscopic surgical procedure was the colonoscopic polypectomy, developed by Shinya and Wolfe, two surgeons from New York City. The percutane-ous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) invented by Gauderer and Ponsky may have been the first NOTES procedure, reported in 1981.5 Endoscopic pancreatic pseudocyst drainage is thought to be the next NOTES procedure developed; however, there was little energy and money put into the development of NOTES until a number of gastroenterologists claimed the ability to remove the gallbladder with a flexible endoscope, using a transgastric technique. With this pronouncement, the surgical community took notice and seized the momentum for NOTES

Document 5 (Title: Neuroanatomy, Inferior Colliculus -- Surgical Considerations): Another surgery in this area is the placement of an IC implant, which works similarly to a cochlear implant but is utilized in those with cochlear nerve damage. These implants may be used especially for those with neurofibromatosis-2 whose cochlear nerves suffer damage upon removal of schwannomas of CN VIII. A trans-labyrinthine or retrosigmoid approach with possible endoscopic aid may be the best approach to the area surgically, and brainstem auditory evoked potentials (discussed below) can be monitored during surgery to avoid damage to auditory pathways.

Document 6 (Title: Portal Vein Obstruction -- Treatment / Management -- Surgical Procedures): The role of shunt surgery is debatable and most experts recommend endoscopic treatment and propranolol in patients with recurrent bleeding. If shunt surgery is undertaken, a distal splenorenal shunt is recommended. If the splenic vein is thrombosed, splenectomy at the time of shunt surgery is an option. If patients have cirrhosis, the mortality of shunt surgery is extremely high. One should keep in mind the possibility of liver nodules forming in patients undergoing shunt procedures. Such nodules are known to present in patients with congenital portosystemic shunts without liver disease. [22] A liver transplant is an option for less than 5% of patients. Five-year survival rates of 60% have been reported but surgery is also associated with numerous complications.
Document 7 (Title: Immune thrombocytopenic purpura): Surgery Splenectomy (removal of the spleen) may be considered in patients who are either unresponsive to steroid treatment, have frequent relapses, or cannot be tapered off steroids after a few months. Platelets which have been bound by antibodies are taken up by macrophages in the spleen (which have Fc receptors), and so removal of the spleen reduces platelet destruction. The procedure is potentially risky in ITP cases due to the increased possibility of significant bleeding during surgery. Durable remission following splenectomy is achieved in 60 - 80 percent of ITP cases. Even though there is a consensus regarding the short-term efficacy of splenectomy, findings on its long-term efficacy and side-effects are controversial. After splenectomy, 11.6 - 75 percent of ITP cases relapsed, and 8.7 - 40 percent of ITP cases had no response to splenectomy. The use of splenectomy to treat ITP has diminished since the development of steroid therapy and other pharmaceutical remedies.
Document 8 (Title: Intraabominal Abscesses -- Treatment / Management): The approach to abscess treatment varies by anatomic location. While a subdiaphragmatic abscess can be drained percutaneously, a pelvic abscess is accessed transrectally or transvaginally. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided drainage provides a safe and effective minimally invasive treatment option. [69] [70] Transesophageal and transgastric approaches have been used for a subphrenic abscess. [71] Splenic abscesses have been traditionally treated with splenectomy, but percutaneous drainage has been correlated with lower mortality and complication rates. [72] Results from a study showed that abscess size, age, inflammatory markers, leukocytosis, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were predictive of the need for surgical intervention due to failure of pharmacologic treatment. [73]
Document 9 (Title: Cholecystectomy): Natural orifice transluminal Natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) is an experimental technique where the laparoscope is inserted through natural orifices and internal incisions, rather than skin incisions, to access to the abdominal cavity. This offers the potential to eliminate visible scars. Since 2007, cholecystectomy by NOTES has been performed anecdotally via transgastric and transvaginal routes. As of 2009 the risk of gastrointestinal leak, difficulty visualizing the abdominal cavity and other technical limitations limited further adoption of NOTES for cholecystectomy.
Document 10 (Title: Surgery in Barrett's oesophagus.): Surgical treatment for a columnar-lined oesophagus (CLO) may be considered in terms of indications, procedures and risks. Reflux may be an indication for surgery, but does not lead to reversal of epithelium, nor does it eliminate malignant potential. Whether it reduces such potential is not certain. Anti-reflux surgery is therefore based on reflux-related criteria, and not as a treatment for a CLO. Dysplasia is a possible indication for surgery, but as progression to carcinoma may be slow, must not be considered an absolute indication in an elderly, frail patient. Malignancy is a clear indication for operation in a patient deemed fit enough to withstand it. Anti-reflux operations have been standardized over recent years, and aim at exclusion of gastric juice from the oesophagus. Another approach is to alter refluxed material qualitatively by a duodenal diversion procedure. This eliminates bile and pancreatic juice from the oesophagus, with dramatic effects on inflammation but without reversal of a CLO. Reversal of inflammation may facilitate endoscopic surveillance. Either dysplasia or carcinoma are treated by oesophagogastric resection. Newer forms of laparoscopic or thoracoscopic dissection may be particularly applicable with dysplasia or early carcinoma in CLO. Palliative surgery for advanced tumours is not often required today. Risks of anti-reflux surgery must be balanced against symptoms. Risks are reduced if splenectomy is avoided, and operations avoided where possible in the elderly. Resection for dysplasia or carcinoma is high-risk surgery. In the young there is much to gain, and the risks are lower. In the elderly, in the absence of other treatment, risks must be balanced against general health and life expectancy.
Document 11 (Title: [Transgastric lymphadenography].): The transgastric lymphadenography technique carried out by the endoscopic route in 52 patients at the Digestive Endoscopy Centre of the 3rd Surgical Clinic of Rome University is described. On the basis of personal results it is considered that transgastric lymphadenography represents an interesting technique for the study of perigastric lymphnodes in normal and pathologic conditions. It is thought that it could also be useful in the study of the abdominal lymphatics although further verification and a larger series are necessary.
Document 12 (Title: Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome): Otherwise WAS treatment is focused on managing symptoms and preventing complications. The greatest mortality risk in WAS before age 30 is from bleeding so aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs that may interfere with already compromised platelet function should generally be avoided. Circumcision, as well as elective surgeries, should generally be deferred in males with thrombocytopenia until after HCT if possible. Protective helmets can help protect children from life-threatening intracranial hemorrhage (brain bleed) which could result from head injuries. Patients may require platelet transfusions when there is extreme bloodloss (such as during surgery) or for very low platelets splenectomy (removal of the spleen) may also be lifesaving. However, splenectomy is generally considered palliative and is not universally recommended in WAS because it can increase the risk of life-threatening infections. Post-splenectomy patients will require lifelong antibiotic
Document 13 (Title: Thyroid Eye Disease -- Treatment / Management -- Surgical Management): Medial wall decompression - using trans-cutaneous, trans-conjunctival, or trans-nasal approaches. The transnasal endoscopic approach is ideal for medial wall surgeries. [63]
Document 14 (Title: Splenectomy): Procedure Laparoscopy is the preferred procedure in cases where the spleen is not too large and when the procedure is elective. Open surgery is performed in trauma cases or if the spleen is enlarged. Either method is major surgery and is performed under general anesthesia. Vaccination for S. pneumoniae, H. influenza and N. meningitidis should be given pre-operatively if possible to minimize the chance of overwhelming post-splenectomy infection (OPSI), a rapid-developing and highly fatal type of septicaemia. The spleen is located and disconnected from its arteries. The ligaments holding the spleen in place, gastrosplenic ligament, splenorenal ligament and splenocolic ligament, are dissected and the organ is removed. In some cases, one or more accessory spleens are discovered and also removed during surgery. The incisions are closed and when indicated, a drain is left. If necessary, tissue samples are sent to a laboratory for analysis.
Document 15 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): replaced open surgery for this condition. Lastly, self-expanding plastic stents have been developed as temporary devices to be used in the GI tract to close internal fistulas and bridge leaking anastomoses.Natural Orifice Transluminal Endoscopic SurgeryThe use of the flexible endoscope to enter the GI, urinary, or reproductive tracts and then traverse the wall of the structure to enter the peritoneal cavity, the mediastinum, or the chest has strong appeal to patients wishing to avoid scars and pain caused by abdominal wall trauma. In truth, transluminal surgery has been performed in the stomach for a long time, either from the inside out (e.g., percutaneous, PEG, and transgastric pseudocyst drainage) or from the outside in (e.g., laparoscopic-assisted intragastric tumor resection). The catalyz-ing events for NOTES were the demonstration that a porcine gallbladder could be removed with a flexible endoscope passed through the wall of the stomach and then removed through the mouth and
