This makes it particularly susceptible to impairment from a variety of disorders and conditions. Schizophrenia There is significant evidence that smooth pursuit is deficient in people with schizophrenia and their relatives. People with schizophrenia tend to have trouble pursuing very fast targets. This impairment is correlated with less activation in areas known to play a role in pursuit, such as the frontal eye field. However, other studies have shown that people with schizophrenia show relatively normal pursuit, compared to controls, when tracking objects that move unexpectedly. The greatest deficits are when the patients track objects of a predictable velocity which begin moving at a predictable time.

        "content": "1. We have investigated the mechanism of a directional deficit in vertical pursuit eye movements in a monkey that was unable to match upward eye speed to target speed but that had pursuit within the normal range for downward or horizontal target motion. Except for a difference in the axis of deficient pursuit, the symptoms in this monkey were similar to those seen with lesions in the frontal or parietal lobes of the cerebral cortex in humans or monkeys. Our evaluation of vertical pursuit in this monkey suggests a new interpretation for the role of the frontal and parietal lobes in pursuit. 2. The up/down asymmetry was most pronounced for target motion at speeds greater than or equal to 2 degree/s. For target motion at 15 or 30 degree/s, upward step-ramp target motion evoked a brief upward smooth eye acceleration, followed by tracking that consisted largely of saccades. Downward step-ramp target motion evoked a prolonged smooth eye acceleration, followed by smooth, accurate tracking. 3. Varying the amplitude of the target step revealed that the deficit was similar for targets moving across all locations of the visual field. Eye acceleration in the interval 0-20 ms after the onset of pursuit was independent of initial target position and was symmetrical for upward and downward target motion. Eye acceleration in the interval 60-80 ms after the onset of pursuit showed a large asymmetry. For upward target motion, eye acceleration in this interval was small and did not depend on initial target position. For downward target motion, eye acceleration depended strongly on initial target position and was large when the target started close to the position of fixation. 4. We next attempted to understand the mechanism of the up/down asymmetry by evaluating the monkey's vertical motion processing and vertical eye movements under a variety of tracking conditions. For spot targets, the response to upward image motion was similar to that in normal monkeys if the image motion was presented during downward pursuit. In addition, the monkey with deficient upward pursuit was able to use upward image motion to make accurate saccades to moving targets. We conclude that the visual processing of upward image motion was normal in this monkey and that an asymmetry in visual motion processing could not account for the deficit in his upward pursuit. 5. Upward smooth eye acceleration was normal when the spot target was moved together with a large textured pattern.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

        "content": "When a person walks through a rigid environment while holding eyes and head fixed, the pattern of retinal motion flows radially away from a point, the focus of expansion (Fig. 1a). Under such conditions of translation, heading corresponds to the focus of expansion and people identify it readily. But when making an eye/head movement to track an object off to the side, retinal motion is no longer radial (Fig. 1b). Heading perception in such situations has been modelled in two ways. Extra-retinal models monitor the velocity of rotational movements through proprioceptive or efference information from the extraocular and neck muscles and use that information to discount rotation effects. Retinal-image models determine (and eliminate) rotational components from the retinal image alone. These models have been tested by measuring heading perception under two conditions. First, observers judged heading while tracking a point on a simulated ground plane. Second, they fixated a stationary point and the flow field simulated the effects of a tracking eye movement. Extra-retinal models predict poorer performance in the simulated condition because the eyes do not move. Retinal-image models predict no difference in performance because the two conditions produce identical patterns of retinal motion. Warren and Hannon observed similar performance and concluded that people do not require extra-retinal information to judge heading with eye/head movements present, but they used extremely slow tracking eye movements of 0.2-1.2 deg s-1; a moving observer frequently tracks objects at much higher rates (L. Stark, personal communication). Here we examine heading judgements at higher, more typical eye movement velocities and find that people require extra-retinal information about eye position to perceive heading accurately under many viewing conditions.",

With large stimuli the alternation is piecemeal, whilst when small stimuli are used the whole pattern alternates in unison. The purpose of this study was to determine whether a reliable, objective indicator of the perceptual state during binocular rivalry could be developed in the nonhuman primate. Monkeys (Macaca mulatta) were trained to discriminate direction of motion when presented with vertically drifting gratings moving in opposite directions in the two eyes. A high correlation was found between the direction of the slow phase of the optokinetic nystagmus (OKN) elicited by the drifting gratings during rivalry and the direction of motion reported by the monkey even though the gain of the OKN was reduced during rivalry, and the latency was longer. Behavioral eye dominance during rivalry varied significantly over time, between individuals and as a function of interocular contrast differences. Since the direction of tracking eye movements can be used to reliably monitor perceptual state during binocular motion rivalry, the opportunity exists in nonhuman primates to study the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying motion perception during the perceptually ambiguous condition of binocular rivalry.",

Brain volume reductions with age are more pronounced in individuals with schizophrenia than in healthy individuals. Finally, indi- viduals with schizophrenia appear to differ from individuals without the disorder in eye- tracking and electrophysiological indices. Neurological soft signs common in individuals with schizophrenia include impairments in motor coordination, sensory integration, and motor sequencing of complex movements; left-right confusion; and disinhibition of associated movements. In addition, minor phys- ical anomalies of the face and limbs may occur.",

Reduced overall brain volume has been observed, as well as increased brain volume reduction with age.
