Document 1 (Title: Papillary thyroid cancer): Arguments for total thyroidectomy are: Reduced risk of recurrence, if central compartment nodes are removed at the original surgery. 30-85% of papillary carcinoma is multifocal disease. Hemithyroidectomy may leave disease in the other lobe. However, multifocal disease in the remnant lobe may not necessarily become clinically significant or serve as a detriment to patient survival. Ease of monitoring with thyroglobulin (sensitivity for picking up recurrence is increased in presence of total thyroidectomy, and ablation of the remnant normal thyroid by low dose radioiodine 131 after following a low iodine diet (LID). Ease of detection of metastatic disease by thyroid and neck node ultrasound. Post-operative complications at high-volume thyroid surgery centers with experienced surgeons are comparable to that of hemithyroidectomy. Arguments for hemithyroidectomy:
Document 2 (Title: Anatomy, Head and Neck, Thyroid Muscles -- Surgical Considerations): The thyroid muscles and surrounding vasculature are essential to consider during surgery in the neck region. The infrahyoid muscles may require incision during thyroid surgery to increase exposure to the thyroid gland. There has been some evidence to show that injury to the infrahyoid muscles during thyroid surgery may impact patients’ voices. The primary finding regarding this injury is that patients’ ability to reach high pitches decreased postoperatively. Additionally, when dissecting the superior pole of the thyroid, it is important not to perform high ligation of the superior thyroid artery. The reason behind this is that the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve is in the vicinity and can be injured. Thus, the patient will present with dysphonia if the nerve has suffered an injury. [8]
Document 3 (Title: Thyroidectomy -- Technique or Treatment): Superior pole dissection: The thyroid lobe is gently retracted anteromedially to expose the superior thyroid artery and vein. The avascular plane between the superior pole vessels laterally and the cricothyroid muscle medially is carefully developed using blunt dissection, working from an inferior to superior direction. This process creates a dissection window just below the superior thyroid vessels. Keeping dissection close to the thyroid capsule helps reduce the risk of damaging the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve. The superior thyroid vessels are then secured with ligatures, surgical clips, or energy devices, and the surrounding loose areolar tissue is divided once these vessels are ligated. Precision during this step is essential to avoid injuring the superior parathyroid glands. By ligating the superior pole vessels, the thyroid lobe can be elevated and rotated medially, which aids in exposing the tracheoesophageal groove and the area of the recurrent laryngeal nerve.
Document 4 (Title: First_Aid_Step1): Thyroid cancer Typically diagnosed with fine needle aspiration; treated with thyroidectomy. Complications of surgery include hypocalcemia (due to removal of parathyroid glands), transection of recurrent laryngeal nerve during ligation of inferior thyroid artery (leads to dysphagia and dysphonia [hoarseness]), and injury to the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve during ligation of superior thyroid vascular pedicle (may lead to loss of tenor usually noticeable in professional voice users). Papillary carcinoma Most common, excellent prognosis. Empty-appearing nuclei with central clearing (“Orphan Annie” eyes) A , psamMoma bodies, nuclear grooves (Papi and Moma adopted OrphanAnnie).  risk with RET/PTC rearrangements and BRAF mutations, childhood irradiation. Papillary carcinoma: most Prevalent, Palpable lymph nodes. Good prognosis.
Document 5 (Title: [Preservation of the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve in thyroid surgery. An anatomic study of 30 dissections].): The authors stress the importance of the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve in laryngeal physiology, by noting the consequences of its section during thyroid surgery. A rigorous anatomical study carried out on 15 fresh cadavers, i.e. 30 superior laryngeal nerves, reproducing the conditions of thyroid surgery, allowed precision of the time during surgery when the external branch is at risk of being damaged, especially during sectioning of the vascular pedicle of the upper pole and at the time of separation of the thyroid pole from the laryngeal axis. The study considers the anatomical variations of the territory of the superior thyroid artery and the various technical problems that are posed in preserving the external branch of the nerve. In the light of their findings, the authors advise that this nerve axis should be identified before ligature of the upper thyroid pedicle; if the advice is not followed then the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve may be damaged or sectioned in approximately 15% of cases.
Document 6 (Title: Thyroidectomy): Hemithyroidectomy — Entire isthmus is removed along with 1 lobe. Done in benign diseases of only 1 lobe. Subtotal thyroidectomy — Removal of majority of both lobes leaving behind 4-5 grams (equivalent to the size of a normal thyroid gland) of thyroid tissue on one or both sides—this used to be the most common operation for multinodular goitre. Partial thyroidectomy —Removal of gland in front of trachea after mobilization. Done in nontoxic MNG. Its role is controversial. Near total thyroidectomy — Both lobes are removed except for a small amount of thyroid tissue (on one or both sides) in the vicinity of the recurrent laryngeal nerve entry point and the superior parathyroid gland. Total thyroidectomy — Entire gland is removed. Done in cases of papillary or follicular carcinoma of thyroid, medullary carcinoma of thyroid. This is now also the most common operation for multinodular goitre.
Document 7 (Title: Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma: risk factors and outcome.): Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma, in contrast to well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma, has a dismal prognosis, and little progress has been made in improving survival for this disease. We reviewed our experience during a 23-year period to identify risk factors and possible methods to improve outcome. Between 1966 and 1989, 340 patients with thyroid carcinoma underwent operation. Of these, 17 (5%) were undergoing operative treatment of anaplastic or undifferentiated thyroid carcinoma. The female/male ratio was 3.5:1, and mean age at presentation was 63 years. The most common presenting symptoms included neck mass, voice change, or dysphagia. Unusual presentations included symptomatic bradycardia from compression of the vagus nerve and superior vena cava syndrome. Four patients had a history of well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma. Nine patients had been diagnosed or treated in the past for "goiter" or a neck mass, and four patients had concurrent differentiated thyroid carcinoma associated with the anaplastic tumor. Thus 13 (76%) of 17 patients had a previous thyroid disorder, benign or differentiated malignant, and eight (47%) of 17 patients had previous or concurrent differentiated thyroid carcinoma. At the time of presentation, six patients had unilateral true vocal cord paralysis. At operation, 14 patients had local extension of the tumor and four required tracheostomy. Only five of 12 patients showed response to postoperative radiation therapy. Overall median survival was 12 months, and 13 (76%) of 17 patients died. The two patients alive longer than 12 months had only small foci of anaplastic carcinoma in association with well-differentiated carcinoma. Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma is a locally and systemically aggressive disease, with long-term survival seen only in those with well-localized anaplastic tumor. The major risk factor in this series is a history of previous benign or malignant thyroid disease. Because of this, a more aggressive approach to thyroid masses may be warranted. Long-standing goiters or benign nodules should be followed carefully and considered for resection if they grow or do not respond to medical therapy, and total thyroidectomy for malignant disease may obviate the subsequent development of anaplastic carcinoma. This method of early diagnosis and resection of abnormal thyroid tissue seems to be the only method currently available to improve the nearly uniform fatality of this disease.
Document 8 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): resected en bloc with the thyroid gland. The sternothyroid muscle is then dissected off the underlying thyroid by a combination of sharp and blunt dissection, thus exposing the middle thyroid veins. The thyroid lobe is retracted medially and anteriorly, and the lateral tissues are swept posterolaterally using a peanut sponge. The middle thyroid veins are ligated and divided (Fig. 38-22C). Attention is then turned to the midline where Delphian nodes and the pyramidal lobe are identified. The fascia just cephalad and caudad to the isthmus is divided. The superior thyroid pole is identified by retracting the thyroid first inferiorly and medially, and then the upper pole of the thy-roid is mobilized caudally and laterally. The dissection plane is kept as close to the thyroid as possible, and the superior pole vessels are individually identified, skeletonized, ligated, and divided low on the thyroid gland to avoid injury to the exter-nal branch of the superior laryngeal nerve (Fig.
Document 9 (Title: Anatomy, Head and Neck, Neck Triangle -- Surgical Considerations -- Anterior Triangle): Thyroid and parathyroid surgery also require dissection of the anterior triangle as these structures lie within the pretracheal layer of the deep cervical fascia. The strap muscles must be delicately retracted or divided using electrocautery to visualize the thyroid gland adequately. The neurovascular structures of the thyroid and parathyroid glands are deep to the strap muscles. The surgeon must pay particular attention to the superior laryngeal artery and nerve near the superior pole of the thyroid. The superior thyroid artery must be ligated distal to the branch point of the superior laryngeal artery; otherwise, the vascular supply of the larynx could become compromised. Though not as severe as recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, injury to the superior laryngeal nerve may result in mild voice changes such as hoarseness or voice fatigue. [11] Bilateral superior laryngeal nerve injury, however, results in the loss of the laryngeal cough reflex, specifically due to the disruption of the internal laryngeal nerve. This condition places the patient at risk for aspiration pneumonia and other chronic problems. [20]
Document 10 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): and the superior pole vessels are individually identified, skeletonized, ligated, and divided low on the thyroid gland to avoid injury to the exter-nal branch of the superior laryngeal nerve (Fig. 38-22D). Once these vessels are divided, the tissues posterior and lateral to the superior pole can be swept from the gland in a posteromedial direction, to reduce the risk of damaging vessels supplying the upper parathyroid.The RLNs should then be identified, and the ATA 2015 guidelines strongly recommend visual identification in all cases.40 The course of the right RLN is more oblique than the left RLN. The nerves can be most consistently identified at the level of the cricoid cartilage. The parathyroids usually can be identified within 1 cm of the crossing of the inferior thyroid artery and the RLN, although they also may be ectopic in loca-tion. The lower pole of the thyroid gland should be mobilized by gently sweeping all tissues dorsally. The inferior thyroid vessels are dissected,
Document 11 (Title: Thyroid carcinoma. A report of 206 cases from an area with endemic goitre.): A retrospective analysis of 206 cases of thyroid carcinoma treated at a single surgical service in a region with endemic goitre is presented. In contrast to the marked female preponderance in surgically treated benign thyroid disorders, the frequency of thyroid carcinoma was almost equal in the two sexes (males/females = 100/106). The duration of symptoms was, as a rule, short and there was a predominance of advanced lesions (T3N3M1) even among the well-differentiated tumours. Papillary carcinoma was the most common histologic type (45%) but its proportion was considerably lower than usually reported from non-endemic regions. The average TSH level was significantly elevated in the carcinoma group and associated adenomatous changes were found in 40/100 cases which might suggest an etiologic role of increased TSH stimulation. Since most thyroid carcinomas had a very malignant clinical behaviour, surgical treatment aimed at near-total thyroidectomy which was performed in 62% of the cases. During a follow-up of up to eleven years recurrence in the remaining contralateral lobe occurred in 23% of patients with hemithyroidectomy and loco-regional recurrence was seen in 29% of patients with near-total thyroidectomy. Mortality was high in all histologic types, further underlining the aggressive biologic behaviour of thyroid cancers in an endemic area.
Document 12 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): thyroid vessels (Fig. 38-4). The type 2a variant, in which the nerve crosses below the tip of the thyroid superior pole, occurs in up to 20% of individuals and places the nerve at a greater risk of injury. Therefore, the superior pole vessels should not be ligated en masse, but should be individually divided, low on the thyroid gland and dissected lateral to the cricothyroid muscle. Injury to this nerve leads to inability to tense the ipsilateral vocal cord and hence difficulty “hitting high notes,” difficulty projecting the voice, and voice fatigue during prolonged speech.Sympathetic innervation of the thyroid gland is provided by fibers from the superior and middle cervical sympathetic ganglia. The fibers enter the gland with the blood vessels and are vasomotor in action. Parasympathetic fibers are derived from the vagus nerve and reach the gland via branches of the laryngeal nerves.Parathyroid Glands. The embryology and anatomy of the parathyroid glands are discussed in detail in
Document 13 (Title: Thyroidectomy -- Anatomy and Physiology -- Vascular Supply and Drainage): The superior thyroid vein originates at the upper pole of the thyroid gland from the thyroid venous plexus. Traveling superiorly and laterally, it crosses over the superior belly of the omohyoid muscle and the common carotid artery before draining into the internal jugular vein. The superior thyroid artery accompanies this vein, which primarily drains venous blood from the thyroid gland and larynx, receiving tributaries from the superior laryngeal and cricothyroid veins. The middle thyroid vein is the shortest of the thyroid veins. This vein originates on the lateral surface of the thyroid lobe at the midthyroid level and then crosses the common carotid artery to empty directly into the internal jugular vein. The inferior thyroid vein arises from the lower border of the thyroid isthmus and typically appears as paired veins on the right and left. These veins descend to form the pretracheal venous plexus, which lies anterior to the trachea and deep into the sternothyroid muscle. The inferior thyroid veins are the largest and most variable among the thyroid veins, often showing asymmetry and differing patterns in number, course, and termination points. [7] See Image. Arterial and Venous Anatomy of the Thyroid Gland.
Document 14 (Title: [Synchronous association of carcinoma of the superior aerodigestive ways and lymph node metastasis of papillary adenocarcinoma of the thyroid: presentation of 6 cases].): Six cases are reported of an unusual synchronous association between aerodigestive squamous cell carcinoma and papillary carcinoma of the thyroid. Six males (47-62 years) were observed until 1975 at the Department of Head and Neck Surgical Oncology of the Istituto Nazionale Tumori, Milan. All were affected by aerodigestive cancer: oral cavity (1), pyriform sinuses (1), larynx (2), lip (1) and oropharynx (1). Clinical examination of the thyroid was always negative. For this reason they underwent surgery, complete surgical approach to aerodigestive neoplasm; one hemithyroidectomy and one total thyroidectomy were also performed. Unexpectedly pathological examination of the dissected lymph nodes indicated the presence of metastases of papillary carcinoma of the thyroid. Three of the six cases had only metastases of thyroid papillary carcinoma while the others presented both squamous cell and papillary carcinoma metastases. Excluding the 2 patients who had undergone thyroid surgery during aerodigestive cancer therapy, in 3 of the 6 patients, two total thyroidectomies and one hemithyroidectomy were performed after the metastases were discovered. In all cases, primary thyroid cancers were demonstrated. One patient did not undergo any subsequent surgery on the thyroid gland because of negative thyroid scanning and bad prognosis due to aerodigestive cancer. Two of the 6 patients died of aerodigestive cancer at 54 and 34 months, 2 are still alive and free of both diseases while one was lost after a 43 month follow-up.
Document 15 (Title: Clear cell carcinoma of the thyroid. A case report.): A rare case of clear cell carcinoma of the thyroid is presented herein. A 31-year-old male had a large soft tumor in the right lobe of the thyroid which showed a hot nodule on scintigram with 99mTc. A right hemithyroidectomy was thus performed after the preoperative diagnosis of a functioning tumor had been made. At surgery, a tiny nodule behind the tumor was found and the histopathological diagnoses of the large tumor and the tiny nodule were clear cell carcinoma and papillary carcinoma, respectively. The thyroglobulin stain was positive in the cytoplasm of many clear cells and scattered colloid. This patient has been well without any evidence of recurrence over the past five years following surgery. The biological characteristics of clear cell carcinoma of the thyroid are discussed in this report.
