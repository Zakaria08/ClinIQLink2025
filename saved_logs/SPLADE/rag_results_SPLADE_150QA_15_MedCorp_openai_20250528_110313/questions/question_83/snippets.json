        "content": "In addition to patient-care benefits, HIT is also thought to improve the efficiency of delivering healthcare services. Some of the smaller yet still meaningful changes included improved coordination and scheduling of care and decreased administrative bureaucracy. However, improved communication through HIT systems is hoped to have an even more meaningful impact. One of the challenges of delivering healthcare efficiently is having necessary data in-hand at the right time. Because healthcare in the United States is largely fractured between competing groups of healthcare systems, private practice specialists, and hospitals, information such as test results and medical histories is often not transmitted between these entities in an efficient and timely manner. As a result, when a patient seeks services outside of his or her primary healthcare system, requests for information must be processed, and tests repeated to determine the appropriate service to deliver. In the previous era of paper records, this challenge was even greater as information even within the patient\u2019s own medical system had to be retrieved from a file archive. With EMRs now widespread, data within an organization can now be retrieved from an electronic data warehouse instantaneously. Unfortunately, data transfer across systems has remained a challenge; EMRs across the various providers generally cannot send information electronically. Currently, efforts are underway to build out\u00a0robust healthcare information exchange (HIE) networks\u00a0to facilitate the retrieval\u00a0of patient information generated at another provider or health system independently of the specific home EHR platform or vendor.\u00a0In another step advancing this cause, the healthcare standards organization Health Level Seven International (HL7) in 2014 proposed Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR), a proposed set of software and programming standards that would standardize EMR and associated HIT software for the purpose of universal interoperability. \u00a0 Outside the hospital, health insurance companies can also take advantage of these systems to improve their practices. With digitally transmitted data comes faster and more complete processing of claims. Furthermore, HIT-software can now analyze claims data which improves actuarial calculations, comparisons of cost-effectiveness between institutions, and also helps to better detect cases of healthcare insurance fraud.",

Three \"markers,\" recent innovation in medical practice, were chosen using an expert consensus technique. A telephone survey of 200 office-based pediatricians was conducted, and the physicians were asked whether or not they used the following three innovations in medical practice: continuous rather than intermittent phenobarbital for the prevention of febrile seizures, glycosylated hemoglobin measurement in the management of diabetes, and slow release theophylline in the management of asthma. The questionnaire was completed by 156 pediatricians. Of the 110 pediatricians who cared for diabetics, 73% used glycosylated hemoglobin measurement; of the 145 who saw patients with febrile seizures, 77% prescribed the continuous use of phenobarbital (if they used it at all); and, of the 152 pediatricians who cared for asthmatics, 86% reported using slow-release theophylline. The characteristics significantly associated with using the innovations were board certification, group rather than solo practice, teaching, medically related publications, academic appointment, younger age, and caring for a greater number of patients per week. For two of the innovations, discussion with a colleague was the most important source of information leading to a change of practice. The subjects cited local specialists as the colleagues who most often sparked the adoption of an innovation.",
