Male gonadal development For males, the testes form at six fetal weeks and the sertoli cells begin developing by the eight week of gestation. SRY, the sex-determining locus, serves to differentiate the Sertoli cells. The Sertoli cells are the point of origin for anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone. Once synthesized, the anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone initiates the ipsilateral regression of the M\u00fcllerian tract and inhibits the development of female internal features. At 10 weeks of gestation, the Leydig cells begin to produce androgen hormones. The androgen hormone dihydrotestosterone is responsible for the development of the male external genitalia.",

A diagnosis of schizophrenia was made two years previously, since then oral anti-psychotic drugs such as chlorpromazine had been given to her. In June 1989 she suddenly became excited and generalized muscle rigidity was observed without any triggering episodes. Her excitement was so marked that we had to administer intramuscular levomepromazine 75 mg and diazepam 10 mg to her, but they failed to sedate her adequately. Emergency Cesarean section was scheduled to overcome this situation. Spinal or epidural anesthesia was not indicated because of her vigorous excitement, and anesthesia was induced with thiopental 350 mg and succinylcholine 40 mg. Induction-delivery time was 12 minutes. Pentazocine 30 mg in combination with nitrous oxide was given for the maintenance of anesthesia. Plasma levomepromazine levels were 46.9 ng.ml-1 in the mother and 11.3 ng.ml-1 in the umbilical vein, respectively. The baby's Apgar score was 9 and 1 min and 9 at 5 min after the delivery.

Data were analyzed for each mother-infant pair over the time of labor and birth. The saltatory pattern was demonstrated in 10 of the 433 tracings reviewed for an overall incidence of 2.3%. All 10 fetuses demonstrating the saltatory pattern were term (38 to 42 weeks' gestation). None of the 147 preterm fetuses demonstrated the saltatory pattern (P less than .02). In 6 patients the saltatory pattern was observed after parenteral ephedrine administration, in 3 patients with uterine hyperstimulation, and in 1 patient during cervical examination. When the saltatory pattern was seen with ephedrine administration, it was present only at total doses of greater than or equal to 30 mg (P less than .001). In all patients the saltatory pattern occurred during active phase or second stage of labor. Short-term and long-term variability recorded by the fetal-scalp electrode were present both before and after the episode of saltatory pattern. At birth, all 10 infants were vigorous, with Apgar scores of 8/9 or 9/9. In the absence of abnormal periodic fetal heart rate changes and with the presence of short-term and long-term variability, the saltatory fetal heart rate pattern appears benign.",
        "contents": "Saltatory fetal heart rate pattern. A retrospective descriptive study reviewed 433 consecutive intrapartum fetal heart tracings. The saltatory fetal heart rate pattern was defined as fetal heart amplitude changes of greater than 25 beats per minute with an oscillatory frequency of greater than 6 per minute for a minimum duration of 1 minute. Data were analyzed for each mother-infant pair over the time of labor and birth. The saltatory pattern was demonstrated in 10 of the 433 tracings reviewed for an overall incidence of 2.3%. All 10 fetuses demonstrating the saltatory pattern were term (38 to 42 weeks' gestation). None of the 147 preterm fetuses demonstrated the saltatory pattern (P less than .02). In 6 patients the saltatory pattern was observed after parenteral ephedrine administration, in 3 patients with uterine hyperstimulation, and in 1 patient during cervical examination. When the saltatory pattern was seen with ephedrine administration, it was present only at total doses of greater than or equal to 30 mg (P less than .001). In all patients the saltatory pattern occurred during active phase or second stage of labor. Short-term and long-term variability recorded by the fetal-scalp electrode were present both before and after the episode of saltatory pattern. At birth, all 10 infants were vigorous, with Apgar scores of 8/9 or 9/9. In the absence of abnormal periodic fetal heart rate changes and with the presence of short-term and long-term variability, the saltatory fetal heart rate pattern appears benign.",

        "content": "Life history Nutria can live up to six years in captivity, but individuals uncommonly live past three years old; according to one study, 80% of nutrias die within the first year, and less than 15% of a wild population is over three years old. Male nutrias reach sexual maturity as early as four months, and females as early as three months; however, both can have a prolonged adolescence, up to the age of 9 months. Once a female is pregnant, gestation lasts 130 days, and she may give birth to as few as one or as many as 13 offspring. They generally line nursery nests with grasses and soft reeds. Baby nutrias are precocial, born fully furred and with open eyes; they can eat vegetation with their parents within hours of birth. A female nutria can become pregnant again the day after she gives birth to her young. If timed properly, a female can become pregnant three times within a year. Newborn nutrias nurse for seven to eight weeks, after which they leave their mothers.",
