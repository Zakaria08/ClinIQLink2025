Document 1 (Title: Endocrine system): Gonads The reproductive system begins development at four to five weeks of gestation with germ cell migration. The bipotential gonad results from the collection of the medioventral region of the urogenital ridge. At the five-week point, the developing gonads break away from the adrenal primordium. Gonadal differentiation begins 42 days following conception. Male gonadal development For males, the testes form at six fetal weeks and the sertoli cells begin developing by the eight week of gestation. SRY, the sex-determining locus, serves to differentiate the Sertoli cells. The Sertoli cells are the point of origin for anti-Müllerian hormone. Once synthesized, the anti-Müllerian hormone initiates the ipsilateral regression of the Müllerian tract and inhibits the development of female internal features. At 10 weeks of gestation, the Leydig cells begin to produce androgen hormones. The androgen hormone dihydrotestosterone is responsible for the development of the male external genitalia.
Document 2 (Title: Risk Management Event Evaluation and Responsibilities -- Issues of Concern -- Patient Handoff): For example, handoff of a patient following the "I-PASS" system would be structured as follows: "This patient is a watcher. Ms. X is a 65-year-old female, anticoagulated on apixaban, who presented to the ED after a mechanical fall. She was neurologically intact, but her head CT showed a subdural hematoma without midline shift, so she was admitted to the ICU. She needs neurological checks every 1 hour and a repeat head CT in 4 hours. Should she have an acute mental status change, please plan to reverse her anticoagulation, consider intubating her and giving hypertonic saline, obtain a STAT head CT, and contact neurosurgery immediately. "After this, the receiving provider would summarize the patient and repeat the action points back to ensure proper understanding.
Document 3 (Title: Biochemistry_Lippinco): Choose the ONE best answer. For Questions 26.1 and 26.2, use the following scenario. A 40-year-old woman, 5 ft, 1 in (155 cm) tall and weighing 188 lb (85.5 kg), seeks your advice on how to lose weight. Her waist measured 41 in and her hips 39 in. The remainder of the physical examination and the blood laboratory data were all within the normal range. Her only child (who is age 14 years), her sister, and both of her parents are overweight. The patient recalls being overweight throughout her childhood and adolescence. Over the past 15 years, she had been on seven different diets for periods of 2 weeks to 3 months, losing from 5 to 25 lb each time. On discontinuation of the diets, she regained weight, returning to 185–190 lb. 6.1. Calculate and interpret the body mass index for the patient. Body mass index (BMI) = weight in kg/(height in m)2 = 85.5/1.552 = 35.6. Because her BMI is >30, the patient is classified as obese.
Document 4 (Title: [An emergency cesarean section using general anesthesia for a patient with schizophrenia].): A 27 year-old female in 39th week gestation with schizophrenia underwent an emergency Cesarean section using general anesthesia. A diagnosis of schizophrenia was made two years previously, since then oral anti-psychotic drugs such as chlorpromazine had been given to her. In June 1989 she suddenly became excited and generalized muscle rigidity was observed without any triggering episodes. Her excitement was so marked that we had to administer intramuscular levomepromazine 75 mg and diazepam 10 mg to her, but they failed to sedate her adequately. Emergency Cesarean section was scheduled to overcome this situation. Spinal or epidural anesthesia was not indicated because of her vigorous excitement, and anesthesia was induced with thiopental 350 mg and succinylcholine 40 mg. Induction-delivery time was 12 minutes. Pentazocine 30 mg in combination with nitrous oxide was given for the maintenance of anesthesia. Plasma levomepromazine levels were 46.9 ng.ml-1 in the mother and 11.3 ng.ml-1 in the umbilical vein, respectively. The baby's Apgar score was 9 and 1 min and 9 at 5 min after the delivery. The baby developed slight generalized tremor until next day, probably due to effect of levomepromazine given before the Cesarean section. The patient was discharged without any cardiorespiratory trouble and her baby has been doing well so far.
Document 5 (Title: Biochemistry_Lippinco): Patient Presentation: BE is a 45-year-old woman who presents with concerns about sudden (paroxysmal), intense, brief episodes of headache, sweating (diaphoresis), and a racing heart (palpitations). Focused History: BE reports that the attacks started ~3 weeks ago. They last from 2 to 10 minutes, during which time she feels quite anxious. During the attacks, it feels as though her heart is skipping beats (arrhythmia). At first, she thought the attacks were related to recent stress at work and maybe even menopause. The last time it happened, she was in a pharmacy and had her blood pressure taken. She was told it was 165/110 mm Hg. BE notes that she has lost weight (~8 lbs) in this period even though her appetite has been good.
Document 6 (Title: Screening with Doppler velocimetry in labor.): Doppler flow velocimetry was performed on 273 nonselected patients in labor. All patients were at least 2 cm dilated and 80% effaced (58% greater than 4 cm) and were delivered of infants within 24 hours. Fetal heart rate tracing performed at the same time was read by another observer and compared with Doppler flow velocity measurements (systolic/diastolic ratio, pulsatility index). A significant correlation was noted (r = 0.234, p less than 0.001) between the two modalities. Both fetal heart rate tracings and umbilical flow velocity measurements were correlated with fetal outcome. Significant associations were noted between the umbilical systolic/diastolic ratio and fetal distress. 5-minute Apgar scores, the need for intubation independent of gestational age, and umbilical arterial cord pH and base excess. It appears that the information obtained from flow velocimetry had additional benefits compared with that of fetal heart rate tracings alone.
Document 7 (Title: Persistent pulmonary arterial hypertension of the newborn.): Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) characterised by right to left shunting with intense cyanosis is difficult to manage, and in the best of centres carries a 40-60 percent mortality. We report our one year's experience of managing six neonates with PPHN. There were 5 males and 1 female with mean birth weight of 2.59 +/- 0.487 kg and gestation period 39 +/- 2.0 wks and 1 minute Apgar score 2.8 +/- 2.1. Four to six babies were born by cesarean section and 3-6 babies had aspiration pneumonia. All babies presented within 12 hours of age (mean 5.08 +/- 5 hrs) with intense cyanosis and respiratory distress. Diagnosis were confirmed in all by (a) hyperoxia test, (b) simultaneous determination of preductal and postductal paO2 (c) contrast echocardiography and (d) hyperoxia-hyperventilation test. Babies were managed with hyperventilation using mean ventilatory rates of 100 +/- 45 per minute, an inspired oxygen concentration of 100%, peak inspiratory pressures 27 +/- 9 cm of H2O, and expiratory pressures 5 +/- 1.6 cms of H2O, and mean air way pressures of 10.4 +/- 2.7 cms H2O. Alkali therapy was used in 3 of the six babies whereas low dose dopamine was infused in all six babies. Inspite of aggressive ventilatory therapy, only 3 out of 6 babies could be salvaged.
Document 8 (Title: Defamation -- Definition/Introduction -- What are Defamation and Cyber Defamation?): Case 2. A 33-year-old female underwent elective breast augmentation and botulinum toxin injections 2 weeks ago. After the dressing came off, she was not satisfied with the result. The surgeon had told her she had to wait until the swelling and edema subsided. Only then would she see the cosmetic benefits. The patient went on social media and posted negative reviews about the surgeon. She claimed she had suffered major complications from breast augmentation and that the surgeon ignored her. She suggested that other patients not visit this surgeon for cosmetic surgery because he was reluctant to see her after the surgery. Her opinion was that the surgeon was not skilled and incompetent. The surgeon came across the review on Yelp and filed a lawsuit for defamation. In court, the surgeon had the appointment book, pre-and post-surgery photos, and all the communications between himself and the patient. The surgeon claimed in court that he never neglected the patient, asked her to follow up, and waited for the swelling to subside before she saw the cosmetic result. She instead defamed him on social media, and the jury sided with him. The surgeon also claimed that this false statement about him has resulted in a decline in new patients seeking surgery. The patient lost the lawsuit and paid the surgeon over $300,000 in damages.
Document 9 (Title: Granuloma Inguinale -- Complications): A 19-year-old woman also from Madurai presented to Rajaji Hospital with an antepartum hemorrhage at 24 weeks gestation. She was found to have a granulomatous cauliflower-like ulcerative growth in the vaginal vault. Smears of the ulcer showed Donovan Bodies. She was successfully treated with streptomycin with an almost complete resolution of her symptoms after 1 month. [9] Thappa et al described a case of malignant transformation. A 25-year-old man from India presented with a lesion over the glans penis for 4 years duration. Donovan Bodies were seen on the tissue smear. However, he failed treatment with co-trimoxazole and azithromycin. A biopsy revealed squamous cell carcinoma. [10]
Document 10 (Title: Cardiotocography): Category I (Normal): Tracings with all these findings present are strongly predictive of normal fetal acid-base status at the time of observation and the fetus can be followed in a standard manner: Baseline rate 110–160bpm, Moderate variability, Absence of late or variable decelerations, Early decelerations and accelerations may or may not be present. Category II (Indeterminate): Tracing is not predictive of abnormal fetal acid-base status. Evaluation and continued surveillance and reevaluations are indicated. Bradycardia with normal baseline variability Tachycardia Minimal or Marked baseline variability of FHR Accelerations: Absence of induced accelerations after fetal stimulation Periodic or Episodic decelerations: Longer than 2 minutes but shorter than 10 minutes; recurrent late decelerations with moderate baseline variability Variable decelerations with other characteristics such as slow return to baseline, overshoots of "shoulders" seen (humps on either side of deceleration)
Document 11 (Title: Obstentrics_Williams): Diferentiating an abnormal etal heart rate (FHR) tracing on presentation versus one that develops subsequently was also emphasized by the 20 14 Task Force. A category 1 or 2 FHR tracing associated with Apgar scores ?7 at 5 minutes, normal cord gases (± 1 SD), or both are not consistent with an acute HIE event (Graham, 2014). An FHR pattern at the time of presentation with persistently minimal or absent variability and lacking accelerations, with duration ?60 minutes, and even without decelerations is suggestive of an already compromised fetus (Chap. 24, p. 462). The 2014 Task Force further recommended that if fetal well-being cannot be established with these findings present, the woman should be evaluated for the method and timing of delivery.
Document 12 (Title: Root Cause Analysis and Medical Error Prevention -- Function -- Case example 1): A 42-year-old primigravida woman at 34 weeks gestation was brought to the obstetric emergency department at midnight with complaints of severe headache, blurry vision, and right upper quadrant pain for the last 5 to 6 hours. She noted lower extremity edema and facial swelling that was gradually increasing. She has gestational hypertension and, 1 week ago, was prescribed labetalol 200 mg twice a day. On initial presentation, her blood pressure was 190/110 mm Hg on 2 separate occasions, 5 minutes apart. She had gained 2 kilograms since her last antenatal checkup in the clinic a week ago. The patient was diagnosed with severe preeclampsia. The senior obstetric resident ordered a loading dose of magnesium sulfate to prevent imminent seizure. The hospital protocol used an intravenous (IV) and intramuscular (IM) regimen where the patient received a 4 g IV bolus and a 10 g IM dose administered as 5 g in each buttock. The senior resident gave verbal orders for magnesium sulfate administration to the junior resident, who verbally communicated the order to the nurse.
Document 13 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): A 21-year-old woman comes with her parents to discuss therapeutic options for her Crohn’s disease. She was diag-nosed with Crohn’s disease 2 years ago, and it involves her terminal ileum and proximal colon, as confirmed by colonoscopy and small bowel radiography. She was initially treated with mesalamine and budesonide with good response, but over the last 2 months, she has had a relapse of her symptoms. She is experiencing fatigue, cramping, abdominal pains, and nonbloody diarrhea up to 10 times daily, and she has had a 15-lb weight loss. She has no other significant medical or surgical his-tory. Her current medications are mesalamine 2.4 g/d and budesonide 9 mg/d. She appears thin and tired. Abdominal examination reveals tenderness without guarding in the right lower quadrant; no masses are palpable. On perianal examination, there is no tenderness, fissure, or fistula. Her laboratory data are notable for anemia and elevated C-reactive protein. What are the options for immediate
Document 14 (Title: Saltatory fetal heart rate pattern.): A retrospective descriptive study reviewed 433 consecutive intrapartum fetal heart tracings. The saltatory fetal heart rate pattern was defined as fetal heart amplitude changes of greater than 25 beats per minute with an oscillatory frequency of greater than 6 per minute for a minimum duration of 1 minute. Data were analyzed for each mother-infant pair over the time of labor and birth. The saltatory pattern was demonstrated in 10 of the 433 tracings reviewed for an overall incidence of 2.3%. All 10 fetuses demonstrating the saltatory pattern were term (38 to 42 weeks' gestation). None of the 147 preterm fetuses demonstrated the saltatory pattern (P less than .02). In 6 patients the saltatory pattern was observed after parenteral ephedrine administration, in 3 patients with uterine hyperstimulation, and in 1 patient during cervical examination. When the saltatory pattern was seen with ephedrine administration, it was present only at total doses of greater than or equal to 30 mg (P less than .001). In all patients the saltatory pattern occurred during active phase or second stage of labor. Short-term and long-term variability recorded by the fetal-scalp electrode were present both before and after the episode of saltatory pattern. At birth, all 10 infants were vigorous, with Apgar scores of 8/9 or 9/9. In the absence of abnormal periodic fetal heart rate changes and with the presence of short-term and long-term variability, the saltatory fetal heart rate pattern appears benign.
Document 15 (Title: Nutria): Life history Nutria can live up to six years in captivity, but individuals uncommonly live past three years old; according to one study, 80% of nutrias die within the first year, and less than 15% of a wild population is over three years old. Male nutrias reach sexual maturity as early as four months, and females as early as three months; however, both can have a prolonged adolescence, up to the age of 9 months. Once a female is pregnant, gestation lasts 130 days, and she may give birth to as few as one or as many as 13 offspring. They generally line nursery nests with grasses and soft reeds. Baby nutrias are precocial, born fully furred and with open eyes; they can eat vegetation with their parents within hours of birth. A female nutria can become pregnant again the day after she gives birth to her young. If timed properly, a female can become pregnant three times within a year. Newborn nutrias nurse for seven to eight weeks, after which they leave their mothers.
