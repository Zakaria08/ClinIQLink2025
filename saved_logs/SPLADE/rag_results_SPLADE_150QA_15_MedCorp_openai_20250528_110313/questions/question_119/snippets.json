Average recoveries at fortification levels of 2, 5 and 10 ng/ml were 114%, 109% and 106%, respectively.

A buffer can be created by mixing a weak acid (HA) with its conjugate base (A\u2212). If an acid such as HCl is added to a buffer, A\u2212 can neutralize it, being converted to HA in the process.

        "title": "The use of borohydrides of alkaline metals in the volumetric analysis of medicaments.",
        "content": "The possibility and conditions of determination of weak acid type medicaments were examined, using aqueous and non-aqueous sodium borohydride volumetric solutions. The process and control of titration were carried out potentiometrically and visually using acido-basic indicators. It was shown that for practical applications sodium borohydride aqueous solutions are more suitable. Analytical methods of determination for medicaments from the group of sulphonamides and barbiturates and their sodium salts, for phenylbutazone and kebuzone, salicylamide, nalidixic acid and theophylline were elaborated. All results were in good agreement with methods used in CsL 3, or other alternative methods. The advantages of the proposed method are good stability of sodium borohydride volumetric solution and insensitivity of titrated systems to CO2 from the atmosphere, which is unavoidable with alkalimetric titrations in aqueous and non-aqueous systems. An hypothesis has been suggested to explain the probable reactive mechanism of determination, supported by results obtained with the proposed analytical methods using a medium of suitable organic solvents with a maximum content of ca. 15% water near the final point of titration.",

Bilirubin measurement: Bilirubin is commonly measured by the van den Bergh reaction, in which diazotized sulfanilic acid reacts with bilirubin to form red azodipyrroles that are measured colorimetrically. In aqueous solution, the water-soluble CB reacts rapidly with the reagent (within 1 minute) and is said to be direct reacting. The UCB, which is much less soluble in aqueous solution, reacts more slowly. However, when the reaction is carried out in methanol, both CB and UCB are soluble and react with the reagent, providing the total bilirubin value. The indirect-reacting bilirubin, which corresponds to the UCB, is obtained by subtracting the direct-reacting bilirubin from the total bilirubin. [Note: In normal plasma, only ~4% of the total bilirubin is conjugated, or direct reacting, because most is secreted into bile.]",

        "content": "When treatment is appropriate, there are\u00a03 recommended removal methods: cerumenolytic agents, irrigation, and manual removal. [11] Cerumenolytic agents are liquid solutions that help thin, soften, break up, or dissolve ear wax. These are typically water- or oil-based compounds, with water-based solutions being the most commonly used. Typical ingredients in water-based cerumenolytics include hydrogen peroxide, acetic acid, docusate sodium, and sodium bicarbonate. Docusate sodium appears to be the most effective, particularly when pre-treatment before irrigation. [13] Common ingredients in oil-based cerumenolytics include peanut, olive, and almond oils. Most drops are available over the counter. Typically, up to\u00a05 drops are used\u00a0per dose,\u00a01 to\u00a02 times daily for\u00a03 to\u00a07 days. A commonly prescribed cerumenolytic is carbamide peroxide. Five to 10 drops are placed twice daily for up to\u00a04 days. The drops work by releasing oxygen to soften and encourage spontaneous cerumen extrusion and have a weak antibacterial effect.",
