Document 1 (Title: Development of vaccines against hepatitis A and hepatitis B.): Hepatitis A and hepatitis B are viral infections of the liver. Hepatitis A is spread by the fecal-oral route--i.e., by ingestion of virus shed in the stool of acutely infected individuals. The virus is transmitted from person to person or (in outbreaks) via contaminated food or water. Population groups at increased risk of acquiring hepatitis A include children and staff in day care centers. Hepatitis B is spread by blood and other body fluids from acutely infected individuals or chronically infected carriers. Infection occurs when virus contained in these fluids enters the body through mucosal surfaces or breaks in the skin. A vaccine against hepatitis B has been developed. It consists of noninfectious hepatitis B surface antigen purified from the plasma of chronic carriers. The three sequential inactivation treatments used in manufacture of the vaccine kill hepatitis B virus and other infectious agents that may be present in human plasma, including the human T cell-lymphotropic virus that causes the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. The vaccine is well tolerated, highly immunogenic, and highly effective in preventing hepatitis B. Both live attenuated and killed vaccines against hepatitis A are also being investigated. A live attenuated vaccine is preferred and seems feasible on the basis of initial studies in animals and volunteers.

Document 3 (Title: Hepatitis A Vaccine -- Indications): The causative agent for hepatitis A is a positive-strand RNA virus belonging to the hepatovirus genus. This class of virus primarily affects the liver and causes inflammation. Hepatitis A is transmitted mainly via the fecal-oral route or through close physical contact. Transmission from fecal material can happen by directly touching feces or consuming food and water contaminated with fecal matter. [1]
Document 4 (Title: Pregnancy and Viral Hepatitis -- Etiology -- Hepatitis A): Hepatitis A virus (HAV) is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the family Picornaviridae with a single serotype worldwide. [3] The virus is mainly transmitted through the fecal-oral route and is most prevalent in developing countries with poor hygiene and sanitation due to food and water contamination. The virus can be transmitted through sexual contact and rarely through blood exposure in injecting drug users during a blood transfusion .
Document 5 (Title: Viral hepatitis): Hepatitis A or infectious jaundice is caused by hepatitis A virus (HAV), a picornavirus transmitted by the fecal-oral route often associated with ingestion of contaminated food. It causes an acute form of hepatitis and does not have a chronic stage. The patient's immune system makes antibodies against HAV that confer immunity against future infection. People with hepatitis A are advised to rest, stay hydrated and avoid alcohol. A vaccine is available that will prevent HAV infection for up to 10 years. Hepatitis A can be spread through personal contact, consumption of raw sea food, or drinking contaminated water. This occurs primarily in third world countries. Strict personal hygiene and the avoidance of raw and unpeeled foods can help prevent an infection. Infected people excrete HAV with their feces two weeks before and one week after the appearance of jaundice. The time between the infection and the start of the illness averages 28 days (ranging from 15 to 50 days), and most recover
Document 6 (Title: Hepatitis E -- Introduction): Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is the most common cause of acute viral hepatitis in the world. Due to nonspecific symptoms and a self-limited disease course, it is also not frequently diagnosed. HEV is classified in the genus Orthohepevirus of the Hepeviridae family. It is an icosahedral, nonenveloped virus. HEV has a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome that is approximately 27 to 34 nm in diameter. [1] [2] [3] HEV is mainly transmitted via the fecal-oral route. It typically causes acute, self-limited hepatitis in normal hosts. It can also cause chronic hepatitis in immunosuppressed patients. It is associated with a higher mortality rate compared to acute hepatitis A virus infection, which is also transmitted via the enteric route. HEV infection can cause high mortality in pregnant females. The first evidence of an enterically transmitted viral hepatitis distinct from the hepatitis A virus (HAV) came from studies of a waterborne hepatitis epidemic in the late 1970s in Kashmir, India. It was initially identified as a non-A, non-B hepatitis (NANBH). Khuroo determined that the patients involved in the epidemic lacked serological evidence of acute hepatitis A, thereby raising concern that another infective agent likely caused the outbreak. [4] Three years later, Balayan and colleagues confirmed the existence of a new virus with enteric transmission. [1] NANB hepatitis was later called Hepatitis E to conform to the accepted nomenclature of other hepatitis viruses.
Document 7 (Title: Hepatitis): Hepatitis D The hepatitis D virus requires that a person first be infected with hepatitis B virus, so prevention efforts should focus on limiting the spread of hepatitis B. In people who have chronic hepatitis B infection and are at risk for superinfection with the hepatitis D virus, the preventive strategies are the same as for hepatitis B. Hepatitis E Hepatitis E is spread primarily through the oral-fecal route but may also be spread by blood and from mother to fetus. The mainstay of hepatitis E prevention is similar to that for hepatitis A (namely, good hygiene and clean water practices). Alcoholic hepatitis As excessive alcohol consumption can lead to hepatitis and cirrhosis, the following are maximal recommendations for alcohol consumption: Women – ≤ 3 drinks on any given day and ≤ 7 drinks per week Men – ≤ 4 drinks on any given day and ≤ 14 drinks per week Successes Hepatitis A
Document 8 (Title: Astrovirus): Avastrovirus species often infect extraintestinal sites such as the kidney or liver resulting in hepatitis and nephritis. Birds infected by avian nephritis virus typically die within 3 weeks of infection. The viral particles can be detected in fecal matter within 2 days and peak virus shedding occurs 4–5 days after infection. The virus can be found in the kidney, jejunum, spleen, liver and bursa of infected birds. Symptoms of this disease include diarrhea and weight loss. Necropsies show swollen and discolored kidneys and there is evidence of death of the epithelial cells and lymphocytic interstitial nephritis. Another extraintestinal avastrovirus is avian hepatitis virus which infects ducks. Hepatitis in ducks caused by this duck astrovirus (DAstV) is often fatal. In birds, Avastroviruses are detected by antigen-capture ELISA. In the absence of vaccines, sanitation is the prevalent way to prevent Avastrovirus infections.
Document 9 (Title: Viral Hepatidities (Archived) -- Etiology): The hepatotropic viruses are by far the most common causes of viral hepatitis. All of them are RNA viruses except for Hepatitis B, which is a DNA virus. Hepatitis A and E are transmitted via the fecal-oral route, whereas Hepatitis B, C, and D are primarily blood-borne. [3] Hepatitis A virus (HAV) is typically transmitted by contamination of water and food by the feces of an infected individual. Poor personal hygiene is a risk factor. [3]
Document 10 (Title: Hepatitis B virus infection in Southeast Asian children.): Since the end of the war in Vietnam, approximately 850,000 Southeast Asian refugees have come to the United States. They present a challenge for health care providers because of language and cultural differences that can create barriers to effective health care. Nurse practitioners who work with Southeast Asian refugees should be aware that hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is highly endemic in Southeast Asia, and the virus is most commonly transmitted during the perinatal period or during childhood. HBV infection can cause acute hepatitis B, chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and primary hepatocellular carcinoma and is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. Susceptible children and infants born to mothers who are hepatitis B carriers should be vaccinated with the hepatitis B vaccine. Vaccination can prevent the serious sequelae of HBV in a high percentage of the pediatric population.
Document 11 (Title: Mutations within the S gene of hepatitis B virus transmitted from mothers to babies immunized with hepatitis B immune globulin and vaccine.): A variant of hepatitis B virus (HBV) having a specific mutation within the S gene has been found to infect vaccinees. To know whether similar variants were involved in Japan, we analyzed two cases of maternal transmission of HBV in infants immunized with hepatitis B immune globulin and hepatitis B vaccine. DNA clones of HBV S genes were propagated from patients and family members and sequenced. In one family, the DNA clones from the baby patient had a Gly-to-Arg mutation at the 145th codon of the S gene, whereas those from her mother had no such mutations. In the other family, all the DNA clones obtained from the two infected children had the 145th codon intact, but they had a missense mutation at the 126th codon of the S gene, causing an amino acid substitution of Asn for Thr or Ile. This same mutation was observed in 12 of 17 clones of DNA obtained from their mother. In comparison with the wild type HBV-derived hepatitis B surface antigen, the two types of S gene mutations, either at the 145th or the 126th codon, were associated with a significant decrease in the antigenicity of some determinants on the hepatitis B surface antigen, measured by MAb. Amino acid substitution at these sites, therefore, would have induced the escape from conventional vaccines that were S gene products of wild type HBV and also from hepatitis B immune globulin, whose main components were probably also antibodies against the S gene products expressed by wild type HBV.
Document 12 (Title: Murine coronavirus): There are more than 25 different strains of murine coronavirus. Transmitted by the fecal–oral or respiratory route, these viruses infect the livers of mice and have been used as an animal disease model for hepatitis. Transmitted in fecal matter, the strains MHV-D, MHV-DVIM, MHV-Y and MHV-RI mainly infect the digestive tract, sometimes infecting the spleen, liver and lymphatic tissue. MHV-1, MHV-2, MHV-3, MHV-A59, MHV-S, MHV-JHM and other virus strains replicate in the respiratory tract and then spread to other organs such as the liver, lungs and brain. MHV-JHM mainly infects the central nervous system and has been widely studied since 1949. In rats, these nerve-infecting hepatitis viruses can cause acute or chronic neurological symptoms and stimulate the immunity of mice upon infection. Infection leads to demyelination, serving as an animal disease model of multiple sclerosis. MHV-2, MHV-3 and MHV-A59 can also infect the liver; the first two of these are more virulent. MHV-3 is the
Document 13 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Viral Hepatitis (See Chap. 360) The incidence of viral hepatitis, once a major scourge of military campaigns and their aftermath, has declined considerably over the past half-century of military engagements. Although more than 115,000 cases of viral hepatitis, most due to hepatitis A virus, were reported among Soviet troops serving in Afghanistan in the 1980s, only rare reports of hepatitis A and B were noted during the massive, short-term deployment of U.S. troops to the Persian Gulf in the early 1990s. Hepatitis A and E, endemic in many parts of the developing world, present clinically as acute infections transmitted by the fecal-oral route and can be largely controlled with interventions practiced widely among military forces from industrialized countries: appropriate food and water hygiene and pre-deployment vaccination against hepatitis A. Hepatitis B contamination of serum-stabilized yellow fever vaccine caused a large outbreak of the disease among
Document 14 (Title: Spider angioma): Spider Angiomas (spider-like blood vessels on the skin) are one of the main symptoms caused by a Hepatitis C (HCV virus) infection. Discovering an infected patient with hepatitis C early on in the infection phase increases the chances of the virus being successfully treated and cured by oral medication. Some patients can be infected with Hepatitis C for decades without knowing, and without experiencing any signs or symptoms of the virus. Unfortunately, while Hepatitis A and B have a protective vaccine available, there are not any vaccines available to protect against the HCV virus (Hepatitis C), Once contracted, if left untreated Hepatitis C can cause the liver to swell or become inflamed, making it difficult to function adequately in order to properly filter out chemicals and toxins. When the Hepatits C (HCV) infection turns chronic, it can cause full-blown cirrhosis of the liver (scarring of the liver), making it difficult for the liver to filter out waste and to store nutrients.
Document 15 (Title: Liver disease): A common form of liver disease is viral infection. Viral hepatitides such as Hepatitis B virus and Hepatitis C virus can be vertically transmitted during birth via contact with infected blood. According to a 2012 NICE publication, "about 85% of hepatitis B infections in newborns become chronic". In occult cases, Hepatitis B virus is present by hepatitis B virus DNA, but testing for HBsAg is negative. High consumption of alcohol can lead to several forms of liver disease including alcoholic hepatitis, alcoholic fatty liver disease, cirrhosis, and liver cancer. In the earlier stages of alcoholic liver disease, fat builds up in the liver's cells due to increased creation of triglycerides and fatty acids and a decreased ability to break down fatty acids. Progression of the disease can lead to liver inflammation from the excess fat in the liver. Scarring in the liver often occurs as the body attempts to heal and extensive scarring can lead to the development of cirrhosis in more advanced
