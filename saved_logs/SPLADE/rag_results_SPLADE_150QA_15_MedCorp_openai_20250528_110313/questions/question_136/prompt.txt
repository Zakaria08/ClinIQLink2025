Document 1 (Title: Cell_Biology_Alberts): Figure 9–12 Fluorescence and the fluorescence microscope. (a) an orbital electron of a fluorochrome molecule can be raised to an excited state following the absorption of a photon. Fluorescence occurs when the electron returns to its ground state and emits a photon of light at a longer wavelength. too much exposure to light, or too bright a light, can also destroy the fluorochrome molecule, in a process called photobleaching. (B) in the fluorescence microscope, a filter set consists of two barrier filters (1 and 3) and a dichroic (beam-splitting) mirror (2). this example shows the filter set for detection of the fluorescent molecule fluorescein. high-numerical-aperture objective lenses are especially important in this type of microscopy because, for a given magnification, the brightness of the fluorescent image is proportional to the fourth power of the numerical aperture Figure 9–14 Different fluorescent probes can be visualized in the same cell. in this composite micrograph of a
Document 2 (Title: Biochemistry, Polymerase Chain Reaction -- Fundamentals -- Real-Time PCR): The sensitivity of fluorophores has been an essential aspect of qPCR development. Two main types of fluorophores are used in qPCR: those that bind specifically to a given target sequence and those that lack specificity in binding. One of the most effective and widely used non-specific markers, SYBR Green, after binding to the minor groove of dsDNA, exhibits a 1000-fold increase in fluorescence compared to being free in solution. However, if even more specificity is desired, a sequence-specific oligonucleotide, or hybridization probe, can be added, which binds to the target gene at some point, following the primer (after the 3' end). These hybridization probes contain a reporter molecule at the 5' end and a quencher molecule at the 3' end. The quencher molecule effectively inhibits the reporter from fluorescing while the probe is intact. However, upon contact with DNA polymerase I, the hybridization probe is cleaved, allowing the dye's fluorescence.
Document 3 (Title: Reactions between primary and secondary acceptors of photosystem II in Chlorella pyrenoidosa under anaerobic conditions as studied by chlorophyll fluorescence.): The kinetics of the fluorescence yield phi of chlorophyll a in Chlorella pyrenoidosa were studied under anaerobic conditions in the time range from 50 mus to several minutes after short (t 1/2 = 30 ns or 5 mus) saturating flashes. The fluorescence yield "in the dark" increased from phi = 1 at the beginning to phi approximately 5 in about 3 h when single flashes separated by dark intervals of about 3 min were given. After one saturating flash, phi increased to a maximum value (4-5) at 50 mus, then phi decreased to about 3 with a half time of about 10 ms and to the initial value with a half time of about 2 s. When two flashes separated by 0.2 s were given, the first phase of the decrease after the second flash occurred within 2 ms. After one flash given at high initial fluorescence yield, the 10-ms decay was followed by a 10 s increase to the initial value. After the two flashes 0.2 s apart, the rapid decay was not followed by a slow increase. These and other experiments provided additional evidence for and extend an earlier hypothesis concerning the acceptor complex of Photosystem II (Bouges-Bocquet, B. (1973) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 314, 250-256; Velthuys, B. R. and Amesz. J. (1974) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 333, 85-94): reaction center 2 contains an acceptor complex QR consisting of an electron-transferring primary acceptor molecule Q, and a secondary electron acceptor R, which can accept two electrons in succession, but transfers two electrons simultaneously to a molecule of the tertiary acceptor pool, containing plastoquinone (A). Furthermore, the kinetics indicate that 2 reactions centers of System I, excited by a short flash, cooperate directly or indirectly in oxidizing a plastohydroquinone molecule (A2-). If initially all components between photoreaction 1 and 2 are in the reduced state the following sequence of reactions occurs after a flash has oxidised A2- via System I: Q-R2- + A leads to Q-R + A2- leads to QR- + A2-. During anaerobiosis two slow reactions manifest themselves: the reduction of R (and A) within 1 s, presumably by an endogenous electron donor D1, and the reduction of Q in about 10 s when R is in the state R- and A in the state A2-. An endogenous electron donor, D2, and Q- complete in reducing the photooxidized donor complex of System II in reactions with half times of the order of 1 s.
Document 4 (Title: Fluorescence spectroscopy): Fluorescence spectroscopy (also known as fluorimetry or spectrofluorometry) is a type of electromagnetic spectroscopy that analyzes fluorescence from a sample. It involves using a beam of light, usually ultraviolet light, that excites the electrons in molecules of certain compounds and causes them to emit light; typically, but not necessarily, visible light. A complementary technique is absorption spectroscopy. In the special case of single molecule fluorescence spectroscopy, intensity fluctuations from the emitted light are measured from either single fluorophores, or pairs of fluorophores. Devices that measure fluorescence are called fluorometers. Theory
Document 5 (Title: Fluorescein -- Indications -- Conjugate Species/Biomarker): Fluorescent microscopy allows for the identification of microorganisms or cellular components, such as proteins, in immunohistological staining. In the most common indirect method of immunohistochemistry, the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) uses fluorescein to act as a fluorescent conjugated to secondary antibodies. Moreover, certain compounds commonly modify or combine with the original fluorescein structure to adjust the attachment of the fluorescent tag to specific macromolecules. The combination of water-soluble chitosan derivative with a fluorescent tag created glycol chitosan fluorescein-isothiocyanate (GC-FITC), which showed to be a sufficient agent used for bio-imaging when compared to its commercial equivalents. Even at a lower concentration, the biocompatibility of the molecule, as well as the strong affinity to the cell surface through a strong electrostatic interaction, offer efficient cell staining, namely for the identification of lipid rafts.

Document 6 (Title: Cell_Biology_Alberts): Techniques are now available for detecting, measuring, and following almost any desired molecule in a living cell. Fluorescent indicator dyes can be introduced to measure the concentrations of specific ions in individual cells or in different parts of a cell. Virtually any protein of interest can be genetically engineered as a fluorescent fusion protein, and then imaged in living cells by fluorescence microscopy. The dynamic behavior and interactions of many molecules can be followed in living cells by variations on the use of fluorescent protein tags, in some cases at the level of single molecules. Various superresolution techniques can circumvent the diffraction limit and resolve molecules separated by distances as small as 20 nm. Looking at CeLLs anD MoLeCULes in the eLeCtron MiCrosCope
Document 7 (Title: Spectral [corrected] studies on the cadmium-ion-binding properties of bovine brain S-100b protein.): The effect of Cd2+ binding on bovine brain S-100b protein was studied using c.d. u.v. difference spectroscopy and fluorescence measurements. At pH 7.5, S-100b protein binds two Cd2+ ions per monomer with a Kd value of 3 x 10(-5) M. Addition of Cd2+ resulted in perturbing the single tyrosine residue (Tyr17) in the protein as indicated by u.v. difference spectroscopy and aromatic c.d. measurements. In the presence of Cd2+, the tyrosine residue moves to a more non-polar environment, since a red shift was observed in the u.v. difference spectrum. When the protein was excited at 278 nm, the tyrosine fluorescence emission maximum was centred at 306 nm. Cd2+ addition resulted in an increase in intrinsic fluorescence intensity. Fluorescence titration with Cd2+ indicated the protein binds Cd2+ with a Kd value of 3 x 10(-5) M. 2-p-Toluidinylnaphthalene-6-sulphonate-labelled protein, when excited at 345 nm, had a fluorescence emission maximum at 440 nm. Addition of Cd2+ to labelled protein resulted in a 5-fold increase in fluorescence intensity accompanied by a 5 nm blue shift in the emission maximum, suggesting that the probe, in the presence of Cd2+, moves to a hydrophobic domain. U.v. difference spectroscopic studies indicated a unique Cd2(+)-binding site on the protein, since Cd2+ addition yielded a large positive absorption band in the 240 nm region that is not found with either Ca2+ or Zn2- ions. Similar absorption bands have been observed in Cd-protein complexes such as Cd-metallothionein [Vasak, Kagi &amp; Hill (1981) Biochemistry 20, 2852-2856] and also in model complexes of Cd2+ with 2-mercaptoethanol. This absorption band is believed to arise as a result of charge-transfer transitions between the thiolate and Cd2+. Of the two Cd2- -binding sites on the beta-chain, one must be located at the N-terminal end near the single tyrosine residue, since Cd2- and Zn2+ produced similar effects on the intrinsic protein fluorescence. The other Cd2+ site which is unique to Cd2+ must be Cys84, located at the C-terminal end.
Document 8 (Title: Fluorescence spectroscopy): Devices that measure fluorescence are called fluorometers. Theory Molecules have various states referred to as energy levels. Fluorescence spectroscopy is primarily concerned with electronic and vibrational states. Generally, the species being examined has a ground electronic state (a low energy state) of interest, and an excited electronic state of higher energy. Within each of these electronic states there are various vibrational states. In fluorescence, the species is first excited, by absorbing a photon, from its ground electronic state to one of the various vibrational states in the excited electronic state. Collisions with other molecules cause the excited molecule to lose vibrational energy until it reaches the lowest vibrational state from the excited electronic state. This process is often visualized with a Jablonski diagram.
Document 9 (Title: The liver cell plasma membrane Ca2+ inflow systems exhibit a broad specificity for divalent metal ions.): 1. The inflow of Mn2+ across the plasma membranes of isolated hepatocytes was monitored by measuring the quenching of the fluorescence of intracellular quin2, by atomic absorption spectroscopy and by the uptake of 54Mn2+. The inflow of other divalent metal ions was measured using quin2. 2. Under ionic conditions which resembled those present in the cytoplasmic space, Mn2+, Zn2+, Co2+, Ni2+ and Cd2+ each quenched the fluorescence of a solution of Ca2(+)-quin2. 3. The addition of Mn2+, Zn2+, Co2+, Ni2+ or Cd2+ to cells loaded with quin2 caused a time-dependent decrease in the fluorescence of intracellular quin2. Plots of the rate of decrease in fluorescence as a function of the concentration of Mn2+ reached a plateau at 100 microM-Mn2+. 4. The rate of decrease in fluorescence induced by Mn2+ was stimulated by 20% in the presence of vasopressin. The effect of vasopressin was completely inhibited by 200 microM-verapamil. Adrenaline, angiotensin II and glucagon also stimulated the rate of decrease in the fluorescence of intracellular quin2 induced by Mn2+. 5. The rate of decrease in fluorescence induced by Zn2+, Co2+, Ni2+ or Cd2+ was stimulated by between 20 and 190% in the presence of vasopressin or angiotensin II. 6. The rates of uptake of Mn2+ measured by atomic absorption spectroscopy or by using 54Mn2+ were inhibited by about 20% by 1.3 mM-Ca2+o and stimulated by 30% by vasopressin. 7. Plots of Mn2+ uptake, measured by atomic absorption spectroscopy or with 54Mn2+, as a function of the extracellular concentration of Mn2+ were biphasic over the range 0.05-1.0 mM added Mn2+ and did not reach a plateau at 1.0 mM-Mn2+. 8. It is concluded that (i) hepatocytes possess both a basal and a receptor-activated divalent cation inflow system, each of which has a broad specificity for metal ions, and (ii) the receptor-activated divalent cation inflow system is the receptor-operated Ca2+ channel.
Document 10 (Title: Photoluminescence): Experimental methods Photoluminescence spectroscopy is a widely used technique for characterisation of the optical and electronic properties of semiconductors and molecules. The technique its self is fast, contactless, and nondestructive. Therefore, it can be used to study the optoelectronic properties of materials of various sizes (from microns to centimeters) during the fabrication process without complex sample preparation. In chemistry, it is more often referred to as fluorescence spectroscopy, but the instrumentation is the same. The relaxation processes can be studied using time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy to find the decay lifetime of the photoluminescence. These techniques can be combined with microscopy, to map the intensity (confocal microscopy) or the lifetime (fluorescence-lifetime imaging microscopy) of the photoluminescence across a sample (e.g. a semiconducting wafer, or a biological sample that has been marked with fluorescent molecules).
Document 11 (Title: Molecular sensor): In contrast, then in the case of luminescent chemosensors, the detection of an analyte, using fluorescence spectroscopy, gives rise to spectral changes in the fluorescence excitation or in the emission spectra, which are recorded using a fluorimeter. Such changes can also occur in other excited state properties such as in the excited state life-time(s), quantum yield of fluorescence, and polarisation, etc. of the chemosensor. Fluorescence detection can be achieved at a low concentration (below ~ 10-6 M) with most fluorescence spectrometers. This offers the advantage of using the sensors directly within fibre optic systems. Examples of the use of chemosensors are to monitor blood content, drug concentrations, etc., as well as in environmental samples. Ions and molecules occur in abundance in biological and environmental systems where they are involved/effete biological and chemical processes. The development of molecular chemosensors as probes for such analytes is an annual
Document 12 (Title: Binding of phosphorylcholine to an IgM Waldenström as studied by fluorescence spectroscopy and circular dichroism.): The binding characteristics of an IgM Waldenström(FR) for the ligand phosphorylcholine has been studied by fluorescence spectroscopy. Upon phosphorylcholine addition, IgM FR exhibited 83% enhancement of the tryptophanyl fluorescence, which was associated with a red shift of the emission maximun (5nm). The same properties were observed with the 7S IgM subunits. The association constant KA for phosphorylcholine was 6X10(4) M-1 FOR IgM FR and the 7S subunit, as determined by fluorescence titration, a value in agreement with the obtained by equilibrium dialysis. No significant decrease in the KA value was found in the presence of 3 M urea; in 6 M urea, the increase in fluorescence intensity was 36% of the value obtained in the absence of denaturing agent. In contrast, only 4% of fluorescence enhancement was noted upon binding in 3 M GuHC1 and no enhancement could be seen when the concentration of  GuHC1 was increased to 5 M, thus suggesting complete unfolding of the protein and subsequent loss of binding activity. The pH dependence study of the phosphorylcholine binding to IgM FR indicated no significant differences in the fluorescence enhancement between pH 5 and 8, whereas at more acidic or alkaline pH values, the enhancement became smaller. At pH 3.0 and 10.0, no enhancement was seen suggesting no binding of the ligand, a fact confirmed independently by equilibrium dialysis. When the spectroscopic properties of the IgM FR were compared with those of murine myeloma proteins that bind the same ligand large differences were recorded in the amplitude of the  phosphorylcholine induced enhancement of the fluorescnece and in the shift of the emission maximum wavelength. This suggests that the human and murine proteins interact differently with the small ligand phosphorylcholine thus implying that the variable domains of these molecules are not identical
Document 13 (Title: Dental Caries Diagnostic Testing -- Procedures -- Light-Induced Fluorescence): Light-induced fluorescence utilizes the natural fluorescence of teeth to differentiate caries from healthy enamel. This is because lesions have a lower fluorescent radiance than sound enamel. [1] This tool provides information about the lesion size, percentile fluorescence loss (Delta F), lesion volume (Delta Q), bacterial activity and presence of red fluorescence (Delta R), and staining intensity (Delta E). Demineralization increases fluorescence loss, and remineralization decreases it.
Document 14 (Title: Tinea Manuum -- Evaluation): Fluorescent staining: Fluorescent staining with optical brighteners might be used to increase the fungal detection rate. This stain selectively binds to chitin of the fungal cell wall and then gives an apple-green fluorescence when visualized under fluorescent microscopy. Histopathology: Histopathology might be necessary, especially when other skin diseases are suspected in the differential diagnosis.
Document 15 (Title: Dental Caries Diagnostic Testing -- Introduction): Newer diagnostic tools, such as laser fluorescence detection devices and light-induced fluorescence, give more accurate information about the carious lesion. Light-induced fluorescence detects the lesion's specific location and extension and bacterial activity - quantitative data. [1] Laser fluorescence detection devices detect remineralization and demineralization processes, which can be implemented to diagnose an incipient lesion and assess the efficacy of a remineralization therapy. Since this tool provides a numerical value, it is considered a quantitative test. [2]
