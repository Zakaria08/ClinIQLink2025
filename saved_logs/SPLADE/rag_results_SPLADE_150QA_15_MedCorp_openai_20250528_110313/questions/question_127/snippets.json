If the person is diagnosed late, antibiotics will not alter the course of the illness, and even without antibiotics, they should no longer be spreading pertussis.

Short-term antibiotics (azithromycin for 3\u20135 days) are as effective as long-term treatment (erythromycin 10\u201314 days) in eliminating B. pertussis with fewer and less severe side effects.",
