In some patients, signs and symptoms indicating involvement of the meninges, cranial nerves and the white matter of the cord were observed; motor paralysis was the most striking feature during the whole clinical course; it consisted of flaccid asymmetrical weakness in one or more limbs, usually being more severe in the lower limbs than in the upper, and often more proximal than distal.

The pattern and prognosis of flaccid motor paralysis were reminiscent of acute poliomyelitis in which the anterior horn cells of the spinal cord are mainly involved.

        "contents": "Brown-S\u00e9quard Syndrome -- Pathophysiology. Corticospinal tracts: Anterior and lateral corticospinal tracts\u00a0carry efferents from the primary motor cortex to the ventral horn primary motor neurons. Hemisection of\u00a0the spinal cord would produce an ipsilateral hemiplegia from the level of the lesion distally. Symptoms of upper and lower motor neuron lesions,\u00a0including flaccid paralysis, changes in muscle mass, fasciculations, and decreased tone, will be present only at the level of injury.
