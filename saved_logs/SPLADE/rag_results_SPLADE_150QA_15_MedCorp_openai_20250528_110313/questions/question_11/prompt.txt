Document 1 (Title: Carotid-cavernous fistula): A carotid-cavernous fistula results from an abnormal communication between the arterial and venous systems within the cavernous sinus in the skull. It is a type of arteriovenous fistula. As arterial blood under high pressure enters the cavernous sinus, the normal venous return to the cavernous sinus is impeded and this causes engorgement of the draining veins, manifesting most dramatically as a sudden engorgement and redness of the eye of the same side. Presentation CCF symptoms include bruit (a humming sound within the skull due to high blood flow through the arteriovenous fistula), progressive visual loss, and pulsatile proptosis or progressive bulging of the eye due to dilatation of the veins draining the eye. Pain is the symptom that patients often find the most difficult to tolerate. Patients usually present with sudden or insidious onset of redness in one eye, associated with progressive proptosis or bulging.They may have a history of similar episodes in the past.
Document 2 (Title: [Three cases of spontaneous bilateral external carotid-cavernous sinus fistula (dural arteriovenous shunts in the region of the cavernous sinus) (author's transl)].): Since Fincher reported a case with arteriovenous fistula between the external carotid artery and dural sinus, many type of cases have been reported. On the other hand, so called the external carotid avernous fistula has been recognized less 20 cases in literature. We have observed three additional cases of dural arteriovenous shunts in the region of the cavernous sinus. Case 1. A 52 year old woman had suffered from left side sever headache. There was weakness of the left extraocular muscles and left ptosis. A bruit was heard over the left orbit. She was treated for hypertension since 38 year old. And she has no history of recent trauma. Selective internal and external carotid angiographies showed the bilateral external carotid cavernous sinus fistula. No operative treatment was performed in this case and the symptomes disappeared with decrease of blood pressure. Case 2. A 50 year old man came to this clinic with chief complaints of right ptosis, diplopia and headache. He was treated for diabetes mellitus and hypertension for six month...
Document 3 (Title: Malignant Orbital Tumors -- History and Physical): A complete ophthalmic examination, including visual acuity, pupillary response, extraocular muscle function, exophthalmometry, tonometry, and fundoscopy, is required. Skin, conjunctival, and corneal sensation, along with any lid lag, should also be documented. Findings such as tortuous conjunctival vessels or choroidal-retinal folds may point towards orbital pathology. For the measurement of ptosis, the margin-to-reflex distance, which is the distance in millimeters between the corneal light reflex to the upper eyelid (MRD1) or lower eyelid (MRD2), can be used to measure eyelid positioning, ptosis, lagophthalmos, ectropion, and scleral show. A complete cranial nerve examination is required, with special attention paid to V1, V2, V3, and any pain with ocular movements. Unilateral proptosis points more towards primary or secondary orbital pathology rather than a systemic disease like Graves ophthalmopathy. Asymmetry of >2 mm between the prominence of the 2 eyes is considered significant. Palpation may reveal a firm globe with restricted mobility, which is worrisome for orbital malignancy. [19] [5] [20]
Document 4 (Title: Carotid Cavernous Fistula -- Evaluation): Tonometry and pneumotonometry may show an increased ocular pulse amplitude in the side of the carotid-cavernous fistula compared to the fellow eye. [3] [6] A B-scan ultrasound or color Doppler will show a dilated superior ophthalmic vein (SOV) or orbital congestion. Patients suspected of having a CCF eventually undergo noninvasive imaging such as a standard CT (computed tomography) or MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan which can show a dilated SOV, orbital congestion, or enlargement of the extraocular muscles. A CTA (computed tomography angiography) or MRA (magnetic resonance angiography) may also be utilized as both imaging modalities are sensitive in detecting CCFs resulting in visual symptoms. [1] A cerebral angiogram is the gold standard test for diagnosing a CCF, which can show filling of the cavernous sinus through the fistula, drainage pattern of the fistula, and presence of reflux into cortical veins following an injection of CCA (common carotid artery), ECA, or ICA. [3]
Document 5 (Title: [An attempt of electrothrombosis of carotid-cavernous fistula (author's transl)].): The patient was 50 year-old female who was admitted to our department on June 13, 1973 complaining of left conjunctival injection and ipsilateral exophthalmos. Visual acuity of her right eye had been lost almost completely due to the previous ocular injury. Ophthalmological examination revealed left conjunctival injection, slight ipsilateral proptosis but pulsation of eye ball, chemosis and bruit were not so obvious. She had a visual acuity of 1.2 on her left eye. Left intraocular pressure was 30 mmHg while right was normal. Left CAG revealed a left carotid-cavernous fistula with anterior, posterior, inferior venous drainage. Temporal craniotomy was done and copper needles were inserted into the posterior part of Parkinson's triangle. An angiogram after operation demonstrated the persistency of the anterior and posterior venous drainage. 6 weeks later, electrothrombosis of left superior ophthalmic vein was carried out. After that, carotid-cavernous fistula disappeared perfectly. Important points of the surgical technique are; 1) to apply a silverclip to the tentorial edge just posterior to the third nerve, than anatomical realtionship of internal carotid artery, cavernous sinus and the clip applied are carefully investigated on the subsequent angiograms. 2) to repeat angiography several titate of embolization of cavernous sinus should often be checked.
Document 6 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): JP is a 33-year-old woman who presents with complaints of fatigue requiring daytime naps, weight gain, cold intoler-ance, and muscle weakness for the last few months. These complaints are new since she used to always feel “hot,” noted difficulty sleeping, and could eat anything that she wanted without gaining weight. She also would like to become preg-nant in the near future. Because of poor medication adherence to methimazole and propranolol, she received radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy, developed hypothyroidism, and was started on levothyroxine 100 mcg daily. Other medications include calcium carbonate three times daily to “protect her bones” and omeprazole for “heartburn.” On physical exami-nation, her blood pressure is 130/89 mm Hg with a pulse of 50 bpm. Her weight is 136 lb (61.8 kg), an increase of 10 lb (4.5 kg) in the last year. Her thyroid gland is not palpable and her reflexes are delayed. Laboratory findings include a thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level of 24.9 μIU/mL
Document 7 (Title: Neurology_Adams): The idiopathic granulomatous painful condition of the cavernous sinus has been termed Tolosa-Hunt syndrome; a similar process affecting structures of the orbit is known as orbital pseudotumor. Orbital pseudotumor causes an inflammatory enlargement of the extraocular muscles, which often also encompasses the globe and other orbital contents (Fig. 13-8). It is often accompanied by injection of the conjunctiva and lid and slight proptosis. One or more muscles may be involved and there is a tendency to relapse and later to involve the opposite globe. Visual loss from compression of the optic nerve is a rare complication. Associations with connective tissue disease have been reported and IgG4-related sclerosis has increasingly been identified as a cause. Ultrasonography examination or CT scans of the orbit show enlargement of the orbital muscles including the tendons, as opposed to thyroid ophthalmopathy in which the muscles are enlarged but the muscle tendons are typically spared.
Document 8 (Title: Case Study: 33-Year-Old Female Presents with Chronic SOB and Cough (Archived) -- Case Presentation): History of Present Illness: A 33-year-old white female presents after admission to the general medical/surgical hospital ward with a chief complaint of shortness of breath on exertion. She reports that she was seen for similar symptoms previously at her primary care physician’s office six months ago. At that time, she was diagnosed with acute bronchitis and treated with bronchodilators, empiric antibiotics, and a short course oral steroid taper. This management did not improve her symptoms, and she has gradually worsened over six months. She reports a 20-pound (9 kg) intentional weight loss over the past year. She denies camping, spelunking, or hunting activities. She denies any sick contacts. A brief review of systems is negative for fever, night sweats, palpitations, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, neural sensation changes, muscular changes, and increased bruising or bleeding. She admits a cough, shortness of breath, and shortness of breath on exertion.
Document 9 (Title: Anatomy_Gray): Most of these changes are transient and are usually due to traction injuries during the surgical procedure. A 33-year-old fit and well woman came to the emergency department complaining of double vision and pain behind her right eye. She had no other symptoms. On examination of the right eye the pupil was dilated. There was a mild ptosis. Testing of eye movement revealed that the eye turned down and out and the pupillary reflex was not present. These findings revealed that the patient had an ipsilateral third nerve palsy (palsy of the oculomotor nerve [III]). The oculomotor nerve [III] is the main motor nerve to the ocular and extra-ocular muscles. It arises from the midbrain and pierces the dura mater to run in the lateral wall of the cavernous sinus. The oculomotor nerve [III] leaves the cranial cavity and enters the orbit through the superior orbital fissure. Within this fissure it divides into its superior and inferior divisions.
Document 10 (Title: Chemosis): If chemosis has occurred due to excessive rubbing of the eye, the first aid to be given is a cold water wash for eyes. Other causes of chemosis include: Superior vena cava obstruction, accompanied by facial oedema Hyperthyroidism, associated with exophthalmos, periorbital puffiness, lid retraction, and lid lag Cavernous sinus thrombosis, associated with infection of the paranasal sinuses, proptosis, periorbital oedema, retinal haemorrhages, papilledema, extraocular movement abnormalities, and trigeminal nerve sensory loss Carotid-cavernous fistula - classic triad of chemosis, pulsatile proptosis, and ocular bruit Cluster headache Trichinellosis Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) Angioedema Acute glaucoma Panophthalmitis Orbital cellulitis Gonorrheal conjunctivitis Dacryocystitis Spitting cobra venom to the eye High concentrations of phenacyl chloride in chemical mace spray Urticaria Trauma HSV Keratitis Post surgical Mucor Rhabdomyosarcoma of the orbit Diagnosis
Document 11 (Title: Biochemistry_Lippinco): Choose the ONE best answer. For Questions 26.1 and 26.2, use the following scenario. A 40-year-old woman, 5 ft, 1 in (155 cm) tall and weighing 188 lb (85.5 kg), seeks your advice on how to lose weight. Her waist measured 41 in and her hips 39 in. The remainder of the physical examination and the blood laboratory data were all within the normal range. Her only child (who is age 14 years), her sister, and both of her parents are overweight. The patient recalls being overweight throughout her childhood and adolescence. Over the past 15 years, she had been on seven different diets for periods of 2 weeks to 3 months, losing from 5 to 25 lb each time. On discontinuation of the diets, she regained weight, returning to 185–190 lb. 6.1. Calculate and interpret the body mass index for the patient. Body mass index (BMI) = weight in kg/(height in m)2 = 85.5/1.552 = 35.6. Because her BMI is >30, the patient is classified as obese.
Document 12 (Title: Biochemistry_Lippinco): Patient Presentation: BE is a 45-year-old woman who presents with concerns about sudden (paroxysmal), intense, brief episodes of headache, sweating (diaphoresis), and a racing heart (palpitations). Focused History: BE reports that the attacks started ~3 weeks ago. They last from 2 to 10 minutes, during which time she feels quite anxious. During the attacks, it feels as though her heart is skipping beats (arrhythmia). At first, she thought the attacks were related to recent stress at work and maybe even menopause. The last time it happened, she was in a pharmacy and had her blood pressure taken. She was told it was 165/110 mm Hg. BE notes that she has lost weight (~8 lbs) in this period even though her appetite has been good.
Document 13 (Title: [Abulia: a case of cerebral infarction in the bilateral genua of internal capsules].): A patient was presented with an outstanding symptom of abulia due to cerebral infarcts in the bilateral genua of internal capsules. A 53-year-old woman, generally in good health and active, had no contributory medical history except for hypertension. She was well until August 20, 1988, when she was noted to have become taciturn and absent-minded. In the morning, she got up and went to work as usual. Although she worked without trouble, she hardly talked with her colleagues. After getting home from work, she would lie down without doing any housework, and this was continued on the following day. However, she had no physical problems. She was thus admitted to a hospital on August 22. Lethargy and urinary incontinence were apparent for a few days. Thereafter she became awakeful and could take care of herself. She sat on her bed all the time, and could talk normally with her daughter. She was referred subsequently to the Department of Neurology, Hyogo Prefectural Tsukaguchi Hospital on August 30. On examination, the patient was alert, polite and cooperative with no physical abnormalities except for high blood pressure. Neurological examination indicated the patient to be attentive and well-oriented. Cranial nerves and eye movements were normal except for slight anisocoria and sluggish pupils. There were no muscle weakness, extrapyramidal signs, or cerebellar signs. Deep tendon reflexes were normal. Babinski signs and forced grasping were not noted. A neuropsychological study showed the patient not to be demented, aphasic, or apraxic.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Document 14 (Title: Sphenoid wing meningioma): Sphenoid wing meningiomas are diagnosed by the combination of suggestive symptoms from the history and physical and neuroimaging by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computer averaged tomography (CT). Tumors growing in the inner wing (clinoidal) most often cause direct damage to the optic nerve leading especially to a decrease in visual acuity, progressive loss of color vision, defects in the field of vision (especially cecocentral), and an afferent pupillary defect. If the tumor continues to grow and push on the optic nerve, all vision will be lost in that eye as the nerve atrophies. Proptosis, or anterior displacement of the eye, and palpebral swelling may also occur when the tumor impinges on the cavernous sinus by blocking venous return and leading to congestion. Damage to cranial nerves in the cavernous sinus leads to diplopia. Cranial nerve VI is often the first affected, leading to diplopia with lateral gaze. If cranial nerve V-1 is damaged, the patient will have pain
Document 15 (Title: Neuroanatomy, Brain Veins -- Clinical Significance -- Cavernous Sinus Syndrome): Cavernous sinus syndrome results from obstruction, inflammation, or increase in pressure in the cavernous sinus. Some of the causes include thrombophlebitis, which can be caused by bacteria or fungus spreading from the nasal mucosa, paranasal sinuses, or after a skull fracture. A thrombus can form in any person with a hypercoagulable state, such as protein C or S deficiency, factor V Leiden, or use of combined oral contraceptive pills. Tumors can cause it as well, such as a locally extensive pituitary adenoma. Additionally, an internal carotid artery aneurysm can cause a similar syndrome. Should the aneurysm rupture, a carotid-cavernous fistula can form, causing increased pressure in the sinus. The symptoms of cavernous sinus syndrome reflect the effects on surrounding structures and the cranial and sympathetic nerves passing through the sinus. Involvement of the sympathetic plexus can result in a partial Horner syndrome. Since CN III, IV, and VI are affected, ophthalmoplegia can be expected. Notably, in a carotid artery aneurysm, CN VI is affected first, as it lies in closest proximity to the artery. Proptosis and even pain when pressing on the globe can also occur due to the increased pressure behind the eye. Diagnosis is usually through head imaging showing occlusion, thickening, or swelling of the sinus, often with engorgement of the ophthalmic veins as a result. Treatment involves treating any underlying infection or surgery to decompress the sinus. [18]

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
Question: A 46-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 2-week history of diplopia and ocular pain when reading the newspaper. She also has a 3-month history of amenorrhea, hot flashes, and increased sweating. She reports that she has been overweight all her adult life and is happy to have lost 6.8-kg (15-lb) of weight in the past 2 months. Her pulse is 110/min, and blood pressure is 148/98 mm Hg. Physical examination shows moist palms and a nontender thyroid gland that is enlarged to two times its normal size. Ophthalmologic examination shows prominence of the globes of the eyes, bilateral lid retraction, conjunctival injection, and an inability to converge the eyes. There is no pain on movement of the extraocular muscles. Visual acuity is 20/20 bilaterally. Neurologic examination shows a fine resting tremor of the hands. Deep tendon reflexes are 3+ with a shortened relaxation phase. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's ocular complaints?
Options:
A. Granulomatous inflammation of the cavernous sinus
B. Abnormal communication between the cavernous sinus and the internal carotid artery
