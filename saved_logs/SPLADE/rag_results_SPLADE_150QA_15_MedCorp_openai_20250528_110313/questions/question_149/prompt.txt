Document 1 (Title: Lupus Nephritis -- Introduction): Monitoring for the development of lupus nephritis involves serial assessments of creatinine levels, urine protein-to-creatinine ratio, and urinalysis. These tests help detect increases in serum creatinine and the presence of proteinuria, which is commonly observed in lupus nephritis. Given the high risk of increased morbidity, timely treatment is crucial to prevent progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). [1] [2] [3] [4] The primary objective of treatment is to normalize kidney function or, at the very least, prevent further decline. Treatment options vary significantly based on the underlying pathological lesions. [5] [6]
Document 2 (Title: [Clinical and pathological analysis of deep mycoses].): Clinical and pathological analysis were performed on 127 cases of deep mycoses diagnosed by autopsy during the 24 years between 1964 and 1987 in Juntendo University Hospital. The following findings were obtained. 1) There has been a tendency for the number of mycoses to increase each year, especially notable for candidiasis and aspergillosis. 2) Underlying diseases were, in order of incidence, various hematologic diseases, solid tumors, inflammatory diseases and collagen diseases; the most common were various types of leukemia. 3) Candidiasis was often observed in patients with gastrointestinal tract cancers. Aspergillosis was often observed in patients with collagen diseases. 4) Regarding the visceral distribution of mycoses, aspergillosis was observed in the lung, candidiasis was observed in the lung, kidney and intestinal tract in decreasing order, and cryptococcosis was also observed in the lung and central nervous system. 5) There was a probability of fungal infections occurring in cases of lymphopenia. 6) A fever was present at the time of hospitalization in many cases of aspergillosis, and the presence of an indwelling catheter was a common feature in cases of candidiasis. 7) Fungemia was frequently observed in candidiasis, but very rarely in cases of aspergillosis. 8) The large amounts of corticosteroid hormones and blood transfusions were suspected as causative factors of fungal infections.

Document 5 (Title: Postpneumonic empyema in childhood: selecting appropriate therapy.): In order to identify appropriate treatment options for postpneumonic empyema, we reviewed the medical records and, when possible, obtained long-term follow-up chest radiographs and pulmonary function tests on children treated for empyema during the past 11 years. Fifty-one patients were treated in various ways, with antibiotics alone (N = 10), or in combination with tube thoracostomy (N = 23) or decortication (N = 18). Despite administration of appropriate antibiotics and establishment of pleural drainage, many children required prolonged hospitalization and eventual decortication. Based on this review, a scoring system was developed allowing early classification by severity of pleural disease. Factors found to be predictors of severe pleural disease include (1) low pleural fluid pH or (2) glucose; (3) presence of moderate or severe scoliosis or (4) pleural peel or parenchymal entrapment by chest radiography; and (5) infection due to anaerobes, gram-negative organisms, or mycoplasma. Complete opacification of a hemithorax on chest radiography and a pleural peel to thoracic ratio greater than 40% were also associated with severe pleural disease. In patients with mild disease (N = 7), response to antibiotics alone, rapid resolution of fever, and shorter hospital stays were observed. In patients with more severe infections (moderate = 22, severe = 22), decortication accomplished earlier defervescence, radiographic improvement, and hospital discharge than simple tube thoracostomy. No deaths or morbidity were associated with decortication, which could often be accomplished through a minithoracotomy. Follow-up chest radiographs and pulmonary fuction tests showed a prompt return to normal after decortication. This experience indicates utility of a pleural disease severity scoring system in selection of treatment options for children with postpneumonic empyema.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Document 6 (Title: Interquartile mean): 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 has a mean value xmean = 3, and since it is a symmetric distribution, xIQM = 3 would be desired. We can solve this by using a weighted average of the quartiles and the interquartile dataset: Consider the following dataset of 9 observations: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17 There are 9/4 = 2.25 observations in each quartile, and 4.5 observations in the interquartile range. Truncate the fractional quartile size, and remove this number from the 1st and 4th quartiles (2.25 observations in each quartile, thus the lowest 2 and the highest 2 are removed). 1, 3, (5), 7, 9, 11, (13), 15, 17 Thus, there are 3 full observations in the interquartile range, and 2 fractional observations. Since we have a total of 4.5 observations in the interquartile range, the two fractional observations each count for 0.75 (and thus 3×1 + 2×0.75 = 4.5 observations). The IQM is now calculated as follows: xIQM = {(7 + 9 + 11) + 0.75 × (5 + 13)} / 4.5 = 9
Document 7 (Title: Frameshift mutation): Tay–Sachs disease is a fatal disease affecting the central nervous system. It is most frequently found in infants and small children. Disease progression begins in the womb but symptoms do not appear until approximately 6 months of age. There is no cure for the disease. Mutations in the β-hexosaminidase A (Hex A) gene are known to affect the onset of Tay-Sachs, with 78 mutations of different types being described, 67 of which are known to cause disease. Most of the mutations observed (65/78) are single base substitutions or SNPs, 11 deletions, 1 large and 10 small, and 2 insertions. 8 of the observed mutations are frameshift, 6 deletions and 2 insertions. A 4 base pair insertion in exon 11 is observed in 80% of Tay-Sachs disease presence in the Ashkenazi Jewish population. The frameshift mutations lead to an early stop codon which is known to play a role in the disease in infants. Delayed onset disease appears to be caused by 4 different mutations, one being a 3 base pair deletion.
Document 8 (Title: Babesiosis): Cause Babesia species are in the phylum Apicomplexa, which also has the protozoan parasites that cause malaria, toxoplasmosis, and cryptosporidiosis. Four clades of Babesia species infect humans. The main species in each clade are: B. microti (<3 µm) B. duncani B. divergens (cattle parasite seen mostly in Europe) and B. venatorum (roe deer parasite, formerly called EU1), most closely related to the large Babesia clade Large Babesia (>3 µm) mostly infects ungulates, but also includes K01 strain (an isolated case observed in South Korea, see isolated cases) Pathophysiology Babesia parasites reproduce in red blood cells, where they can be seen as cross-shaped inclusions (four merozoites asexually budding, but attached together forming a structure looking like a "Maltese cross") and cause hemolytic anemia, quite similar to malaria. Unlike the Plasmodium parasites that cause malaria, Babesia species lack an exoerythrocytic phase, so the liver is usually not affected.
Document 9 (Title: Genodermatosis): Genodermatosis is often rare and varied, but diagnostic methods have some commonalities, the diagnosis of rare genodermatosis is basically divided into six steps: 1. Each genodermatosis has different clinical manifestations. People can observe the special features and changes of the skin to judge whether they are sick or not. Features will be different in different age groups, so it is necessary to observe and record the special features of the skin in each age group; 2. Genodermatosis is a hereditary disease, knowing as much as possible about a detailed and complete family history helps in screening and diagnosis; 3. People can do a detailed physical examination to observe the special features and manifestations of other organs besides skin. It can help to narrow down the disease and make a definitive diagnosis; 4. People can carry out laboratory tests such as skin biopsies with high-tech and precise scientific instruments to have further results; 5. Different genodermatosis and
Document 10 (Title: Periodontal Disease -- Treatment / Management): The treatment of periodontal disease involves a step-wise approach beginning with more conservative options. The initial phase of treatment for all forms of periodontitis is a professional dental cleaning, which includes scaling of the teeth, and root planning to remove dental plaque and calculus found both above and below the gum line. A major part of this dental cleaning is the oral hygiene instruction given by the dental professional to the patient to improve their at-home oral hygiene routine. Following the completion of the cleaning appointment, the patient should return to the dentist for a reevaluation of the periodontal condition, which involves an examination that observes the state of the periodontium, and measures probing depths to see if the disease process was arrested. If the resolution of the condition can be confirmed, the patient should return to the dentist for regularly scheduled cleanings as periodontitis is a chronic disease that can reactivate if given the proper environment [2] [1] [6] .

Document 12 (Title: Ocular Melanoma -- Treatment / Management): Observation is an acceptable option for patients with uveal melanomas who are asymptomatic and have a tumor size <12 mm in diameter and <2 to 3 mm in height. These patients should undergo reevaluation every 2 to 4 months with repeat imaging using fundus photography, ultrasound, OCT, or fundus autofluorescence. Because of the less aggressive nature of melanomas of the iris, these tumors are also often managed with observation. If the tumor is large or rapidly growing, treatment options may include brachytherapy, proton beam RT, local excision, or enucleation, as discussed below.

Document 14 (Title: Malignant Melanoma -- Treatment / Management -- Adjuvant Therapies): Stage IB (T2a) or stage II (≥T2b) If sentinel lymph node biopsy returns negative, patients can either be observed or enrolled in clinical trials or receive 1 year of adjuvant pembrolizumab for stages IIB and IIC. [46] [47] Stage IIIA (sentinel node-positive) with low-risk disease Low-risk disease includes tumors ≤2 mm in thickness, and sentinel node contains <1 mm tumor. Given the low risk of disease recurrence, these patients can be safely observed or receive 1 year of adjuvant nivolumab, pembrolizumab, or dabrafenib/trametinib if BRAF mutated. [48] [28] [49] [50] [51] [52] [51] Stage IIIA/B/C/D (sentinel node-positive) Adjuvant systemic therapy options include nivolumab, pembrolizumab, or dabrafenib/trametinib if BRAF mutated.

Document 15 (Title: Microorganism): Disease Microorganisms are the causative agents (pathogens) in many infectious diseases. The organisms involved include pathogenic bacteria, causing diseases such as plague, tuberculosis and anthrax; protozoan parasites, causing diseases such as malaria, sleeping sickness, dysentery and toxoplasmosis; and also fungi causing diseases such as ringworm, candidiasis or histoplasmosis. However, other diseases such as influenza, yellow fever or AIDS are caused by pathogenic viruses, which are not usually classified as living organisms and are not, therefore, microorganisms by the strict definition. No clear examples of archaean pathogens are known, although a relationship has been proposed between the presence of some archaean methanogens and human periodontal disease. Numerous microbial pathogens are capable of sexual processes that appear to facilitate their survival in their infected host. Hygiene
