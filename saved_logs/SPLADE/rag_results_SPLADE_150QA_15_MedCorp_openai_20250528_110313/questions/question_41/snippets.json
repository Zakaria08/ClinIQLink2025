Clubbing of the digits, a disfigurement of the finger tips or toes (see image) Abnormal pulmonary function test results, with evidence of restriction and impaired gas exchange.

In spite of the use of antibacterial drugs, her symptoms such as cough, dyspnea, malaise and fever increased. It was revealed that she had Stronglyoides sterocoralis in the stool. She was referred to our department for treatment and further examination. Transbronchial lung biopsy (TBLB) was performed, and cyst of Pneumocystis carinii were histologically detected in the lung specimen. Anti-human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) antibody in the serum was 1:4,096 less than. Typical adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) cells were also observed in the peripheral blood smear at the rate of 10-15% of leukocytes. The parasite was observed in the sputum too. We diagnosed her as having Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia with hyperinfection of Strongyloides stercoralis complicated with smoldering ATL, and the pneumonia might have been induced by steroid therapy (total doses of 500 mg, for 25 days). After sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (ST compound) was used for the Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, her symptoms markedly subsided, and the chest X-ray findings turned to normal by 45 days after the treatment. Thiabendazole was initially administered for the Strongyloidiasis and the parasite temporarily disappeared from both sputum and stool. Then pyrvinium pamoate and mebendazole were used, but the parasite could not be completely eradicated in the stool. We did not treat the smoldering ATL because there were no symptoms.

Her symptoms were once resolved, for the time being but she came back to the hospital a week later with a bilateral ear-ache. The tympanic membranes were injected and characteristically retracted. Her left ear showed type B tympanogram (effusion). Tympanocentesis was performed to remove middle-ear effusion, from which C. trachomatis but no ordinary bacterium was isolated. Therefore rokitamycin 300 mg/day was administered for a week. Her condition improved, however, a rhinorrhea, a plugged ear sensation and a hacking cough returned in a month.

A 8-year-old girl was seen on February 23, 1988, because of a running nose, a productive cough and bilateral hearing difficulty. She had a history of recurrent tonsillitis. The diagnosis was acute sinusitis with tubal obstruction, then cefixime was prescribed. Her symptoms were once resolved, for the time being but she came back to the hospital a week later with a bilateral ear-ache. The tympanic membranes were injected and characteristically retracted. Her left ear showed type B tympanogram (effusion). Tympanocentesis was performed to remove middle-ear effusion, from which C. trachomatis but no ordinary bacterium was isolated. Therefore rokitamycin 300 mg/day was administered for a week. Her condition improved, however, a rhinorrhea, a plugged ear sensation and a hacking cough returned in a month. She was admitted to the hospital on May 10, for tympanostomy and grommet insertion, but from the day before admission, she had a sore throat with fever (39.2 degrees C). The surgery was withheld until May 26. When adenotonsillectomy and grommets insertion were undertaken, C. trachomatis had disappeared from the middle-ear effusion, but C. pneumoniae was recovered from both tonsillar and bronchial swabs. Readministration of rokitamycin was performed and to date (June, 1990) she remains well.",

        "content": "Case 2: Skin Rash Patient Presentation: KL is a 34-year-old woman who presents with a red, nonitchy rash on her left thigh and flu-like symptoms. Focused History: KL reports that the rash first appeared a little over 2 weeks ago. It started out small but has gotten larger. She also thinks she is getting the flu because her muscles and joints ache (myalgia and arthralgia, respectively), and she has had a headache for the last few days. Upon questioning, KL reports that she and her husband took a camping trip through New England last month. Pertinent Findings: The physical examination is remarkable for the presence of a red, circular, flat lesion ~11 cm in size that resembles a bullseye (erythema migrans) (see image at right). KL also has a low-grade fever. Diagnosis: KL has Lyme disease caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, which is transmitted by the bite of a tick in the genus Ixodes. Infected ticks are endemic in the Northeast region of the United States.",
