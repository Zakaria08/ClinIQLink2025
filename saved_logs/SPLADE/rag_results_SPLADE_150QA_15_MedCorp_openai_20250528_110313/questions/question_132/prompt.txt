Document 1 (Title: Sexually transmitted diseases in leprosy patients in north and northeastern India. A futile search for human immunodeficiency virus antibody.): Three-hundred-eighty-four leprosy patients were clinically examined for sexually transmitted diseases (STD) in north and northeastern India, revealing a high incidence (5.2%) of STD among them. Eighteen males, one female, and one eunuch were found to have chancroid ulcer, gonococcal urethritis, lymphogranuloma inguinale, and primary chancre. Of these patients, only 100, selected randomly, could be screened serologically for STD due to Treponema pallidum, herpes simplex (type 1 and 2), Entamoeba histolytica, hepatitis-associated virus, cytomegalovirus, Chlamydia trachomatis and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); 100 control sera were included for comparison. In addition, sera from another 133 normal subjects and another 176 lepromatous patients were also screened for HIV antibody. Thus, a total of 233 normal sera and 276 leprosy sera were tested for HIV antibody. Although our leprosy patients have shown significantly high incidences of clinical STD and also high seropositivity against T. pallidum, herpes-simplex viruses types 1 and 2, hepatitis-associated virus, and cytomegalovirus, the search for antibody against HIV was negative. Our clinical and serological data suggest promiscuity in our patient population. The absence of HIV antibody in this high-risk population, however, seems to be an enigma.
Document 2 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): PRETRANSPLANTATION EVALUATION The Donor A variety of organisms have been transmitted by organ transplantation. Transmission of infections that may have been latent or not clinically apparent in the donor has resulted in the development of specific donor-screening protocols. Results from routine blood bank studies, including those for antibodies to Treponema pallidum (syphilis), Trypanosoma cruzi, hepatitis B and C viruses, HIV-1 and -2, human T-lymphotropic virus types 1 and 2 (HTLV-1 and -2), and West Nile virus (WNV), should be documented. Serologic studies should be ordered to identify latent infection with viruses such as herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 (HSV-1, HSV-2), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), Kaposi’s sarcoma–associated herpes-virus (KSHV); acute infection with hepatitis A virus; and infection with the common parasite Toxoplasma gondii. Donors should be screened, when relevant, for viruses such as rabies virus and
Document 3 (Title: Heinrich Pette Institute): Research The aim of the research at the HPI is to develop new approaches for improved diagnostic techniques and therapies for viral diseases and virus-associated tumor diseases. Scholars of the institute explore a wide range of viruses, such as hepatitis viruses (HPV, HCV), herpes viruses (herpes simplex type 1, herpes simplex type 2, Epstein-Barr virus, and Kaposi's sarcoma herpes virus), leukemia viruses (human T-cell leukemia virus-1, murine leukemia virus), coronaviruses, human immunodeficiency virus and DNA tumor viruses (adenoviruses, SV-40). The drive towards practical applications of the results in diagnosis and treatment is reflected in numerous collaborations with clinical institutions and industry. The institute is divided into six research departments, one independent research unit and two independent junior research group. The institute also has two associated groups. The topics of the current working groups are:
Document 4 (Title: Neurology_Adams): A number of viruses share the unique tendency to primarily affect the human nervous system. In some conditions, the systemic effects of the viral infection are negligible; it is the neurologic disorder that brings them to medical attention, that is, the viruses are neurotropic. Included in this group are the human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV-1 and HIV-2), the group of human herpes viruses including herpes simplex viruses (HSV-1 and HSV-2), herpes zoster or varicella zoster virus (VZV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), poliovirus, rabies, and several seasonal arthropod-borne viruses (Flaviviruses). Some of these exhibit an affinity for certain types of neurons: for example, poliomyelitis viruses and motor neurons, VZV and peripheral sensory neurons, and rabies virus and brainstem neurons. Yet others attack nonneuronal supporting glial cells; John Cunningham (JC) virus causing progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy is the prime example. For many of the rest, the
Document 5 (Title: Sexually Transmitted Infections -- Etiology): Male circumcision appears to significantly reduce the likelihood of acquiring several STIs, including human papillomavirus, genital herpes, and especially human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), where the infective risk decreases by 50% to 60%. [3] [4] The 7 most common STIs include 5 curable infections (chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, and trichomonas) and three incurable but treatable conditions (herpes simplex virus, HIV, and human papillomavirus (HPV). Of note, hepatitis B and hepatitis C can also be transmitted sexually but are more commonly spread through other forms of exposure. See each companion StatPearls reference for more detail. The most common and relevant STIs include the following:
Document 6 (Title: Infectious Complications of Blood Transfusion -- Issues of Concern -- Viruses): The first major viral infection recognized as causing transfusion-transmitted hepatitis was the hepatitis B virus (HBV). This was followed by “non-A” and “non-B” infection, which was later identified as hepatitis C virus (HCV), as well as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). [2]
Document 7 (Title: Papular Acrodermatitis -- Etiology): Ongoing studies have demonstrated that papular acrodermatitis of childhood can occur following a wide variety of viruses. These viruses include but are not limited to Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, coxsackievirus, adenovirus, influenza, enteroviruses, echovirus, hepatitis A virus, herpes simplex viruses, human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6), HIV, mumps, parainfluenza virus, parvovirus B19, poxviruses, respiratory syncytial virus, coronavirus, and rotavirus. [6] [7]
Document 8 (Title: Seroepidemiologic studies on the acquisition of antibodies to cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, and human immunodeficiency virus among general hospital patients and those attending a clinic for sexually transmitted diseases.): A total of 731 sera were collected from general hospital patients, divided into five distinct subgroups, and tested for the presence of immunoglobulin (IgG) to cytomegalovirus (CMV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV). The results indicate a high level of association between the two viruses, although HSV was found to be more prevalent in the earlier years of life, whereas CMV was acquired constantly throughout life. An increase in age was also accompanied by significantly higher antibody levels to both viruses. Individuals with antibody to HSV were significantly more likely to have antibodies to CMV, suggesting that these viruses are transmitted by similar routes (?saliva). In addition, 430 sera from 94 homosexual and 336 heterosexual males attending a clinic for sexually transmitted diseases were tested for antibody to CMV, HSV, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Homosexual males were more likely to have antibody to CMV and HIV than were heterosexuals, but no difference was seen for HSV antibodies. The levels of CMV-specific IgG were significantly raised in homosexuals, compared with heterosexuals, but again no difference was seen for HSV antibodies as in the general hospital patients, however, individuals with HSV antibodies were significantly more likely to possess antibodies to CMV. However, the additional association of CMV antibodies with a homosexual lifestyle suggests that an alternative route for acquisition of this virus exists (?semen). As raised levels of CMV antibodies, but not HSV antibodies, were found among homosexuals, this suggests that frequent CMV reinfections, rather than merely reactivation of latent herpes viruses, may be occurring.
Document 9 (Title: Hyperesthesia -- Etiology -- Peripheral): Infectious: human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV), human T-cell lymphotropic virus, herpes simplex virus, varicella-zoster virus, Ebstein-Barr virus, West Nile virus, hepatitis C virus, rabies virus, cytomegalovirus, diphtheria, Campylobacter jejuni, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium leprae, Brucella spp., Clostridium botulinum, and Borrelia burgdorferi.

Document 10 (Title: Herpes simplex virus): Herpes simplex virus 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2), also known by their taxonomical names Human alphaherpesvirus 1 and Human alphaherpesvirus 2, are two members of the human Herpesviridae family, a set of new viruses that produce viral infections in the majority of humans. Both HSV-1 (which produces most cold sores) and HSV-2 (which produces most genital herpes) are common and contagious. They can be spread when an infected person begins shedding the virus. About 67% of the world population under the age of 50 has HSV-1. In the United States, about 47.8% and 11.9% are believed to have HSV-1 and HSV-2, respectively. Because it can be transmitted through any intimate contact, it is one of the most common sexually transmitted infections.
Document 11 (Title: Sexual and reproductive health): Support for contraception is based on views such as reproductive rights, women's rights, and the necessity to prevent child abandonment and child poverty. The World Health Organization states that "By preventing unintended pregnancy, family planning /contraception prevents deaths of mothers and children". Sexually transmitted infection A sexually transmitted infection (STI) --previously known as a sexually transmitted disease (STD) or venereal disease (VD)-- is an infection that has a significant likelihood of transmission between humans by means of sexual activity. The CDC analyses the eight most common STIs: chlamydia, gonorrhea, hepatitis B virus (HBV), herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), human papillomavirus (HPV), syphilis, and trichomoniasis.
Document 12 (Title: Sexually transmitted viruses.): Human viruses known to be spread by sexual contact include herpes simplex viruses (HSV), papillomaviruses (HPV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus, and cytomegalovirus. Infections with the first three (HSV, HPV, and HIV) have reached epidemic proportions and pose global health concerns. Most of what we know about these human pathogens has been learned only recently, owing to the advent of DNA technologies and advances in culture techniques. In fact, our awareness of one virally transmitted venereal disease, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, dates to the early 1980s. This paper touches on various aspects of the biology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and, where applicable, oncogenicity of these agents, as well as current treatments and vaccine initiatives.
Document 13 (Title: Herpes virus): Herpes virus may refer to: Any member of the large family of DNA viruses known as Herpesviridae Human herpesviruses, nine types of herpesviruses that can cause diseases in humans Herpes simplex virus 1 and 2, responsible for herpes simplex infections Human alphaherpesvirus 3, also called varicella-zoster virus, responsible for chickenpox and shingles Human gammaherpesvirus 4, or Epstein–Barr virus, one of the most common viruses which can cause various diseases Human betaherpesvirus 5 Roseolovirus, a genus that includes three human herpesviruses: Human herpesvirus 6, the collective name for Human betaherpesvirus 6A and Human betaherpesvirus 6B Human betaherpesvirus 7 Human gammaherpesvirus 8, or Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus
Document 14 (Title: Herpes simplex virus): Both viruses may also be transmitted vertically during childbirth, also termed "Nongential herpes simplex virus". However, the risk of infection transmission is minimal if the mother has no symptoms or exposed blisters during delivery. The risk is considerable when the mother is infected with the virus for the first time during late pregnancy. Contrary to popular myths, herpes cannot be transmitted from surfaces such as toilet seats because the herpes virus begins to die immediately after leaving the body. Herpes simplex viruses can affect areas of skin exposed to contact with an infected person (although shaking hands with an infected person does not transmit this disease). An example of this is herpetic whitlow, which is a herpes infection on the fingers. This was a common affliction of dental surgeons prior to the routine use of gloves when conducting treatment on patients. Infection of HSV-2 increases the risk of acquiring HIV. Virology Viral structure
Document 15 (Title: Pediatrics_Nelson): Many infections that are not traditionally considered STIs are sexually transmissible, including those caused by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), human T cell leukemia viruses types I and II, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, human herpes virus (HHV-6, HHV-7), hepatitis B virus, molluscum contagiosum virus, and Sarcoptes scabiei. The presence of any STI suggests behavior that increases risk for HIV (see Chapter 125), and HIV counseling and testing should be provided to all adolescents with STIs. Acquisition of gonorrhea, syphilis, HSV-2, and trichomoniasis in prepubertal children beyond the neonatal period indicates sexual contact and signifies the need to investigate for possible sexual abuse (see Chapter 22); diagnosis of STIs in infants can represent abuse or perinatal acquisition. The association of sexual abuse with vulvovaginitis and genital HPV infection, which may result from skin or genital HPV types, is less certain.
