Common side effects include high blood pressure, pain at the site of the injection, vomiting, and fever.

        "content": "The standard treatment of Lewisite (dichloro(2-chlorovinyl)arsine) poisoning is by chelation with BAL (British anti-Lewisite, dimercaptopropanol). The present study investigated the effect of BAL treatment on the distribution of arsenic after Lewisite administration. Lewisite was administered subcutaneously at the LD10 and LD40 of the compound. Without BAL treatment arsenic was eliminated with a half-life in blood of between 55 and 75 hr and a blood clearance of 120 ml/hr/kg. Arsenic had a large volume of distribution of several liters per kilogram, indicating extensive distribution in tissues. The highest tissue concentrations, more than seven times blood concentrations, were found in the liver, lung, and kidneys. These organs maintained an approximately constant concentration ratio with blood during the sampling period. Concentrations in tissues with a blood-to-tissue barrier, such as the brain and the spinal cord, rose between 4 and 96 hr while blood concentrations declined more than fourfold over the same time period. BAL treatment by four equal, maximally tolerated doses over 12 hr substantially reduced arsenic concentrations in blood and tissues. For example, at 24 hr the concentrations in brain and liver (target organs for arsenic toxicity) were reduced by 65 to 89% over the range of Lewisite doses administered. The total exposure of brain and spinal cord was reduced by more than two-thirds by BAL treatment. Further, the blood clearance of arsenic was increased. BAL treatment enhanced the elimination of arsenic in two ways: by decreasing the tissue-to-blood partitioning which mobilizes arsenic into the blood stream, and by increasing the clearance of arsenic.",

Both DMPS and DMSA were significantly (p less than or equal to 0.05) more effective in mice treated 0.5 min after the poisoning if compared to BAL on an equimolar level. The highest potency ratio (PR) (LD50 with treatment/LD50 without treatment) was found in animals injected with DMSA (PR = 8.6). The corresponding value for DMPS was 4.2, and for BAL 2.1, respectively. In animals treated 30 min after poisoning the efficacy of DMPS (PR = 2.6) was similar to the efficacy of DMSA 2.4, both being only slightly superior to BAL 2.0. DMPS and DMSA were found to be much less toxic than BAL. The LD50 of arsenic was 0.057 mmol/kg. The efficacy of BAL, DMPS, and DMSA in reducing the tissue content of arsenic following acute As2O3 poisoning was investigated in mice (n = 6/group) and guinea pigs (n = 3-4/group). The animals were injected s.c. with 0.043 mmol/kg As2O3 (containing a tracer dose of 74As(III)). Thirty minutes later the antidotes were administered i.p. (0.7 mmol/kg). From 2 to 4 h after As2O3 poisoning bile was collected from guinea pigs. Four h after As2O3 injection the content of 74As in blood, liver, kidneys, spleen, heart, lungs, brain, testes, skeletal muscle, and skin in mice and guinea pigs was measured.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
        "contents": "Efficacy of various dithiol compounds in acute As2O3 poisoning in mice. The efficacy of DL-dimercaptopropanol (British Anti-Lewisite, BAL), DL-dimercaptopropanesulfonate (DMPS), and meso-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) was compared in reducing the acute As2O3 toxicity in mice. Mice were treated with a single equimolar dose of a dithiol compound (0.7 mmol/kg i.p.) 0.5 or 30 min after the s.c. injection of various doses of As2O3. Both DMPS and DMSA were significantly (p less than or equal to 0.05) more effective in mice treated 0.5 min after the poisoning if compared to BAL on an equimolar level. The highest potency ratio (PR) (LD50 with treatment/LD50 without treatment) was found in animals injected with DMSA (PR = 8.6). The corresponding value for DMPS was 4.2, and for BAL 2.1, respectively. In animals treated 30 min after poisoning the efficacy of DMPS (PR = 2.6) was similar to the efficacy of DMSA 2.4, both being only slightly superior to BAL 2.0. DMPS and DMSA were found to be much less toxic than BAL. The LD50 of arsenic was 0.057 mmol/kg.

        "content": "British antilewisite (2,3-dimercaptopropanol; BAL) has long been used as an arsenic antidote, but its therapeutic efficacy is limited by its inherent toxicity. We synthesized two less toxic derivatives of BAL and investigated their potential as antidotes to organic arsenic. The new compounds, 2,3-dithioerythritol (DTE) and 2,2-dimethyl-4-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3-dithiolane (isopropylidene derivative of BAL), react readily with phenyldichloroarsine (PDA) to yield the expected corresponding cyclic 1,3-dithioarsolanes. The BAL derivatives were compared to BAL in terms of their cytotoxicity and their ability to rescue PDA-poisoned mouse lymphoma cells in culture. The dithiolane was not a good antidote in the cultured cell system. In contrast, DTE was less toxic than BAL or DMSA and was superior at improving cell survival in PDA-exposed cells.",
