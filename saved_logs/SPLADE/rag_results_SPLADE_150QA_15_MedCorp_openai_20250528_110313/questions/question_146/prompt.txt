Document 1 (Title: Isolation of keratinophilic fungi from the dust of ferry boats and trains in Italy.): The occurrence of fungi of the genera Epidermophyton, Microsporum, Trichophyton and Chrysosporium in dust collected from 10 ferry boats and 11 railway cars in Italy was studied. Ferry boats: 101 colonies of fungi were isolated. Of the dermatophytes, E. floccosum represented 2.0% of all the colonies isolated, M. canis 3.0%, M. gypseum 5.0% and Tr. mentagrophytes represented 2.0%. E. floccosum was isolated from 2 ferry boats, M. canis from 3, M. gypseum from 4 and Tr. mentagrophytes from 2. Only two ferry boats appeared to be free of pathogenic fungi. Of all the species isolated, Chr. pannorum was the most numerous (45.4%). In all five species of Chrysosporium were isolated. Railway cars: The final destination of the trains, coming from various cities, was Rome's Termini Station. 336 strains were isolated. The following species were found: E. floccosum 3%, Tr. mentagrophytes 4.8%, Tr. tonsurans 0.3%, Tr. ajelloi 0.6%, Trichophyton spp. 3%, M. canis 5% and M. gypseum 1.5%. Seven different species of Chrysosporium were isolated. Chr. pannorum was the most numerous one (71% of all). Regarding the occurrence of dermatophytes, E. floccosum was isolated from 8 of the 11 trains examined, M. canis from 10, M. gypseum from 4, Tr. mentagrophytes from 8 and Tr. tonsurans from only 1 of the trains. All of the trains were positive for pathogenic fungi, ranging from a minimum of 2 species to a maximum of 4.
Document 2 (Title: Dermatophyte): Trichophyton: rubrum, tonsurans, mentagrophytes, verrucosum, and schoenlenii Microsporum: canis, audouinii, and gypseum Epidermophyton: floccosum About 76% of the dermatophyte species isolated from humans are Trichophyton rubrum. 27% are Trichophyton mentagrophytes 7% are Trichophyton verrucosum 3% are Trichophyton tonsurans Infrequently isolated (less than 1%) are Epidermophyton floccosum, Microsporum audouinii, Microsporum canis, Microsporum equinum, Microsporum nanum, Microsporum versicolor, Trichophyton equinum, Trichophyton kanei, Trichophyton raubitschekii, and Trichophyton violaceum. The mixture of species is quite different in domesticated animals and pets (see ringworm for details). Epidemiology Since dermatophytes are found worldwide, infections by these fungi are extremely common. Infections occur more in males than in females, as the predominantly female hormone, progesterone, inhibits the growth of dermatophyte fungi.
Document 3 (Title: Tinea Manuum -- Etiology): Tinea manuum is caused by dermatophytes, the most common of which worldwide is Trichophyton rubrum . However, different etiologic organisms have been reported in various geographical locations, including: [2] Trichophyton mentagrophytes [3] Epidermophyton floccosum Trichophyton verrucosum Trichophyton interdigitale Microsporum canis
Document 4 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): The topical imidazoles, which include clotrimazole, econazole, ketoconazole, luliconazole, miconazole, oxiconazole, sertaconazole, and sulconazole, have a wide range of activity against dermatophytes (Epidermophyton, Microsporum, and Trichophyton) and yeasts, including Candida albicans and Pityrosporum orbiculare (see Chapter 48). Miconazole (Monistat, Micatin) is available for topical application as a cream or lotion and as vaginal cream or suppositories for use in vulvovaginal candidiasis. Clotrimazole (Lotrimin, Mycelex) is available for topical application to the skin as a cream or lotion and as vaginal cream and tablets for use in vulvovaginal candidiasis. Efinaconazole (Jublia) is available as a 10% solution for the treatment of onychomycosis of the toenails. Daily application to affected toenails should be continued for 48 weeks.
Document 5 (Title: Onychomycosis -- Etiology): The most frequent cause of onychomycosis is Trichophyton rubrum, but other dermatophytes, including Trichophyton mentagrophytes and Epidermophyton floccosum, can also cause it. The dermatophytes are identified in 90% of the toenail and 50% of fingernail onychomycosis. [5] Candida albicans cases account for 2% of onychomycosis, especially in fingernails. Nondermatophytic mold onychomycosis is cultured primarily from toenails. Examples of these saprophytic molds include Fusarium, Aspergillus, Acremonium, Scytalidium, and Scopulariopsis brevicaulis, [6] accounting for about 8% of nail infections. [7]
Document 6 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): See Chap. 156. Dermatophytes are fungi that infect skin, hair, and nails and include members of the genera Trichophyton, Microsporum, and Epidermophyton (Chap. 243). Tinea corporis, or infection of the relatively hairless skin of the body (glabrous skin), may have a variable appearance depending on the extent of the associated inflammatory reaction. Typical infections consist of erythematous, scaly plaques, with an annular appearance that accounts for the common name “ringworm.” Deep inflammatory nodules or granulomas occur in CHAPTER 71 Eczema, Psoriasis, Cutaneous Infections, Acne, and Other Common Skin Disorders
Document 7 (Title: Tinea Barbae -- Etiology): Transmission of dermatophytes to humans occurs via direct contact with infected humans (anthropophilic), soil (geophilic), or infected animals (zoophilic). [7] Research has revealed that tinea barbae is caused exclusively by zoophilic and anthropophilic dermatophytes. [1] Trichophyton verrucosum , Trichophyton mentagrophytes , and Trichophyton rubrum are the most commonly reported causative organisms. [1] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] Other documented causative organisms include Trichophyton violaceum , Trichophyton megninii , Trichophyton schoenleinii , Trichophyton tonsurans , Trichophyton interdigitale , Trichophyton ernacei ,  Microsporum canis , Microsporum nanum , Mycroscporum gypseum , and Epidermophyton floccosum. [1] However, infections from Trichophyton megninii (endemic in Sardinia, Sicily, and Portugal) and Trichophyton schoenleinii (endemic in Eurasia, Africa, and Brazil) may also occur, particularly in endemic regions. T rubrum and T violaceum are the most common anthropophilic dermatophytes responsible for tinea barbae.
Document 8 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): Griseofulvin, effective orally against dermatophyte infections caused by Epidermophyton, Microsporum, and Trichophyton, is ineffective against Candida and P orbiculare. Griseofulvin’s mechanism of antifungal action is not fully understood, but it is active only against growing cells. Following oral administration of 1 g of microsize griseofulvin, drug can be detected in the stratum corneum 4–8 hours later. Reducing the particle size of the medication greatly increases drug absorption. Formulations that contain the smallest particle size are labeled “ultramicrosize.” Ultramicrosize griseofulvin achieves bioequivalent plasma levels with half the dose of microsize drug. In addition, solubilizing griseofulvin in polyethylene glycol enhances absorption even further. Microsized griseofulvin is available as 250 mg and 500 mg tablets, and ultramicrosized drug as 125 mg, 165 mg, 250 mg, and 330 mg tablets and as 250 mg capsules.
Document 9 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): They are available as 1% creams and other forms for the topical treatment of dermatophytosis, to be applied on a twice-daily dosing schedule for 1–2 weeks. Adverse reactions include local irritation, burning sensation, and erythema. Contact with mucous membranes should be avoided. Butenafine hydrochloride (Mentax) is a benzylamine that is structurally related to the allylamines. As with the allylamines, butenafine inhibits the epoxidation of squalene, thus blocking the synthesis of ergosterol, an essential component of fungal cell membranes. Butenafine is available as a 1% cream to be applied once daily for the treatment of superficial dermatophytosis. Tolnaftate is a synthetic antifungal compound effective topically against dermatophyte infections caused by Epidermophyton, Microsporum, and Trichophyton. It is also active against P orbiculare but not against Candida.
Document 10 (Title: Dermatophyte): Sexual reproduction Dermatophytes reproduce sexually by either of two modes, heterothallism or homothallism. In heterothallic species, interaction of two individuals with compatible mating types are required in order for sexual reproduction to occur. In contrast, homothallic fungi are self-fertile and can complete a sexual cycle without a partner of opposite mating type. Both types of sexual reproduction involve meiosis. Frequency of species In North America and Europe, the nine most common dermatophyte species are: Trichophyton: rubrum, tonsurans, mentagrophytes, verrucosum, and schoenlenii Microsporum: canis, audouinii, and gypseum Epidermophyton: floccosum
Document 11 (Title: Prevalence of superficial mycoses in the Aosta Valley region of Italy from 1984 to 1989.): This report represents the results of the culture tests for fungi carried out in the Aosta Valley region of Italy from 1984 to 1989. The pathological material consisted of cutaneous scales, hair and nails. It was possible to identify 91.8% of the isolates: out of these, 36.1% were dermatophytes, 21% were Aspergillus spp, 15.6% Deuteromycetes, 15% yeasts and 4.1% members of the family Mucoraceae. The resulting data indicate that Microsporum canis was the most wide-spread species (73.7%) among the isolated dermatophytes and keratinophilic fungi (Trichophyton rubrum, T. mentagrophytes, Epidermophyton floccosum and Scopulariopsis brevicaulis): 87.5% were isolated from hair and 65.9% from the glabrous skin. The high prevalence of M. canis as the cause of dermatomycoses is discussed. Lastly the use made of the Regional Hospital's Mycology Department by health workers is discussed.
Document 12 (Title: Isolation of dermatophytes, Candida species and systemic fungi from dermatologic specimens in Montréal, 1963 to 1973.): Of 10 057 specimens of scrapings from skin, nails and scalp examined for dermatophytes, yeasts, pityriasis versicolor and systemic mycoses between 1963 and 1973, 30.4 percent were positive for fungi. Skin produced the highest proportion (68.6 percent) of positive scrapings, scalp the lowest (4.2 percent). Trichophyton rubrum was the predominant species (23.6 percent); of lesser prevalence were Microsporum canis (9.3 percent), T. mentagrophytes (8.4 percent) and Epidermophyton floccosum (4.8 percent). Double infections were encountered on 102 occasions; T. rubrum and Candida parapsilosis were the most frequent cohabiting species. The introduction in 1966 of periodic acid-Schiff staining for routine examination of scrapings resulted in better diagnostic results, particularly in the case of culturally nonproductive specimens and cases of pityriasis versicolor. Blastomyces dermatitidis and Cryptococcus neoformans were isolated from two patients in the course of routine investigation for dermatophytes.
Document 13 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): DERMATOPHYTE (MOLD) INFECTIONS Etiologic Agents The molds that cause skin infections in humans include the genera Trichophyton, Microsporum, and Epidermophyton. These organisms, which are not components of the normal skin flora, 1357 can live within the keratinized structures of the skin—hence the term dermatophytes.
Document 14 (Title: Onychomycosis): Dermatophytes When onychomycosis is due to a dermatophyte infection, it is termed tinea unguium. Trichophyton rubrum is the most common dermatophyte involved in onychomycosis. Other dermatophytes that may be involved are T. interdigitale, Epidermophyton floccosum, T. violaceum, Microsporum gypseum, T. tonsurans, and T. soudanense. A common outdated name that may still be reported by medical laboratories is Trichophyton mentagrophytes for T. interdigitale. The name T. mentagrophytes is now restricted to the agent of favus skin infection of the mouse; though this fungus may be transmitted from mice and their danders to humans, it generally infects skin and not nails.
Document 15 (Title: Tinea Capitis -- Pathophysiology): Dermatophytes are a common cause of infection in humans. Once acquired, the fungus grows downwards in the stratum corneum and invades the keratin. The infected hair eventually becomes brittle and then break. Immunosuppression may lead to impaired hair shaft growth and strength leading to easier colonization. Other associated diseases include: Diabetes mellitus Prolonged steroid use Cancer Immunosuppressant medications Anemia It is worth mentioning that in HIV, the risk is not increasing due to competitive colonization with Malassezia. Hair will typically get infected in one of three principal ways: 1) Endothrix: where the fungi affect the hair shaft - an example of this type: Trichophyton tonsurans 2) Ectothrix: where the fungi affect the outer sheath root - an example of this type: Microsporum canis 3) Favus: where there is an inflammatory reaction, crusting or scutula, and hair loss - an example of this type: Trichophyton schoenleinii [4]
