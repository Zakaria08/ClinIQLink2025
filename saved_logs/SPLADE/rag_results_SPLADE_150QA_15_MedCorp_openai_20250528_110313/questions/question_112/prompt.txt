Toxicities: Myelosuppression immunosuppression (suppress CD4+ cells) puts patients at risk for opportunistic infections D) Pyrimidine analogs – fluorouracil (5-FU), capecitabine (prodrug of 5-FU).
Document 2 (Title: Biochemistry_Lippinco): 28.2, p. 378), an enzyme that is inhibited by folate analogs such as methotrexate. By decreasing the supply of THF, these drugs not only inhibit purine synthesis (see Fig. 22.7), but, by preventing methylation of dUMP to dTMP, they also decrease the availability of this essential component of DNA. DNA synthesis is inhibited and cell growth slowed. Thus, these drugs are used to treat cancer. [Note: Acyclovir (a purine analog) and AZT (3′-azido-3′-deoxythymidine, a pyrimidine analog) are used to treat infections of herpes simplex virus and human immunodeficiency virus, respectively. Each inhibits the viral DNA polymerase.] F. Pyrimidine salvage and degradation
Document 3 (Title: Methotrexate): Mechanism of action Methotrexate is an antimetabolite of the antifolate type. It is thought to affect cancer and rheumatoid arthritis by two different pathways. For cancer, methotrexate competitively inhibits dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), an enzyme that participates in the tetrahydrofolate synthesis. The affinity of methotrexate for DHFR is about 1000-fold that of folate. DHFR catalyses the conversion of dihydrofolate to the active tetrahydrofolate. Folic acid is needed for the de novo synthesis of the nucleoside thymidine, required for DNA synthesis. Also, folate is essential for purine and pyrimidine base biosynthesis, so synthesis will be inhibited. Methotrexate, therefore, inhibits the synthesis of DNA, RNA, thymidylates, and proteins.
Document 4 (Title: Folate analog nonsubstrates and inhibitors of folylpolyglutamate synthetase as potential cancer chemotherapy drugs.): Folate monoglutamates and classical antifols such as methotrexate (MTX) are converted intracellularly to poly-gamma-glutamyl forms by folylpolyglutamate synthetase (FPGS). Folylpolyglutamates are absolutely essential for cell survival and proliferation. MTX polyglutamates are strongly implicated in the cytotoxic mechanism of this drug. Two new types of antifol could be targeted toward polyglutamate synthesis. One type would be structurally analogous to a folate monoglutamate or MTX, except it would not form polyglutamates. In the case of a folate, this analog might induce cellular deficiency by displacing natural folates. In the case of MTX, the analog might have a therapeutic advantage if MTX polyglutamates are involved primarily in host toxicity. The second approach is through direct inhibitors of FPGS. Two relevant MTX analogs have been synthesized and tested: 4-amino-10-methylpteroyl-4-fluoroglutamate does not form polyglutamates or does so extremely poorly; the second, 4-amino-10-methylpteroyl-2,5-diaminopentanoate, is an inhibitor of mammalian FPGS, as predicted from the work of Shane and co-workers with reduced pteroyl-2,5-diaminopentanoate.
Document 5 (Title: Folate analogues. 34. Synthesis and antitumor activity of non-polyglutamylatable inhibitors of dihydrofolate reductase.): Five analogues of methotrextate (MTX), 10-deazaaminopterin (10-DAM), and 10-ethyl-10-deazaaminopterin (10-EDAM) in which the glutamate moiety was replaced by either a gamma-methyleneglutamate or beta-hydroxyglutamate were synthesized and evaluated for their antifolate activity. These analogous are 4-amino-4-deoxy-N10-methylpteroyl-beta-hydroxyglutamic acid (1), 4-amino-4-deoxy-10-deazapteroyl-beta-hydroxyglutamic acid (2), 4-amino-4-deoxy-N10-methylpteroyl-gamma-methyleneglutamic acid (3, MMTX), 4-amino-4-deoxy-10-deazapteroyl-gamma-methyleneglutamic acid (4, MDAM), and 4-amino-4-deoxy-10-ethyl-10-deazapteroyl-gamma-methyleneglutamic acid (5, MEDAM). None of these compounds were metabolized to the respective polyglutamate derivative as judged by their inability to serve as substrates for CCRF-CEM human leukemia cell folylpolyglutamate synthetase (FPGS) in vitro. All compounds inhibited recombinant human-dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) at nearly equivalent magnitude as MTX. Growth-inhibition studies with H35 hepatoma, Manca human lymphoma, and CCRF-CEM human leukemia cells established greater cytotoxic effects with compounds 3-5 than with compounds 1 and 2. gamma-Methyleneglutamate derivatives 3-5 were transported to H35 hepatoma cells better than MTX or beta-hydroxyglutamate derivatives 1 and 2. Compound 3 was 2.5 times better than MTX in competing with folinic acid transport in H35 hepatoma cells. Compound 1 did not have a significant inhibitory effect on folinic acid transport even at 50 microM under identical conditions. The IC50 for compound 1 against H35-hepatoma cell growth was 8.5-fold higher than MTX. Compounds with the gamma-methyleneglutamate moiety (3-5) exhibited almost equal or lower IC50 values than MTX against the growth of CCRF-CEM human leukemia cells. These studies show that on continuous exposure, the non-polyglutamylatable inhibitors DHFR (3-5) can exhibit superior antifolate activity compared to the polyglutamylatable methotrexate, presumably due to their enhanced transport to these cell lines. Compounds 3-5 appear to be excellent models to study the role of polyglutamylation of antifolates in antitumor activity and host toxicity.
Document 6 (Title: Conformationally restrained, chiral (phenylisopropyl)amino-substituted pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidines and purines with selectivity for adenosine A1 and A2 receptors.): Two modes of tethering a chiral (phenylisopropyl)amino substituent in pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidines and purines have been explored. One mode gave (S)-2,7-dihydro-7-phenyl-2-(phenylmethyl)-5- propoxy-3H-imidazo[1,2-c]pyrazolo-[4,3-e]pyrimidine (12a) and its corresponding R-enantiomer 12b, which were selective for A2 and A1 adenosine receptors, respectively. The corresponding diimidazo[1,2-c:4',5'-e]pyrimidines 12e and 12f were analogously selective. This is the first example where a single chiral recognition unit provides enantiomers with opposite selectivities for adenosine receptors. The second mode gave (2S-trans)-2,7-dihydro-2-methyl-3,7-diphenyl-5- propoxy-3H-imidazo[1,2-c]-pyrazolo[4,3-e]pyrimidine (12c) and its corresponding R-enantiomer 12d. Compounds 12c and 12d were significantly less potent than 12a and 12b at A1 receptors, and were nonselective.

Document 8 (Title: Folate transporter 1): Folate transporter 1 is a protein which in humans is encoded by the SLC19A1 gene. Function Transport of folate compounds into mammalian cells can occur via receptor-mediated (see folate receptor 1) or carrier-mediated mechanisms. A functional coordination between these 2 mechanisms has been proposed to be the method of folate uptake in certain cell types. Methotrexate (MTX) is an antifolate chemotherapeutic agent that is actively transported by the carrier-mediated uptake system. RFC1 plays a role in maintaining intracellular concentrations of folate. SLC19A1 has also been shown to transport the immune second messenger 2'3'-cGAMP. Clinical significance
Document 9 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): Pralatrexate is a 10-deaza-aminopterin antifolate analog, and as in the case of MTX, it is transported into the cell via the reduced folate carrier (RFC) and requires activation by FPGS to yield higher polyglutamate forms. This molecule was originally designed to be a more potent substrate for the RFC-1 carrier protein and to serve as an improved substrate for FPGS. This agent inhibits DHFR, inhibits enzymes involved in de novo purine nucleotide biosynthesis, and also inhibits TS. Pralatrexate is presently approved for use in the treatment of relapsed or refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma. Consistent with other antifolate analogs, pralatrexate is mainly excreted in the urine, and dose modification is required in renal dysfunction. The main adverse effects include myelosuppression, skin rash, mucositis, diarrhea, and fatigue. As with pemetrexed, vitamin supplementation with folic acid and vitamin B12 appears to reduce the toxicities associated with pralatrexate, without interfering
Document 10 (Title: Glutamylation of methotrexate in hepatoma cells in vitro: regulation and the development of specific inhibitors.): Methotrexate is glutamylated in cultured hepatoma cells to derivatives that contain a total of 2 to 5 gamma-glutamyl residues. The rate of polyglutamate formation and extent of accumulation are saturable with respect to both medium concentration of methotrexate and time. Maximal rates of glutamylation and accumulation of methotrexate polyglutamates at steady state occur at approximately 10 microM extracellular methotrexate. Inclusion of physiologic concentrations of insulin or removal of folate from the medium each cause a doubling of the rate of glutamylation, and these effects are additive. Insulin and folate restriction also enhance the accumulation of methotrexate polyglutamates. In combination they result in a doubling in the intracellular methotrexate polyglutamate pool at steady state and a shift in the polyglutamate distribution to longer-chain-length species. The importance of the longer-chain-length polyglutamates is apparent from the 6-hr retention of the polyglutamate species: Glu2, 15%; Glu3, 21%; Glu4, 50%; and Glu5, 83%. In probing the glutamylation reaction, a new series of inhibitors have been initiated. These are based upon replacing the incoming glutamate with 4-fluoroglutamate or synthesizing methotrexate with the glutamate replaced by 4-fluoroglutamate. The 4-fluoroglutamyl analogs of methotrexate are effective inhibitors of dihydrofolate reductase but cannot be glutamylated. They will be utilized to probe the role of glutamylation in antifolate activity and folate metabolism.
Document 11 (Title: Serotonin–norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitor): (+)-CPCA ("nocaine") is the 3R,4S piperidine stereoisomer of (phenyltropane based) RTI-31. It is non addictive, although this might be due to it being a NDRI, not a SNDRI. The β-naphthyl analog of "Nocaine" is a SNDRI though in the case of both the SS and RR enantiomers. Consider the piperidine analogs of brasofensine and tesofensine. These were prepared by NeuroSearch (In Denmark) by the chemists Peter Moldt (2002), and Frank Wätjen (2004–2009). There are four separate isomers to consider (SS, RR, S/R and R/S). This is because there are two chiral carbon sites of asymmetry (means 2 to the power of n isomers to consider where n is the number of chiral carbons). They are therefore a diastereo(iso)meric pair of racemers. With a racemic pair of diastereomers, there is still the question of syn (cis) or anti (trans). In the case of the phenyltropanes, although there are four chiral carbons, there are only eight possible isomers to consider. This is based on the fact that the compound is
Document 12 (Title: Pemetrexed -- Indications): Pemetrexed is an antifolate metabolic inhibitor approved by the U.S. Food Drug Administration (FDA) in 2004 for the treatment of malignant pleural mesothelioma. [1] [2] Pemetrexed was developed by Edward C. Taylor and his team at Princeton University, who first synthesized lometrexol, the prototypical de novo purine antimetabolite. [3] However, lometrexol's structure was unstable, requiring the C-6 chiral center to be replaced with a pyrrolopyrimidine ring, creating a new molecule: N-[4-[2-(2-amino-4,7-dihydro-4-oxo-1H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-5-yl)ethyl]benzoyl]-L-glutamic acid. Eli Lilly and Company brought this medication to the market and gave it a brand name. [4] Pemetrexed is an antineoplastic agent that can be given as a single agent or as part of combination therapy.
Document 13 (Title: Strictosidine synthase): range of substrate specificity. For instance, mutation of valine-208 to alanine allows strictosidine synthase to generate 5-methyl and 5-methoxystrictosidines from its tryptamine analogs while retaining chirality. Also, binding with various secologanin analogs with the same stereoselectivity as that of 3-alpha(S)-strictosidine can be achieved through the mutation of aspartate-177 to alanine, permitting the synthesis of a wider range of possible alkaloid compounds for further drug discovery investigations.
