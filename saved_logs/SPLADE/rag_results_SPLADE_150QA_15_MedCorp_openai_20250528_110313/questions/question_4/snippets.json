        "content": "Pulmonary edema (PE), also known as pulmonary congestion, is liquid accumulation in the tissue and air spaces of the lungs. It leads to impaired gas exchange and may cause respiratory failure. It is due to either failure of the left ventricle of the heart to remove blood adequately from the pulmonary circulation (cardiogenic pulmonary edema), or an injury to the lung tissue or blood vessels of the lung (non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema). Treatment is focused on three aspects: firstly improving respiratory function, secondly, treating the underlying cause, and thirdly avoiding further damage to the lung. Pulmonary edema, especially when sudden (acute), can lead to respiratory failure or cardiac arrest due to hypoxia. It is a cardinal feature of congestive heart failure. The term edema is from the Greek (oid\u0113ma, \"swelling\"), from \u03bf\u1f30\u03b4\u03ad\u03c9 (oid\u00e9\u014d, \"(I) swell\").",

Clinically, recurrent episodes of disseminated intravascular coagulation, including pulmonary thrombosis, were thought to be superimposed to Eisenmenger syndrome associated with toxemia of pregnancy. Anticoagulant and fibrinolytic treatments were tried, but their effectiveness was limited by hemorrhagic diathesis. She died of respiratory and circulatory failure after delivery of a moribund baby.

        "contents": "An autopsied case of Eisenmenger syndrome complicated by recurrent thromboembolic phenomena in postpartal period. Dyspnea, back pain, edema, and cyanosis developed suddenly in a 23-year-old woman during the last trimester of her first pregnancy. Although she had been noticed to have the enlarged heart and exertional shortness of breath to a slight degree, she had been apparently in good condition without any significant heart murmurs. Clinically, recurrent episodes of disseminated intravascular coagulation, including pulmonary thrombosis, were thought to be superimposed to Eisenmenger syndrome associated with toxemia of pregnancy. Anticoagulant and fibrinolytic treatments were tried, but their effectiveness was limited by hemorrhagic diathesis. She died of respiratory and circulatory failure after delivery of a moribund baby. Autopsy revealed Eisenmenger complex (a defect in the membranous portion of the interventricular septum and pulmonary vascular disease) and many fresh hemmorrhages in both lungs with a lot of new and organized thrombi. Fresh thrombi were also seen in the heart, the pancreas and the kidneys. The high peripartal mortality in Eisenmenger syndrome could be attributed to pulmonary thrombosis, which may be related to DIC, as well as to peripartal changes in circulatory function.",
