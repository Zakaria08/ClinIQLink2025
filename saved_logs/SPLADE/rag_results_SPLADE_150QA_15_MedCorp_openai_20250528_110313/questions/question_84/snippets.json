The waveforms of Doppler signals were divided into two types: the pulsatile wave, which was detected from hepatocellular carcinoma (in 35 of the 48 with Doppler signals) and metastatic liver cancer (in all seven with positive signals), and the continuous wave, which was seen from hepatocellular carcinoma (41 out of 48) and haemangioma (in all four with signals). In six patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who underwent transcatheter arterial embolization, the pulsatile wave detected before therapy disappeared immediately thereafter and it is possible that this type of wave originates from tumour vessels.
