Special consideration should be paid to puncture wounds in areas like the hands, which have multiple small compartments. Some groups have found that as long as wounds are properly irrigated and cleansed with povidone iodine solution while a short course of antibiotics is prescribed, there is no difference in infection rates in dog bite wounds closed primarily.62Rabies in domestic animals in the United States is rare, and most cases are contracted from bat bites. In developing countries, dog bites remain the most common source of rabies. Management of this is beyond the scope of this
Document 2 (Title: Animal Bites -- Treatment / Management): All wounds require extensive irrigation. Provide appropriate pain management before exploration, irrigation, or debridement of the wounds. The patient’s tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis status should be updated if necessary. For uncomplicated dog bites, the patient should be educated on the risk/benefit of closure versus healing by secondary intention and the decision made with the provider. If the patient presents delayed from the initial bite, the risks of closing the wound almost certainly outweigh the cosmetic benefits of closure. If the wound is closed, the patient should be discharged with a week’s course of amoxicillin-clavulanate.
Document 3 (Title: Asplenia): Additional measures Surgical and dental procedures - Antibiotic prophylaxis may be required before certain surgical or dental procedures. Animal bites - adequate antibiotic cover is required after even minor dog or other animal bites. Asplenic patients are particularly susceptible to infection by capnocytophaga canimorsus and should receive a five-day course of amoxicillin/clavulanate (erythromycin in patients allergic to penicillin). Tick bites - Babesiosis is a rare tickborne infection. Patients should check themselves or have themselves inspected for tick bites if they are in an at-risk situation. Presentation with fever, fatigue, and haemolytic anaemia requires diagnostic confirmation by identifying the parasites within red blood cells on blood film and by specific serology. Quinine (with or without clindamycin) is usually an effective treatment.
Document 4 (Title: Animal Bites -- Treatment / Management): Complicated dog bites should be stabilized and referred for the appropriate consultation service. Cat bites deeper than superficial, so thorough irrigation under local anesthesia is needed, and the wound is left open. The patient should be discharged with a week of amoxicillin-clavulanate and given strict wound care precautions. All bites to the hands or feet, bites in immunocompromised individuals, bites that already show signs of infection, and bites with a puncture characteristic require treatment with amoxicillin-clavulanate. Second-line therapy for patients with penicillin allergies is doxycycline or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) plus metronidazole or clindamycin. The appropriate consult service should see patients with extensive local infection; patients with evidence of disseminated infection should be treated with broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics and admitted for further care.

Document 5 (Title: Epidemiologic and clinical aspects of animal bite injuries.): During 1975, 332 animal bite injuries accounted for 1.2% of all surgical problems treated at the UCLA Hospital Emergency Department. Data on 307 bite injuries were available and analyzed for environmental, animal, human, interaction, and clinical factors. More than half of the dog bites and almost three fourths of the cat bites-scratches happened at or near the victims' homes. Dog bites were almost twice as common among men, while cat bites-scratches were twice as common among women. Of the incidents in which ownership information was available, 85% of dog bites and 80% of cat bites-scratches were from an animal belonging to the victim, his family or friends, or another known person. Forty-three percent of dog bites, and 52% of cat bites-scratches were provoked, that is, happened while the victim was interacting with the animal. Of bites of the head and/or neck, 38% injured the upper lip; 17% of dog bites injured the eye or adjacent tissues; 48% were in children less than ten-years-old. On fifth of cat bites-scratches involved the head and/or neck, 60% of these injured orbital or periorbital tissues. Over 2% of patients were hospitalized. Five percent of dog bite victims and 29% of cat bite-scratch victims returned with complications, mostly cellulitis or lymphangitis. Pasteurella multocida was the most common pathogen cultured, as evidenced by the 50% and 80% culture-positive rates for dog and cat bite-scratches respectively in this series.
Document 6 (Title: Prophylactic oral antibiotics for low-risk dog bite wounds.): The use of prophylactic antibiotics in the initial treatment of noninfected dog bite wounds is controversial. All patients with noninfected dog bite wounds who presented to our emergency department (ED) over a two-year period were considered for entry into a randomized prospective study. Patients were excluded from the study if they had any high-risk criteria for infection: puncture wounds, hand or foot wounds, wounds greater than 12 hours old, a history of immunocompromising disorders, or the use of immunosuppressive drugs. Patients in the antibiotic group (n = 89) were treated with local wound care and given either dicloxacillin, cephalexin, or erythromycin orally for seven days. Patients in the control group (n = 96) received local wound care only. All patients had their wounds irrigated with a 1% povidone-iodine solution and debrided and sutured if clinically indicated. All patients were subsequently reevaluated for clinical signs of wound infection. The groups were similar in age, sex, time of delay in seeking treatment, anatomic sites of wounds, depths and types of wounds, and number of wounds requiring suturing. The wound infection rates for the antibiotic and control groups were 1.1 and 5.1%, respectively. This difference was not significant (P = 0.212). There were 36 wounds in the antibiotic group and 37 wounds in the control group that were full thickness. The infection rates for these wounds were 2.8 and 13.5%, respectively. This was not statistically significant (P = 0.132). This study suggests that prophylactic oral antibiotics in low-risk dog bite wounds are not indicated.
Document 7 (Title: Treatment of common dog bites: infection risk factors.): In a retrospective study of 106 patients with complete follow-up of dog bites treated in the emergency department the following factors greatly increased the risk of infection: age greater than 50 years, delay in seeking treatment, location on an upper extremity, and puncture wounds. Debridement and irrigation decreased the incidence of infection, and sutured wounds were not more likely to become infected than those left open. Prophylactic antibiotics provided no benefit in this series. In the literature, overall infection rates varied widely according to the various patient populations. Up to 50% of infections from dog bites are caused by pasturella multocida, and the remainder by a wide range of organisms, including streptococcus. Ninety-five percent of these organisms will be sensitive to penicillin.
Document 8 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): In the United States, dogs bite >4.7 million people each year and are responsible for 80% of all animal-bite wounds, an estimated 15–20% of which become infected. Each year, 800,000 Americans seek medical attention for dog bites; of those injured, 386,000 require treatment in an emergency department, with >1000 emergency department visits each day and about a dozen deaths per year. Most dog bites are provoked and are inflicted by the victim’s pet or by a dog known to the victim. These bites are frequently sustained during efforts to break up a dogfight. Children are more likely than adults to sustain canine bites, with the highest incidence of 6 bites/1000 population among boys 5–9 years old. Victims are more often male than female, and bites most often involve an upper extremity. Among children <4 years old, two-thirds of all these injuries involve the head or neck. Infection typically manifests 8–24 h after the bite as pain at the site of injury with cellulitis accompanied by
Document 9 (Title: Three Stories (House)): At the lecture, House presents three cases of patients with leg pain to the students. The three stories are intercut with each other; the following summary presents each case in chronological order. The first patient is a farmer who appears to have been bitten by a snake. Foreman and Chase visit the man's farm and find a timber rattlesnake. However, the farmer suffers an allergic reaction to the anti-venom and a test of the snake’s venom sac indicates that it did not recently bite anyone. The patient continues to decline, and when House informs him he is dying, he asks what will happen to his dog. House then realizes that the farmer was bitten by his dog, and bacteria from its mouth caused necrotizing fasciitis. The dog is euthanized and the farmer’s leg is amputated, but he survives.
Document 10 (Title: Dog bite): The behavior of a dog may not always indicate its friendliness or unlikelihood of biting. This is because when a dog wags its tail, most people interpret this as the dog expressing happiness and friendliness. Though indeed tail wagging can express these positive emotions, tail wagging is also an indication of fear, insecurity, anxiety, challenging of dominance, establishing social relationships or a warning that the dog may bite. Treatment When a person receives a dog bite where the skin is broken, the risk of a serious infection can be reduced by cleaning the wound and getting appropriate health care treatment. It is important to find out if the dog's rabies vaccinations are current. A Cochrane review found that there is not much evidence for or against current practices of keeping dog bite wounds being left open to heal for a short time before closure (delayed closure) or not stitched at all (no closure) over immediate closure by stitching.
Document 11 (Title: Cutaneous nocardiosis associated with insect bites.): We report the first case of cutaneous nocardiosis associated with insect bites. The patient received these insect bites while camping a few days before he presented to the emergency room. The patient was a healthy twenty-six-year-old man, who was asplenic as a result of a motor vehicle accident. He presented to the emergency room with fever, multiple insect bites to his left lower extremity with pustules, lymphangitis, and left inguinal adenopathy. He was hospitalized but his condition failed to improve despite treatment with intravenous nafcillin for three days. Wound and blood cultures subsequently grew Nocardia brasiliensis. Treatment with intravenous amikacin (5 mg/kg every eight hours) was instituted along with oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole double strength twice a day. The patient recovered with minimal scarring of the extremity. The amikacin was stopped after seven days and the patient was discharged to receive oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. This disease should be kept in mind when cutaneous infections do not respond to standard antibiotics, especially in the southwestern United States.
Document 12 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): including Peptococ-cus species, Peptostreptococcus species, Bacteroides species, and Eikenella corrodens (facultative anaerobe). Human bites are characterized by a higher bacterial load (>105). Antibiotic prophylaxis after a human bite is recommended as it has been shown to significantly decrease the rate of infection.61 A course of 3 to 7 days of amoxicillin/clavulanate is typically used. Alter-natives are doxycycline or clindamycin with ciprofloxacin.There is controversy over the closure of bite wounds. Typically, in areas of aesthetic importance, the wound is thor-oughly irrigated and debrided and primarily closed with a short course of antibiotics and close follow-up to monitor for signs of infection. In areas that are less cosmetically sensitive and bites that look grossly contaminated or infected, the wounds 5Brunicardi_Ch16_p0511-p0540.indd 51919/02/19 3:08 PM 520SPECIFIC CONSIDERATIONSPART IIABCFigure 16-3.

Document 13 (Title: Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Facial Laceration Repair -- Preparation): Additionally, the need for any infection prophylaxis should be determined before beginning the repair. For example, bite wounds require prophylactic antibiotics and may require rabies vaccination. Amoxicillin-clavulanate is recommended for dog, cat, and human bites; other agents may be administered if patients are allergic to penicillins. In addition, tetanus toxoid injections, such as Td or TDaP, or human tetanus immunoglobulin may be required.
Document 14 (Title: Patient (grammar)): The grammatical patient is often confused with the direct object. However, there is a significant difference. The patient is a semantic property, defined in terms of the meaning of a phrase; but the direct object is a syntactic property, defined in terms of the phrase's role in the structure of a sentence. For example, in the sentence "The dog bites the man", "the man" is both the patient and the direct object. By contrast, in the sentence "The man is bitten by the dog", which has the same meaning but different grammatical structure, "the man" is still the patient, but now stands as the phrase's subject; and "the dog" is only the agent.

Document 15 (Title: [Pasteurella multocida infections: bites by dogs or cats?].): Annually 50,000 to 100,000 animal bites are seen by physicians in the Netherlands. Infections of these bite wounds frequently occur. Pasteurella multocida is one of the main causes of these infections and many serious complications may occur. We present 3 patients with disturbances in wound healing after animal bites or scratches due to infection with P. multocida. In view of the high infection ratio after cat bites we advise giving amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (Augmentin) for 5 days as prophylaxis. According to the literature prophylaxis for dog bites is not necessary. However, fatal complications after dog bites due to infections with Capnocytophaga canimorsus (DF-2) support those who prefer to give antibiotics after these bites also.
