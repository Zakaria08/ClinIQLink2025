Document 1 (Title: Leukemoid reaction): Diagnosis Conventionally, a leukocytosis exceeding 50,000 WBC/mm3 with a significant increase in early neutrophil precursors is referred to as a leukemoid reaction. The peripheral blood smear may show myelocytes, metamyelocytes, promyelocytes, and rarely myeloblasts; however, there is a mixture of early mature neutrophil precursors, in contrast to the immature forms typically seen in acute leukemia. Serum leukocyte alkaline phosphatase is normal or elevated in leukemoid reaction, but is depressed in chronic myelogenous leukemia. The bone marrow in a leukemoid reaction, if examined, may be hypercellular but is otherwise typically unremarkable.
Document 2 (Title: Pancytopenia -- Evaluation): The initial workup includes a complete blood count, along with a reticulocyte count. This will help to determine if the pancytopenia is secondary to decreased production. The mean corpuscular volume would point towards megaloblastic anemia. A peripheral blood smear can show abnormal cells such as blasts, dysplastic leukocytes, and immature cells. These abnormal cells may be related to conditions described in table 3. The diagnosis related to abnormal cells may require further investigations: Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy Cytogenetic testing (fluorescent in situ hybridization [FISH] or karyotype) of bone marrow or peripheral blood Flow cytometry of bone marrow and/or peripheral blood Molecular studies (e.g., mutation analysis, gene expression profiling) The workup should also include vitamin B12 and folate levels, liver chemistry, and lactate dehydrogenase.
Document 3 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Hematologic and Marrow Findings In untreated CML, leukocytosis ranging from 10–500 × 109/L is common. The peripheral blood differential shows left-shifted hematopoiesis with predominance of neutrophils and the presence of bands, myelocytes, metamyelocytes, promyelocytes, and blasts (usually ≤5%). Basophils and/or eosinophils are frequently increased. Thrombocytosis is common, but thrombocytopenia is rare and, when present, suggests a worse prognosis, disease acceleration, or an unrelated etiology. Anemia is present in one-third of patients. Cyclic oscillations of counts are noted in 25% of patients without treatment. Biochemical abnormalities include a low leukocyte alkaline phosphatase score and high levels of vitamin B12, uric acid, lactic dehydrogenase, and lysozyme. The presence of unexplained and sustained leukocytosis, with or without splenomegaly, should lead to a marrow examination and cytogenetic analysis.
Document 4 (Title: [i(17q) appearing in acute phase in Ph1-negative, BCR-negative CML].): A 36-year-old woman was referred to our hospital because of splenomegaly in February 1989. The leukocyte count was 55,500/microliter without hiatus leukemicus. The leukocyte alkaline phosphatase score was low (29). The bone marrow showed myeloid hyperplasia (24.8% myeloblasts) but no dysplastic change. The karyotype of the bone marrow cells was 46, XX and a diagnosis of Ph1 (-) CML was made. Treatment with VCR, 6MP and prednisolone made 7-month duration chronic phase, but the abnormal karyotype.[46, XX, i(17q)] gradually increased to 100% of bone marrow cells. The patient died in June 1990. The evidence that not only a BCR rearrangement but also messages of BCR/ABL fusion gene were negative made us able to differentiate this case from Ph1(-), BCR(+) CML. The addition of an i(17q) results in partial monosomy of 17q (17q13;p53 gene) and partial trisomy of 17q (17q11.2-12;G-CSF gene). We examined the rearrangement of p53 gene and G-CSF-dependent tumor cell growth in vitro, demonstrating one allelic loss of p53 gene and independent cell growth on G-CSF respectively. It is thought that in Ph1 (-), BCR (-) CML as well as in Ph1 (+) CML, an i(17q) is related to the progression but not to the initiation of these leukemias. However the precise mechanism, including p53 gene inactivation by point mutation, is still to be elucidated.
Document 5 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): No signs or symptoms are specific for PMF. Many patients are asymptomatic at presentation, and the disease is usually detected by the discovery of splenic enlargement and/or abnormal blood counts during a routine examination. However, in contrast to its companion MPN, night sweats, fatigue, and weight loss are common presenting complaints. A blood smear will show the characteristic features of extramedullary hematopoiesis: teardrop-shaped red cells, nucleated red cells, myelocytes, and promyelocytes; myeloblasts may also be present (Fig. 131-1). Anemia, usually mild initially, is the rule, whereas the leukocyte and platelet counts are either normal or increased, but either can be depressed. Mild hepatomegaly may accompany the splenomegaly but is unusual in the absence of splenic enlargement; isolated lymphadenopathy should suggest another diagnosis. Both serum lactate dehydrogenase and alkaline phosphatase levels can be elevated. The LAP score can be low, normal, or high. Marrow is
Document 6 (Title: [One-year remission of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) after discontinuation of interferon-alpha].): A 53-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital on Nov. 16, 1987, because of general fatigue. On admission, she had hepatosplenomegaly and her peripheral blood profile showed a white blood cell count (WBC) of 309 x 10(3)/microliters with immature neutrophils, a hemoglobin level (Hb) of 7.6 g/dl, platelet count (PLT) of 536 x 10(3)/microliters, neutrophilic alkaline phosphatase (NAP) score of 44. Both Vitamin B12 and LDH levels were high. The bone marrow showed marked myeloid hyperplasia. In a cytogenetic study, Ph1 was found in 3 of 8 metaphases and Ph1 with an additional abnormality of 8 trisomy was noted in 5 of 8 metaphases. She was diagnosed as having chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and treated by i.m. injection of interferon (IFN)-alpha at a daily dose of 6 x 10(6) U. Administration of IFN-alpha induced fever for a few days. WBC, PLT count and LDH level gradually decreased, and the NAP score and hepatosplenomegaly improved. She achieved remission in February, 1988. Administration of IFN-alpha was stopped in April, 1988, when the bone marrow showed hypocellularity and normal karyotype. She was treated with 20 mg of prednisolone daily from May until August, because of progressive pancytopenia. She had received no treatment until July, 1989. In May, 1989, the bone marrow again showed myeloid hyperplasia and Ph1 was found in all cells analyzed. Therefore, we resumed IFN-alpha treatment. It is interesting that remission of CML continues for more than one year after discontinuation of IFN-alpha in this case.
Document 7 (Title: [Hairy cell leukemia of European-American type with dual T and B-cell phenotype].): A 46-year-old woman was admitted because of palpitation and conjunctival jaundice. Physical examination revealed hepatosplenomegaly and purpura without lymphadenopathy. Blood count showed 4.7 g/dl hemoglobin with increased reticulocytosis. The platelet count was 1.5 X 10(4)/microliters and the leukocyte count was 6,000/microliters with 17% abnormal mononuclear cells (hairy cells). Hairy cells had nuclei of frequently folded shape and abundant cytoplasma with irregular edges on blood films. The hair-like cytoplasmic projections of the cells were clearly seen under the phase-contrast microscopy. Hairy cells were strongly positive for tartrate resistant acid phosphatase. Bone marrow aspiration was unsuccessful. The biopsy specimens showed small patchy and scattering infiltrations by hairy cells. Surface marker studies of hairy cells revealed that they were strongly positive for SmIg (IgG kappa). They also reacted with alpha B 1, alpha Tac, alpha Leu-M 5 monoclonal antibodies and a rabbit anti-hairy cell serum (alpha HC-M). 53% of hairy cells were shown to react with alpha B 1 and alpha OKT 11 simultaneously by double labelling. The southern blot analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells showed IgH chain genes rearrangement and germ line patterns of T-cell receptor genes. Hemolysis was promptly disappeared after blood transfusion. Moreover, the red blood cells, platelets and leukocytes have spontaneously returned to normal levels with disappearance of circulating hairy cells and palpable spleen one year after admission.
Document 8 (Title: Myeloproliferative Neoplasms -- Pathophysiology): MPL proto-oncogene mutation :  The MPL gene codes the thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor which regulates megakaryopoiesis through a JAK-STAT pathway. The most common somatic MPL mutations are MPL W515L and MPL W515K which cause spontaneous activation of the JAK-STAT pathway, resulting in abnormal hematopoietic cell proliferation. [8] These mutations are found in up to 6% of ET and up to 10% of PMF as per literature. [4] [9] Furthermore, this mutation will help categorize patients diagnosed with negative JAK2 V617F mutation and Philadelphia chromosome MPN. MPL mutations increase the risk of thrombotic complications as compared to JAK2 V617F mutation patients and are associated with low hemoglobin, low bone marrow (BM) cellularity, high platelets, and high serum erythropoietin levels. [9] [10]
Document 9 (Title: TLR9): Function The TLR family plays a fundamental role in pathogen recognition and activation of innate immunity. TLRs are named for the high degree of conservation in structure and function seen between mammalian TLRs and the Drosophila transmembrane protein Toll. TLRs are transmembrane proteins, expressed on the cell surface and the endocytic compartment and recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) that are expressed on infectious agents and initiate signaling to induce production of cytokines necessary for the innate immunity and subsequent adaptive immunity. The various TLRs exhibit different patterns of expression. This gene is preferentially expressed in immune cell rich tissues, such as spleen, lymph node, bone marrow and peripheral blood leukocytes. Studies in mice and humans indicate that this receptor mediates cellular response to unmethylated CpG dinucleotides in bacterial DNA to mount an innate immune response.
Document 10 (Title: Common Variable Immunodeficiency -- Pathophysiology): B Cells abnormalities: The number of B cells is normal in the majority of patients, but many of them have reduced percentages of isotype-switched memory B cells capable of producing immunoglobin isotypes that are critical toward antibody response recall. The abnormalities that appear to occur in the bone marrow include aberrant gene rearrangement, decreased V gene replacements, reduced diversity of the naïve B cell repertoire, impaired somatic hypermutation, and abnormal expansion of unmutated B cell clones. [13] Toll-like receptor signaling: B cell maturation is defective, and the action of toll-like receptors 7 and 9 (TLR7 and TLR9) becomes impaired because of a yet unknown mechanism. Defective signaling of TLR7 and TLR9 in B cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells, along with deficient IFN-a, impairs B cell functions and prevents TLR-mediated augmentation of humoral immunity in vivo. [14] [15] The binding of viral RNA to TLR7 or bacterial DNA to TLR9 leads to B cell activation, cytokine secretion, proliferation, and survival; in CVID, the loss of these stimuli functions may contribute to the B cell defects mentioned. [16] [17] Memory B cells: determining the number of isotype-switched memory B cells is of utmost interest because it provides information about the immaturity of the B cell, relates to the numbers of plasma cells in the bone marrow, and gives information about the possible clinical outcomes. [18] Various studies tried to classify CVID patients based on numbers of isotype-switched memory B cells [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] : Patients that switched CD27+IgM-IgD- memory B cells had a higher prevalence of splenomegaly and autoimmune cytopenias. This proposed a fast and reliable new classification for CVID patients with flow cytometric quantification of class-switched memory and immature B cells. Certain disorders were more prevalent in patients with the lowest count of memory B cells (splenomegaly, lymphoid proliferation, granulomatous disease). Lower levels of IgM memory B cells were associated with chronic pulmonary disease (bronchiectasis). Research has determined that the percentages of switched memory B cells changed in some patients over time. Based on these findings, the suggestion is that immunologic characteristics have to be evaluated several times after diagnosis. [24] Decreased T lymphocyte proliferation to mitogens and antigens, [1] reduced T regulatory cells, [25] T cell receptor excision circles that suggest thymic dysregulation, [26] defective T cell receptor signal transduction. Decrease in CD4+ cell count or increase in CD8+ cell count, altering the CD4/CD8 ratio. [27] Increase in CD26 and CD30 levels (the last ones associated with splenomegaly and malignancy) [28] .

Document 11 (Title: First_Aid_Step2): Chronic: Without treatment, typically lasts 3.5–5.0 years. Signs and symptoms are as described above. Infection and bleeding complications are rare. Accelerated: A transition toward blast crisis, with an ↑ in peripheral and bone marrow blood counts. Should be suspected when the differential shows an abrupt ↑ in basophils and thrombocytopenia < 100,000. Blast: Resembles acute leukemia; survival is 3–6 months. ■Diagnosed by the clinical picture, including labs; cytogenetic analysis usually reveals the Philadelphia chromosome. TAB LE 2.7 -7. Clinical Staging of CLL (Rai Staging) CBwC shows a very high WBC—often > 100,000 at diagnosis, and sometimes reaching > 500,000. Differential shows granulocytes in all stages of maturation. Rarely, the WBC count will be so elevated as to cause a hyperviscosity syndrome. Leukocyte alkaline phosphatase is low; LDH, uric acid, and B12 levels are elevated.
Document 12 (Title: Myelophthisic Anemia -- Evaluation): The combinations of relevant laboratory data, peripheral blood smear, and bone marrow biopsy should be studied to recognize and appropriately diagnose myelophthisic anemia. Laboratory data include a complete blood count, which shows the level of white blood cells, hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelets, MCV, reticulocyte counts, and red cell distribution width. In myelophthisic anemia, pancytopenia could be found due to infiltration by cancers and also fibrosis. MCV is usually normal in this type of cancer, and reticulocyte counts are low. A peripheral blood smear shows abnormal red blood cells ranging from immature to defective shapes and the size of the cells. Red blood cells be nucleated, and some be in teardrop forms. Other cells include giant platelets and immature leucocytes. The presence of these immature cells is called leucoerythroblastic. [7] Bone marrow biopsy shows signs of infiltration by primary cancer and fibrosis in cases secondary to granulomatous infections or autoimmune diseases. [4]
Document 13 (Title: RANKL): The level of RANKL expression does not linearly correlate to the effect of this ligand. High protein expression of RANKL is commonly detected in the lungs, thymus and lymph nodes. Low protein expression is found in bone marrow, the stomach, peripheral blood, the spleen, the placenta, leukocytes, the heart, the thyroid, and skeletal muscle. While bone marrow expresses low levels of RANKL, RANKL plays a critical role for adequate bone metabolism. This surface-bound molecule (also known as CD254), found on osteoblasts, serves to activate osteoclasts, which are critically involved in bone resorption. Osteoclastic activity is triggered via the osteoblasts' surface-bound RANKL activating the osteoclasts' surface-bound receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B (RANK). Recent studies suggest that in postnatal bones, the osteocyte is the major source of RANKL regulating bone remodeling. RANKL derived from other cell types contributes to bone loss in conditions involving inflammation such
Document 14 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): FIGURE 134-5 Acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The cells are hetero-geneous in size and have round or convoluted nuclei, high nuclear/ cytoplasmic ratio, and absence of cytoplasmic granules. present with signs of bone marrow failure such as pallor, fatigue, bleeding, fever, and infection related to peripheral blood cytopenias. Peripheral blood counts regularly show anemia and thrombocytopenia but might show leukopenia, a normal leukocyte count, or leukocytosis based largely on the number of circulating malignant cells (Fig. 134-5). Extramedullary sites of disease are frequently involved in patients who present with leukemia, including lymphadenopathy, hepatoor splenomegaly, CNS disease, testicular enlargement, and/or cutaneous infiltration.
Document 15 (Title: Leukemoid reaction): Leukemoid reactions are generally benign and are not dangerous in and of themselves, although they are often a response to a significant disease state (see Causes above). However, leukemoid reactions can resemble more serious conditions such as chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), which can present with identical findings on the peripheral blood smear. Historically, various clues including the leukocyte alkaline phosphatase score and the presence of basophilia were used to distinguish CML from a leukemoid reaction. However, at present the test of choice in adults to distinguish CML is an assay for the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome, either via cytogenetics and FISH, or via PCR for the BCR/ABL fusion gene. The LAP (Leukocyte Alkaline Phosphatase) score is high in reactive states but is low in CML. In cases where the diagnosis is uncertain, a qualified hematologist or oncologist should be consulted.
