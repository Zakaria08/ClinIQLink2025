Document 1 (Title: [2 cases of intermittent hydronephrosis--usefulness of ultrasonography].): Case 1: An 8-year-old boy consulted our clinic complaining of left flank colicky pain. He had a past history of the same episode. Ultrasonographic study was promptly performed. Left hydronephrosis was detected. At operation, left aberrant renal vessel was resected, and he has been free of pain. Case 2: A 65-year-old woman consulted our clinic because of abdominal pain and fever, who occasionally had the same episode. The existence and disappearance of the right hydronephrosis could be observed by emergency ultrasonography and following ultrasonic study, and the stenosis of the right lower ureter caused of cystitis cystica and glandularis was pointed out by retrograde ureterography. Diuresis ultrasonography by furosemide was performed to evaluate urinary tract stricture. In case 1, an incomplete obstruction pattern was obtained after operation, and in case 2, a complete obstruction pattern was shown. The emergency ultrasonography and diuresis ultrasonography were useful for the diagnosis and observation of intermittent hydronephrosis.
Document 2 (Title: Ureter): Clinical significance Ureteral stones A kidney stone can move from the kidney and become lodged inside the ureter, which can block the flow of urine, as well as cause a sharp cramp in the back, side, or lower abdomen. Pain often comes in waves lasting up to two hours, then subsides, called renal colic. The affected kidney could then develop hydronephrosis, should a part of the kidney become swollen due to blocked flow of urine. It is classically described that there are three sites in the ureter where a kidney stone will commonly become stuck: where the ureter meets the renal pelvis; where the iliac blood vessels cross the ureters; and where the ureters enter the urinary bladder, however a retrospective case study, which is a primary source, of where stones lodged based on medical imaging did not show many stones at the place where the iliac blood vessels cross.
Document 3 (Title: Case Study: 24-Year-Old Male Presenting With Polyarthralgias (Archived) -- Confirmatory Evaluation): During a follow-up appointment a few weeks later, he complained of multiple subcutaneous nodules. On physical exam, multiple, tender, non-erythematous subcutaneous nodules were noted along with a palpable, non-tender mass on the left side of the abdomen. CT abdomen showed a large heterogeneous mass measuring 20.1 by 10.7 by 18.1 cm, in the left quadrant of the abdomen along with a poorly defined low attenuation mass measuring 2.9 by 3 cm in the right hepatic lobe. CT guided biopsy of the left-sided abdominal mass was non-diagnostic. He underwent exploratory laparotomy, with excision of the left-sided abdominal mass along with splenectomy and distal pancreatectomy. There were multiple abnormal areas in the liver concerning for metastases. Pathology of the resected mass revealed sheets of malignant acinar cells with no intervening ductal structures or islets. Tumor cells were positive for trypsin and cytokeratin and were negative for CD117 and synaptophysin, consistent with pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma. Serum CA 19-9 levels were high. Lipase levels were elevated at 40,000U/dL. At this point, based on the biopsy and staging, the patient was diagnosed with stage IV pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma, but the cause of his polyarthralgia was still uncertain. Adjuvant chemotherapy was initiated with leucovorin, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and oxaliplatin for the carcinoma. During his treatment, his joint swelling and pain progressed and involved new joints of right ankle and left knee. Imaging studies of the joints showed joint effusion and soft tissue swelling. Arthrocentesis of the right ankle joint was performed, and the synovial fluid studies were consistent with infection and cultures were positive for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Pseudomonas. He was treated with antibiotics including vancomycin and piperacillin–tazobactam without any improvement. Due to progressive worsening of the right ankle joint, he required irrigation and debridement with arthrotomy. Repeat cultures were negative, but his symptoms continued to worsen, and he had persistent drainage of milky colored fluid from the surgical site and eventually required a below-knee amputation. Surgical pathology of the right knee joint revealed acute on chronic inflammation with the presence of granulation and fibrin tissue, without any evidence of malignancy. For further evaluation, arthrocentesis of left knee, left ankle, and right wrist was done and yielded milky colored fluid. His lipase levels continued to remain above 20,000 U/dL despite being treated with chemotherapy.
Document 4 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): A 45-year-old man is brought to the local hospital emer-gency department by ambulance. His wife reports that he had been in his normal state of health until 3 days ago when he developed a fever and a productive cough. Dur-ing the last 24 hours he has complained of a headache and is increasingly confused. His wife reports that his medical history is significant only for hypertension, for which he takes hydrochlorothiazide and lisinopril, and that he is allergic to amoxicillin. She says that he developed a rash many years ago when prescribed amoxicillin for bron-chitis. In the emergency department, the man is febrile (38.7°C [101.7°F]), hypotensive (90/54 mmHg), tachypneic (36/min), and tachycardic (110/min). He has no signs of meningismus but is oriented only to person. A stat chest x-ray shows a left lower lung consolidation consistent with pneumonia. A CT scan is not concerning for lesions or elevated intracranial pressure. The plan is to start empiric antibiotics and perform a
Document 5 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): Camille E. Beauduy, PharmD, & Lisa G. Winston, MD* A 60-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a 2-month history of fatigue, weight loss (10 kg), fevers, night sweats, and a productive cough. He is currently living with friends and has been intermittently homeless, spending time in shelters. He reports drinking about 6 beers per day. In the emergency department, a chest x-ray shows a right apical infiltrate. Given the high suspicion for pulmonary tuberculosis, the patient is placed in respiratory isolation. His first sputum smear shows many acid-fast bacilli, and an HIV test returns with a positive result. What drugs should be started for treatment of presumptive pulmonary tubercu-losis? Does the patient have a heightened risk of developing medication toxicity? If so, which medication(s) would be likely to cause toxicity?
Document 6 (Title: Case Study: 24-Year-Old Male Presenting With Polyarthralgias (Archived) -- Case Presentation): A 24-year-old white male with no known medical history presented to the hospital with chief complaints of 2 weeks of progressively worsening pain and swelling of his right wrist and left ankle joints. He did not report any fevers, chills, night sweats, weight loss or rash. He was employed as a fireman. He denied alcohol use disorder, smoking cigarettes, or any recreational drugs. Family history was significant for hypertension in father and ovarian cancer in the mother. His vital signs were within normal limits on presentation. On physical examination, the patient had significant swelling of multiple joints including the right wrist, right elbow, and left ankle. The joints were erythematous and tender to touch. Due to severe pain, he had limited range in the involved joints.
Document 7 (Title: [Embolism caused by a bullet. Report of a case and review of the literature].): We describe the case of a 23 years old male, who suffered a 45 bullet wound in the arm and upper right hemithorax. He walked after his injury and 10 minutes later presented dizziness, cough and tachycardia. On admission a minor haemothorax was seen on a chest X ray, but the bullet was not seen. Even without symptoms, an X ray of abdomen showed the missile lying above the left sacroiliac joint. A chest tube was placed, the patient had an excellent recovery and was discharged a week later. After several months he presented hemoptysis and a moderate pain on his right chest and was treated as an acute bronchitis. Six months after his initial injury he developed a florid picture of acute pulmonary embolism (chest pain, dyspnea, hemoptysis, tachycardia, severe cough). A new chest X ray was done and the bullet was shown lying in the right chest. A pulmonary arteriography located it in a lower basal branch. Through a posterolateral thoracotomy the slug was obtained. The recovery was uneventful and he has remained well since. We discuss the possible mechanisms to explain the entrance of the bullet into the vascular system and conclude that in cases of gunshot wounds: a) An exit wound must be always searched for; if not found exploratory X ray are mandatory, b) If the bullet is not found, specially after thoracic injuries, bullet embolism should be contemplated, c) If there are signs of regional ischemia arteriography is mandatory.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Document 8 (Title: Kidney stone disease): Signs and symptoms The hallmark of a stone that obstructs the ureter or renal pelvis is excruciating, intermittent pain that radiates from the flank to the groin or to the inner thigh. This is due to the transfer of referred pain signals from the lower thoracic splanchnic nerves to the lumbar splanchnic nerves as the stone passes down from the kidney or proximal ureter to the distal ureter. This pain, known as renal colic, is often described as one of the strongest pain sensations known. Renal colic caused by kidney stones is commonly accompanied by urinary urgency, restlessness, hematuria, sweating, nausea, and vomiting. It typically comes in waves lasting 20 to 60 minutes caused by peristaltic contractions of the ureter as it attempts to expel the stone.
Document 9 (Title: Kidney stone disease): Diagnosis Diagnosis of kidney stones is made on the basis of information obtained from the history, physical examination, urinalysis, and radiographic studies. Clinical diagnosis is usually made on the basis of the location and severity of the pain, which is typically colicky in nature (comes and goes in spasmodic waves). Pain in the back occurs when calculi produce an obstruction in the kidney. Physical examination may reveal fever and tenderness at the costovertebral angle on the affected side. Imaging studies Calcium-containing stones are relatively radiodense, and they can often be detected by a traditional radiograph of the abdomen that includes the kidneys, ureters, and bladder (KUB film). Some 60% of all renal stones are radiopaque. In general, calcium phosphate stones have the greatest density, followed by calcium oxalate and magnesium ammonium phosphate stones. Cystine calculi are only faintly radiodense, while uric acid stones are usually entirely radiolucent.
Document 10 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): Helge Eilers, MD, & Spencer Yost, MD An elderly man with type 2 diabetes mellitus and ischemic pain in the lower extremity is scheduled for femoral-to-popliteal artery bypass surgery. He has a history of hyper-tension and coronary artery disease with symptoms of stable angina. He can walk only half a block before pain in his legs forces him to stop. He has a 50-pack-year smoking history but stopped 2 years ago. Medications include atenolol, atorvastatin, and hydrochlorothiazide. The nurse in the preoperative holding area obtains the following vital signs: temperature 36.8°C (98.2°F), blood pressure 168/100 mm Hg, heart rate 78 bpm, oxygen saturation by pulse oximeter 96% while breathing room air, and pain 5/10 in the right lower leg after walking into the hospital. What anesthetic agents will you choose for his anesthetic plan? Why? Does the choice of anesthetic make a difference?
Document 11 (Title: Five Rights of Nursing Delegation -- Issues of Concern -- Five Rights of Delegation Case Study Approach): Mark is a new graduate registered nurse who has recently completed nursing orientation. He is now on his second week of non-precepted practice on a busy medical-surgical unit. During the middle of his busy night shift, Mark has several tasks that need to be completed quickly. These tasks include a linen change for a patient who just vomited, an assessment of a possibly infiltrated intravenous line, and the administration of intravenous pain medication for a patient who rates her pain 10 out of 10. Mark also needs to make hourly rounds within the next few minutes, and he is very behind on his charting. He knows he must delegate some of the tasks to his coworkers. However, Mark is unsure what he can delegate and to whom. He decides to use the five rights of delegation to help with his delegation decisions. Right tasks
Document 12 (Title: Anatomy_Gray): The patient unfortunately died on the operating table. In this patient’s case, a “tongue” of tumor grew into the inferior vena cava. At the time of surgery, the initial dissection mobilized the kidney on its vascular pedicle; however, a large portion of tumor became detached in the inferior vena cava. The tumor embolus passed through the right atrium and right ventricle and occluded the pulmonary artery. This could not be cleared at the time of surgery, and the patient succumbed. A 65-year-old businessman came to the emergency department with severe lower abdominal pain that was predominantly central and left sided. He had pain radiating into the left loin, and he also noticed he was passing gas and fecal debris as he urinated. A CT scan of his abdomen and pelvis was performed (eFig. 4.191).
Document 13 (Title: 38-Year-Old Male Presents With Lower Extremity Edema -- Case Presentation): His physical exam revealed clear lungs and a normal heart exam on auscultation. His abdomen was soft and non-tender, and his skin was warm and dry with no rash. He had 2 plus pitting edema at the ankles. Initial laboratory data was consistent with acute kidney injury (AKI) with worsening creatinine from 1.2 to 1.6 over 1 month and nephrotic range proteinuria. Serologies for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, anti-nuclear antibody (ANA), c-ANCA, serine protease 3 (PR3) IgG, myeloperoxidase antibody (MPO), and complement levels were sent. He was started on losartan for proteinuria with plans for renal biopsy; however, he was lost to follow up. The patient then presented two weeks later with worsening edema to his waist, continued weight gain, mild hemoptysis, and streaks of blood in the stool. Physical examination now showed worsening pitting edema up to his waist with new non-pruritic, erythematous excoriations on the medial aspect of his thighs bilaterally. He was admitted to the hospital with concern for worsening vasculitis. He was started on oral prednisone and underwent a renal biopsy. For his edema, he was started on diuretics to which he responded well. Due to persistent leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing was performed to complete the workup.
Document 14 (Title: [Peripheral blood involvement accompanied with hypercalcemia in the malignant lymphoma of iliac bone].): We reported a rare case of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of iliac bone which developed peripheral blood involvement associated with hypercalcemia. 42-year-old man was admitted to Fukui Medical School Hospital because of right iliac bone pain. An X-ray film of the pelvis disclosed the osteolytic change of right iliac bone. A CT scan of the pelvis showed soft tissue density tumors involved bilateral iliac bone. He had no superficial lymphadenopathy or organomegaly. Examination of peripheral blood and bone marrow did not show any abnormalities. Monoclonal immunoglobulin was not detected in serum. Examination of biopsied specimens from iliac bone tumor showed infiltration of round cells. Immunocytochemical analysis showed only MT-1 positive. He was treated with combination chemotherapy of vindesine, cyclophosphamide, prednisolone and pirarubicin followed by radiation therapy. But, there was no significant response. Following radiation therapy, he developed coma. Serum calcium was 9.8 mEq/l. The pathologic immature cells were found in peripheral blood. The bone marrow aspirates showed 63% pathologic cells. These cells expressed CD19, CD20, HLA-DR antigens. He was diagnosed as having leukemic non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, B-cell type, and was treated with combination chemotherapy. But he died of systemic fungal infection.
Document 15 (Title: Pyelonephritis): Signs and symptoms Signs and symptoms of acute pyelonephritis generally develop rapidly over a few hours or a day. It can cause high fever, pain on passing urine, and abdominal pain that radiates along the flank towards the back. There is often associated vomiting. Chronic pyelonephritis causes persistent flank or abdominal pain, signs of infection (fever, unintentional weight loss, malaise, decreased appetite), lower urinary tract symptoms and blood in the urine. Chronic pyelonephritis can in addition cause fever of unknown origin. Furthermore, inflammation-related proteins can accumulate in organs and cause the condition AA amyloidosis. Physical examination may reveal fever and tenderness at the costovertebral angle on the affected side.

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
Question: A 53-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of severe right-sided flank pain for 3 hours. The pain is colicky, radiates towards his right groin, and he describes it as 8/10 in intensity. He has vomited once. He has no history of similar episodes in the past. Last year, he was treated with naproxen for swelling and pain of his right toe. He has a history of hypertension. He drinks one to two beers on the weekends. Current medications include amlodipine. He appears uncomfortable. His temperature is 37.1°C (99.3°F), pulse is 101/min, and blood pressure is 130/90 mm Hg. Examination shows a soft, nontender abdomen and right costovertebral angle tenderness. An upright x-ray of the abdomen shows no abnormalities.
