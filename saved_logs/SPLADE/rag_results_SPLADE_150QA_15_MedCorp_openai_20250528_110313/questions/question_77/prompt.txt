Document 1 (Title: Otosclerosis -- Evaluation -- High-Resolution Computed Tomography): Noncontrast, high-resolution computed tomography (CT) of the temporal bones is the gold standard for diagnosing otosclerosis (see Image. Otosclerosis). [58] In more overt cases, foci of spongiotic or sclerotic bone can be identified in the area anterior to the oval window. Additionally, the extent of thickening of the stapes footplate and round window involvement will inform the preoperative planning process. In cases of cochlear otosclerosis, a "halo sign" may be seen, in which radiolucent foci extend from the fissula ante fenestram around the cochlea itself. [59] A grading system suggested by Symons and Fanning can be used to characterize the severity of otosclerosis based on CT findings: [60]
Document 2 (Title: Ototoxicity): Ototoxicity is the property of being toxic to the ear (oto-), specifically the cochlea or auditory nerve and sometimes the vestibular system, for example, as a side effect of a drug. The effects of ototoxicity can be reversible and temporary, or irreversible and permanent. It has been recognized since the 19th century. There are many well-known ototoxic drugs used in clinical situations, and they are prescribed, despite the risk of hearing disorders, for very serious health conditions. Ototoxic drugs include antibiotics (such as gentamicin, streptomycin, tobramycin), loop diuretics (such as furosemide), and platinum-based chemotherapy agents (such as cisplatin and carboplatin). A number of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) have also been shown to be ototoxic. This can result in sensorineural hearing loss, dysequilibrium, or both. Some environmental and occupational chemicals have also been shown to affect the auditory system and interact with noise.
Document 3 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Halofantrine exhibits erratic bioavailability, but its absorption is significantly enhanced when it is taken with a fatty meal. The elimination half-life of halofantrine is 1–2 days; it is excreted mainly in feces. Halofantrine is metabolized into N-debutyl-halofantrine by the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP3A4. Grapefruit juice should be avoided during treatment because it increases both halofantrine’s bioavailability and halofantrine-induced QT interval prolongation by inhibiting CYP3A4 at the enterocyte level.
Document 4 (Title: [Study of the ototoxicity of amikacin and netilmicin using provoked acoustic oto-emissions and high-frequency audiometry].): To compare the ototoxicity of amikacin and netilmicin, tone audiometry, high-frequency audiometry, early auditory evoked potentials, and evoked otoacoustic emission testing were used to evaluate 30 patients (15 under amikacin and 15 under netilmicin). Ototoxicity was not significantly different in the two groups.
Document 5 (Title: Comparative clinical studies of ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity of amikacin and gentamicin.): A comparative study of the oto- and nephrotoxicity of amikacin and gentamicin was carried out prospectively. Twenty-six gentamicin-treated patients and 27 amikacin-treated patients were monitored for changes in auditory and renal function during and after therapy. Thirteen of those treated with gentamicin and 20 of those treated with amikacin underwent vestibular caloric testing which could be evaluated for evidence of toxicity. In four (15.4%) of the gentamicin-treated patients, nephrotoxicity developed; no such toxicity was seen in the amikacin-treated patients. This difference may have been due to a fortuitously higher incidence of pretreatment renal impairment in the gentamicin-treated group. In two gentamicin-treated patients (7.7%), ototoxicity developed (one auditory, one vestibular), and in two amikacin-treated patients (7.4%), auditory toxicity developed. Statistical analysis of oto- and nephrotoxicity and their risk factors was not attempted because of the small numbers of patients who could be evaluated. Additional patients are being studied.
Document 6 (Title: Neurology_Adams): The common and serious ototoxic effects of the aminoglycoside antibiotics have already been mentioned—both on the cochlear hair cells, with loss of hearing and independently, on the vestibular labyrinths. Prolonged exposure to these agents produces a bilateral vestibulopathy without vertigo. Instead, there tends to be a disequilibrium associated with oscillopsia. The symptoms are especially troublesome when the patient moves. Often the disequilibrium is not discovered until a bedbound patient tries to walk.
Document 7 (Title: Persib Bandung): Halo, Halo Bandung is a song of struggle in the city of Bandung, the fans always sing it at every home or away game to build the fighting spirit of the match. After the match, a Viking Clap will usually be held by players and fans when their team wins the match. Notable fans include Oto Iskandar di Nata (Indonesian politician), Ridwan Kamil (Governor of West Java), Try Sutrisno (6th Vice President of the Republic of Indonesia), Kamidia Radisti (Miss Indonesia 2007), Arina Ephipania (lead vocalist of Mocca), Melody Nurramdhani Laksani (former JKT48 member), Bastian Steel (former Coboy Junior member), Nazril Irham (lead vocalist from Noah), Conchita Caroline (Sportcaster), Ananda Omesh (Indonesian presenter), Kim Kurniawan (former Persib player), and Sergio van Dijk (former Persib player).
Document 8 (Title: Antimalarial medication): Halofantrine is a relatively new drug developed by the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in the 1960s. It is a phenanthrene methanol, chemically related to Quinine and acts acting as a blood schizonticide effective against all Plasmodium parasites. Its mechanism of action is similar to other anti-malarials. Cytotoxic complexes are formed with ferritoporphyrin XI that cause plasmodial membrane damage. Despite being effective against drug resistant parasites, halofantrine is not commonly used in the treatment (prophylactic or therapeutic) of malaria due to its high cost. It has very variable bioavailability and has been shown to have potentially high levels of cardiotoxicity. It is still a useful drug and can be used in patients that are known to be free of heart disease and are suffering from severe and resistant forms of acute malaria. A popular drug based on halofantrine is Halfan. The level of governmental control and the prescription-only basis on which it can be used
Document 9 (Title: Otoacoustic Emissions -- Issues of Concern -- Ototoxicity Monitoring): Over the last decade, OAE has been increasingly used to monitor the ototoxicity of medications, particularly aminoglycoside antibiotics and platinum-based chemotherapy agents. Ototoxic drugs affect the outer hair cells and are detectable on OAE before a conventional audiogram. Its quick application and cost efficiency make it a good clinical choice to follow patients during their therapeutic course. DPOAEs are more sensitive to the higher frequencies, which are commonly affected first in ototoxicity. Prior to starting ototoxic medications, patients should undergo baseline OAE testing and again with each dose of ototoxic medication. Changes of 2.4 dB or more are considered a significant decrease and indicate a change in cochlear function. [16]
Document 10 (Title: Torsemide -- Toxicity): Ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity occur with concomitant use of nephro or ototoxic medications. Animal studies have shown temporary ototoxicity with no permanent effect. [9] Further research is necessary for confirmation of temporary vs. permanent ototoxic effects in humans.
Document 11 (Title: Prostaglandins XI. alpha-Halo-alpha,beta-unsaturated ketones: a synthetic approach to 13-dehydroprostaglandins.): Synthesis of alpha-halo-alpha,beta-unsaturated ketones from aldehydes as a synthetic approach to prostaglandins is investigated.
Document 12 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): Antibiotics are also active against other protozoans. Tetracycline and erythromycin are alternative therapies for the treatment of intestinal amebiasis. Clindamycin, in combination with other agents, is effective therapy for toxoplasmosis, pneumocystosis, and babesiosis. Spiramycin is a macrolide antibiotic that is used to treat primary toxoplasmosis acquired during pregnancy. Treatment lowers the risk of the development of congenital toxoplasmosis. HALOFANTRINE, LUMEFANTRINE, & PYRONARIDINE Halofantrine hydrochloride, a phenanthrene-methanol, is effective against erythrocytic (but not other) stages of all four human malaria species. Oral absorption is variable and enhanced by food. Because of toxicity concerns, it should not be taken with meals. The half-life is about 4 days and excretion is mainly in the feces. Halofantrine is not available in the USA (although it has been approved by the FDA), but it is available in malaria-endemic countries.
Document 13 (Title: Halofantrine): Pharmacology The mechanism of action of halofantrine is unknown. The absorption of halofantrine is erratic, but is increased when taken with fatty food. Because of fears of toxicity due to increased halofantrine blood levels, halofantrine should be taken on an empty stomach. Plasma levels peak at 16 hours and the half-life of the drug is about 4 days. Uses Halofantrine is only used to treat malaria. It is not used to prevent malaria (prophylaxis) because of the risk of toxicity and unreliable absorption. Dosing Adult dose: three doses of 500 mg six hours apart. Halofantrine should be taken on an empty stomach. Manufacturing information and availability Halfan (GlaxoSmithKline) is available as 250 mg tablets. A full course of treatment (6 tablets) costs US$1.40 in the developing world. Halofantrine is not available in the UK or U.S. References Secondary alcohols Antimalarial agents Chloroarenes Trifluoromethyl compounds Phenanthrenes SRI International
Document 14 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Halofantrine This 9-phenanthrenemethanol is one of three classes of arylaminoalcohols first identified as potential antimalarial agents by the World War II Malaria Chemotherapy Program. Its activity is believed to be similar to that of chloroquine, although it is an oral alternative for the treatment of malaria due to chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum. Although the mechanism of action is poorly understood, halofantrine is thought to share mechanism(s) with the 4-aminoquinolines, forming a complex with ferriprotoporphyrin IX and interfering with the degradation of hemoglobin.
Document 15 (Title: Halofantrine): Halofantrine is a drug used to treat malaria. Halofantrine's structure contains a substituted phenanthrene, and is related to the antimalarial drugs quinine and lumefantrine. Marketed as Halfan, halofantrine is never used to prevent malaria and its mode of action is unknown, although a crystallographic study showed that it binds to hematin in vitro, suggesting a possible mechanism of action. Halofantrine has also been shown to bind to plasmepsin, a haemoglobin degrading enzyme unique to the malarial parasites. Halofantrine was developed at SRI International for the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research from 1965 to 1975 by a team led by medicinal chemist William Colwell. Adverse reactions Halofantrine can cause abdominal pain, diarrhoea, vomiting, rash, headache, itching and elevated liver enzymes.
