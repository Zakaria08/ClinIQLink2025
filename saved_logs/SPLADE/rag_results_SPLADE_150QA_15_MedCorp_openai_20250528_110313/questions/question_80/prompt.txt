Document 1 (Title: Influence of clerkship structure and timing on individual student performance.): Student oral and written surgical clerkship performances may be related to the clerkship structure and the time of year the students rotate through the clerkship. The influence of calendar block, hospital site (university hospital, affiliated private tertiary-care hospital, and rural preceptor experience), and the mix of general surgical versus subspeciality rotations on oral and written student surgery clerkship scores was analyzed. Multivariate analysis of variance revealed significant differences in score for calendar block (p = 0.02) only; this difference resided in the written examination. The various combinations of rotations were not different from one another in terms of measured outcome.
Document 2 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): surgeryLaparoscopic surgerySeamless surgeryProgress in surgeryfor all surgeons. This technology has the advantage of enabling objective measurement of psychomotor skills, which can be used to determine progress in skill acquisition and, ultimately, techni-cal competency.101 Several of these devices have been validated as a means of measuring proficiency in skill performance. More importantly, training on virtual reality platforms has proven to translate to improved operative performance in randomized tri-als.102,103 Currently, surgical skills labs are mandatory for Resi-dency Review Committee credentialing. Successful completion of the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS) technical and cognitive examination became a mandatory prerequisite for the American Board of Surgery (ABS) qualification examination in general surgery in 2010. The Fundamentals of Endoscopic Surgery (FES) became a prerequisite to ABS qualification in 2015. In the future, institutions may require simulator
Document 3 (Title: Operation Smile): Operation Smile offers education in safe surgical conditions in Ethiopia and Rwanda, where they have offered surgical training rotations for general surgeons to learn reconstructive plastic surgery techniques — since 2012 in Ethiopia and since 2015 in Rwanda. The two-week training courses for Ethiopian surgeons, anesthesiologists and nurses take place at JUSH (Jimma University Specialized Hospital), the only hospital serving the 15 million-plus people living in Ethiopia’s southwestern region. The rotations cover cleft surgery as well as techniques to better heal burn, trauma and surgical wounds, representing the bulk of the hospital’s plastic surgery cases.
Document 4 (Title: Mohs Micrographic Surgery Design and Execution of Rotation Flaps -- Continuing Education Activity): Objectives: Identify patients with primary surgical defects that may benefit from closure with a surgical rotational flap. Apply best practices when designing and executing a rotational flap during a Mohs micrographic surgical procedure. Evaluate and manage the common complications of surgical rotational flaps in Mohs micrographic surgery. Develop and implement effective interprofessional team strategies to improve cosmetic and functional outcomes for patients who have undergone rotational flap closure. Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.
Document 5 (Title: Mohs Micrographic Surgery Design and Execution of Rotation Flaps -- Continuing Education Activity): Mohs micrographic surgery creates defects requiring various closure techniques to optimize function and cosmesis in the cosmetic units of the face. Surgical rotational flaps are a subtype of random pattern cutaneous flaps that pivot into their final position, differing from traditional advancement flaps. A rotational flap may be indicated for triangular-shaped defects or those where the tension vector of the primary wound requires alteration. This activity reviews the indications, contraindications, complications, and surgical technique of designing and employing a surgical rotational flap in patients undergoing Mohs micrographic surgery and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients treated with this closure method.
Document 6 (Title: Geriatric education. Part I: Efficacy of a mandatory clinical rotation for fourth year medical students.): To describe the curriculum of a mandatory, fourth-year geriatrics clerkship and assess its impact on medical students' knowledge of geriatric medicine and attitudes toward the elderly. One group, before/after trial. Mount Sinai School of Medicine of the City University of New York. Entire fourth year class of medical students (n = 127). Four-week-long clinical geriatrics clerkship. Pre- and post-rotation: test of knowledge; Aging Semantic Differential (ASD) attitude scale; Modified Maxwell-Sullivan attitude scale; questionnaire. Seventy percent of students found the rotation to be educationally valuable; however, only one-third of students would have taken the clerkship had it not been required. Mean geriatric knowledge score increased by 18.7% (P less than 0.001). Mean ASD attitude score did not change significantly (130.5 +/- 19.2 pre-rotation versus 126.6 +/- 18.8 post-rotation, P = 0.15), but students started the rotation with a neutral attitude. Over 90% of students agreed they would welcome elderly into their future practice. If a national curricular goal is to improve medical students' knowledge of geriatric medicine, required rather than elective rotations may be in order.
Document 7 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): intervention may prove necessary in patients receiving anticoagulation therapy. Increasing experience suggests that surgical treatment can be undertaken without full reversal of the anticoagulant, depending on the procedure being performed.62 When the aPTT is less than 1.3 times control in a heparinized patient, or when the INR is less than 1.5 in a patient on warfarin, reversal of anticoagulation therapy may not be necessary. How-ever, meticulous surgical technique is mandatory, and the patient must be observed closely throughout the postoperative period.Certain surgical procedures should not be performed in concert with anticoagulation. In particular, cases where even minor bleeding can cause great morbidity, such as the central nervous system and the eye, surgery should be avoided. Emer-gency operations are occasionally necessary in patients who have been heparinized. The first step in these patients is to dis-continue heparin. For more rapid reversal, protamine sulfate is
Document 8 (Title: Medical school in the United States): The third and fourth years consist of clinical rotations, sometimes called clerkships, where students see patients in hospitals and clinics. These rotations are usually at teaching hospitals but are occasionally at community hospitals or with private physicians. Mandatory rotations in third year are often obstetrics and gynecology, pediatrics, psychiatry, family medicine, internal medicine, and surgery. During the third year, medical students take Step 2/Level 2 of the medical licensing boards. Fourth year rotations typically allow students to choose several electives and finish required rotations. It is also used as a period of auditioning for residency programs.
Document 9 (Title: Adhesive capsulitis of the shoulder): If these measures are unsuccessful, more aggressive interventions such as surgery can be trialed. Manipulation of the shoulder under general anesthesia to break up the adhesions is sometimes used. Hydrodilatation or distension arthrography is controversial. However, some studies show that arthrographic distension may play a positive role in reducing pain and improve range of movement and function. Surgery to cut the adhesions (capsular release) may be indicated in prolonged and severe cases; the procedure is usually performed by arthroscopy. Surgical evaluation of other problems with the shoulder, e.g., subacromial bursitis or rotator cuff tear, may be needed. Resistant adhesive capsulitis may respond to open release surgery. This technique allows the surgeon to find and correct the underlying cause of restricted glenohumeral movement such as contracture of coracohumeral ligament and rotator interval. Physical therapy may achieve improved results after surgical procedure and
Document 10 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): new technologies and methods become apparent only after widespread use.Multiple surgical specialties have begun or continue to develop their experiences using robotic surgery from general surgery procedures such as inguinal hernia repairs to pancreati-coduodenectomies to complex thoracic, urologic and ear, nose, and throat procedures. When robotic surgery goes awry, how-ever, the complications can be serious. The MAUDE (Manu-facturer and User Facility Device Experience) is an open access database where mandatory and voluntary adverse events are collected. As it relates to robotic surgery, some important infor-mation has been elucidated. Device failures (electrocautery, instrument malfunctions), make up roughly half of the com-plications. A retrospective study over the past 14 years in the United States documented over 10,000 robotic device-related complications that have occurred, of which 98% were reported by the manufacturers and distributers, and 2% were voluntary reports by
Document 11 (Title: Urology): Nepal In Nepal, the formal urologist degree awarded is MCh (Magister Chirurgiae). This is a three years course post masters and includes thesis and a mandatory publication. This degree is awarded after completing MBBS (four and half year plus a one-year rotatory internship) and MS (Mastery of surgery) in general surgery (three years course). Till now two Universities Tribhuvan University and Kathmandu University as well as two Autonomous institutes BP Koirala Institute of health sciences and National Academy of Medical Sciences (Bir Hospital) run the MCh Urology programme.19, 20 This degree is equivalent to Clinical PhD and called as "Chikitsa Bidhyabaridhi" by Tribhuvan University (Government University) and is considered to be the highest degree among the surgical discipline degrees. Besides Urology, Cardiothoracic and Vascular Surgery, Surgical Gastroenterology, Plastic Surgery, and Neurosurgery MCh programmes also run in the country.
Document 12 (Title: Rotator cuff tear): The three general surgical approaches are arthroscopic, mini open, and open-surgical repair. In the past, small tears were treated arthroscopically, while larger tears would usually require an open procedure. Advances in arthroscopy now allow arthroscopic repair of even the largest tears, and arthroscopic techniques are now required to mobilize many retracted tears. The results match open surgical techniques, while permitting a more thorough evaluation of the shoulder at time of surgery, increasing the diagnostic value of the procedure, as other conditions may simultaneously cause shoulder pain. Arthroscopic surgery also allows for shorter recovery time although differences in postoperative pain or pain medication use are not seen between arthroscopic- and open-surgery. A 2019 review found that the evidence does not support decompression surgery in those with more than 3 months of shoulder pain without a history of trauma.
Document 13 (Title: Gynecology_Novak): salpingitis can occur as a complication of the surgery. This occurs more often with electric coagulation than nonelectric techniques. Risk of death with female sterilization was 1 to 2 per 100,000 sterilizations in the last national study that was based on data from 1979 to 1980 (281). Almost half of the deaths were from complications of general anesthesia, usually related to the use of mask ventilation. When general anesthesia is used for laparoscopy, endotracheal intubation is mandatory because the pneumoperitoneum increases the risk of aspiration. International data from the Association for Voluntary Surgical Contraception show a similar record of safety from third world programs: 4.7 deaths per 100,000 female sterilizations and 0.5 deaths per 100,000 vasectomies (287).
Document 14 (Title: Mucocele and Ranula -- Consultations): Before the surgical excision of mucoceles or ranulas, it is mandatory to consult with a radiologist to help in defining the boundaries and extension of the lesion. This would prove to be of paramount significance for the surgeon in terms of a better outcome of the surgery by avoiding severe complications. Consultation with the anesthesiologist becomes necessary when the ranula is large enough to cause respiratory compromise.
Document 15 (Title: Radial Tunnel Syndrome -- Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes): Radial tunnel syndrome is best addressed through the efforts of an interprofessional team exercising open communication and coordinated activity. Proper communication between the peripheral nerve surgeon (neurosurgeon/orthopedic surgeon/plastic surgeon), physician (neurologist or general physician), radiologist, a neurophysiologist, and neuro/orthopedic nurse is mandatory for the diagnosis and management of this disease, as the differential diagnoses can be tricky at times. It is also essential to consider surgery, as many cases do not respond if the diagnosis is incorrect. Advanced imaging may be helpful in unclear cases, requiring radiologist input. Physical therapy can be an adjunct in both surgical and non-surgical cases. This interprofessional approach should improve patient outcomes. [Level 5]
