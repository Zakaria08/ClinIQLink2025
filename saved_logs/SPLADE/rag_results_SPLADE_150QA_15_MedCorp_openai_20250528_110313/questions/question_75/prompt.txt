Document 1 (Title: Amblyopia: etiology, detection, and treatment.): Amblyopia is a preventable cause of visual loss in children that may be permanent unless it is detected and treated early. It may be caused by strabismus, refractive errors, or cataracts. Primary strabismus may lead to loss of vision from amblyopia and the loss of binocularity. Secondary strabismus may be a sign of primary visual loss in one or both eyes. The most serious disorder that may present as secondary strabismus is retinoblastoma. It is imperative to detect retinoblastoma early because of its morbidity and mortality. Amblyopia is detected by assessing the visual acuity of each eye. Strabismus is detected by using the corneal light reflex test and the cover test. Focusing problems are detected by assessing the visual acuity and the red reflex. Cataracts and retinoblastoma may be detected by examining the red reflex of the eye. Treatment of amblyopia consists of correcting the amblyogenic factor with appropriate glasses and surgery. The preferred eye is patched with an adhesive patch to stimulate visual development in the amblyopic eye. The pediatrician plays a crucial role in the early detection of amblyopia, strabismus, and cataracts. The key to successful visual outcome is early recognition by the pediatrician, referral to the pediatric ophthalmologist, and prompt treatment.
Document 2 (Title: Visual impairment): Other Amblyopia: is a category of vision loss or visual impairment that is caused by factors unrelated to refractive errors or coexisting ocular diseases. Amblyopia is the condition when a child's visual systems fail to mature normally because the child either suffers from a premature birth, measles, congenital rubella syndrome, vitamin A deficiency, or meningitis. If left untreated during childhood, amblyopia is currently incurable in adulthood because surgical treatment effectiveness changes as a child matures. Consequently, amblyopia is the world's leading cause of child monocular vision loss, which is the damage or loss of vision in one eye. In the best case scenario, which is very rare, properly treated amblyopia patients can regain 20/40 acuity. Corneal opacification Degenerative myopia
Document 3 (Title: Neurology_Adams): Simultaneous impairment of vision in the two eyes, with central or centrocecal scotomas, is often caused by nutritional deficiency. This occurrence is observed most often in the chronically alcoholic or malnourished patient. Impairment of visual acuity evolves over several days to weeks, and examination discloses bilateral, roughly symmetrical central or centrocecal scotomas, with the peripheral fields being intact. With appropriate treatment (nutritious diet and vitamins B) instituted soon after the onset of visual loss, recovery is possible. If treatment is delayed, patients are left with varying degrees of permanent defect in central vision and pallor of the temporal portions of the optic discs. This disorder has been referred to as “tobacco-alcohol amblyopia,” the implication being that it is caused by the toxic effects of tobacco or alcohol or both. In fact, the problem is more likely one of nutritional deficiency and is more properly designated as deficiency amblyopia or
Document 4 (Title: Visual acuity): Proper development of normal visual acuity depends on a human or an animal having normal visual input when it is very young. Any visual deprivation, that is, anything interfering with such input over a prolonged period of time, such as a cataract, severe eye turn or strabismus, anisometropia (unequal refractive error between the two eyes), or covering or patching the eye during medical treatment, will usually result in a severe and permanent decrease in visual acuity and pattern recognition in the affected eye if not treated early in life, a condition known as amblyopia. The decreased acuity is reflected in various abnormalities in cell properties in the visual cortex. These changes include a marked decrease in the number of cells connected to the affected eye as well as cells connected to both eyes in cortical area V1, resulting in a loss of stereopsis, i.e. depth perception by binocular vision (colloquially: "3D vision"). The period of time over which an animal is highly sensitive
Document 5 (Title: Amblyopia -- Introduction): Amblyopia is a developmental disorder that affects vision. Characterized by neurodevelopmental alterations, amblyopia leads to physiological abnormalities in visual pathway development during early childhood, resulting in impaired vision occurring unilaterally or, less commonly, in both eyes. [1] This condition occurs when cortical visual development fails in one or both eyes early in life. Amblyopia is commonly known as a "lazy eye" among the general public. If left untreated, amblyopia can lead to permanent vision loss in the affected eye, even if the underlying ocular pathology is later resolved.
Document 6 (Title: Amblyopia -- Pathophysiology): Amblyopia is a neurodevelopmental condition that results in impaired best-corrected vision in one or both eyes. [21] The development of visual acuity in the postnatal period relies on continuous exposure to high-quality visual stimuli by both eyes and the proper functioning of the visual pathways. Research has pinpointed a sensitive or critical period during which amblyopia can develop due to incomplete visual pathway development, with a susceptibility window extending to approximately 7 to 10 years of age. [37] Any deviations from normal vision during the first decade of life caused by unilateral or bilateral blurred retinal images can lead to permanent vision loss if not promptly diagnosed and treated. [38]
Document 7 (Title: Obstentrics_Williams): Pregnancy does not alter management. Some recommend serial visual field testing to forestall permanent vision loss. In a report of 16 pregnant women, visual ield loss developed in four, and it became permanent in one (Huna-Baron, 2002). Visual ield loss is often coincident with the development of papilledema, for which acetazolamide is given. Lee and associates (2005) reported successful treatment of 12 pregnant women. Although outmoded for treatment of nonpregnant individuals, repeated lumbar punctures are generally successful in providing temporary relief throughout pregnancy. In some pregnant women, surgical therapy becomes necessary, and we and others have had promising results with optic nerve sheath fenestration (hambisetty, 2007).
Document 8 (Title: Inherited and developmental corneal disorders.): The cornea is one of the rare transparent tissues in nature. Its clarity and curvature are essential for clear and precise vision. This clarity may be adversely affected by a number of congenital and developmental conditions. It is important to recognize these defects early in order to prevent amblyopia, and, in many cases, to rule out congenital glaucoma or associated congenital or developmental disorders. Early treatment of corneal disorders may prevent permanent visual loss and can facilitate early visual rehabilitation.
Document 9 (Title: Neurology_Adams): Impairment of visual function, expressed as defects in acuity and alterations of visual fields, obviously stands as the most important symptom of eye disease. A number of terms are commonly used to describe visual loss. Amaurosis is a general term that refers to partial or complete loss of sight. Amblyopia refers to any monocular deficit in vision that occurs in the presence of normal ocular structures. A major cause of amblyopia is the suppression by the brain of vision from one eye during early childhood caused by either strabismus, anisometropia (a significant difference in refractive error), or by media opacities. Nyctalopia is a term for poor twilight or night vision and is associated with extreme myopia, cataracts, vitamin A deficiency, retinitis pigmentosa, and, often, color blindness. There are also a number of positive visual symptoms that are named based on their characteristics, phosphenes, migrainous scintillations, visual illusions, and hallucinations. Irritation,
Document 10 (Title: Giant Cell Arteritis (Temporal Arteritis) -- History and Physical -- Cranial Symptoms and Findings): Visual involvement: Approximately 20% to 30% of the patients experience visual disturbances. GCA-associated visual loss can be transient or permanent. Transient visual changes typically present as an abrupt partial field defect or as if a curtain covers the field of vision of 1 eye. Permanent vision loss, most often resulting from anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, is painless and sudden, and it can be unilateral, bilateral, partial, or complete. [13] Current studies estimate that the incidence of permanent vision loss is 8.2% in patients with GCA. [15] Fundoscopy initially reveals pallor and edema of the optic disc and, eventually, optic atrophy. In addition, the presence of retinal or choroidal ischemia strongly suggests GCA.
Document 11 (Title: Neurology_Adams): If intracranial hypertension and papilledema are left untreated or fail to respond to the measures outlined below, there is danger of permanent visual loss from compressive damage to the optic nerve fibers and compression of the central retinal veins. Corbett and associates, who described a group of 57 patients followed for 5 to 41 years, found severe visual impairment in 14, and Wall and George, using refined perimetric methods, reported an even higher incidence of visual loss. Moreover, children with pseudotumor share the same visual risks as adults (Lessell and Rosman). Sometimes, vision is lost abruptly, either without warning or following one or more episodes of monocular or binocular visual obscurations. Treatment of Pseudotumor Cerebri
Document 12 (Title: Optic Neuritis -- Complications): Permanent vision loss: While many patients recover their vision partially or fully after an episode of optic neuritis, some may suffer from permanent optic nerve damage. This nerve injury can result in persistent visual deficits, such as decreased visual acuity, color vision loss, and visual field defects. Despite treatment, about 3% to 5% of patients may not fully recover their vision.
Document 13 (Title: Quadrantanopia): The prospects of recovering vision in the affected field are bleak. Occasionally, patients will spontaneously recover vision in the affected field within the first three months after the brain injury; however, vision loss remaining after this period of spontaneous recovery is traditionally thought to be permanent, certain companies now claim to be able to induce recovery of vision after this three-month period. Homonymous inferior/superior quadrantanopia Homonymous denotes a condition which affects the same portion of the visual field of each eye. Homonymous inferior quadrantanopia is a loss of vision in the same lower quadrant of visual field in both eyes whereas a homonymous superior quadrantanopia is a loss of vision in the same upper quadrant of visual field in both eyes.
Document 14 (Title: Eyepatch): Medical uses Amblyopia Eye patching is used in the orthoptic management of children at risk of lazy eye (amblyopia), especially strabismic or anisometropic amblyopia. These conditions can cause visual suppression of areas of the dissimilar images by the brain such as to avoid diplopia, resulting in a loss of visual acuity in the suppressed eye and in extreme cases in blindness in an otherwise functional eye. Patching the good eye forces the amblyopic eye to function, thereby causing vision in that eye to be retained. It is important to perform "near activities" (such as reading or handiwork) when patched, thereby exercising active, attentive vision. A study provided evidence that children treated for amblyopia with eye patching had lower self-perception of social acceptance. To prevent a child from being socially marginalized by their peers due to wearing an eye patch, atropine eye drops may be used instead. This induces temporary blurring in the treated eye.
Document 15 (Title: Transient Loss of Vision -- Complications -- Permanent vision loss:): Retinal artery occlusion: If not promptly treated, this occlusion can cause permanent retinal damage and irreversible vision loss. Optic neuritis: Recurring optic neuritis, particularly in patients with multiple sclerosis, can lead to progressive and permanent visual impairment. [97]
