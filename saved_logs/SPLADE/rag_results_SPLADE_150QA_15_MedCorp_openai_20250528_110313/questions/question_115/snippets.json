The hepatorenal toxicity of acetaminophen is mediated by a reactive metabolite normally detoxified by reduced glutathione.

Oral or intravenous N-acetylcysteine or oral D,L-methionine mitigates acetaminophen-induced hepatorenal damage if given within 10 hours, but becomes less effective thereafter. In vivo, N-acetylcysteine forms L-cysteine, cystine, L-methionine, glutathione, and mixed disulfides; L-methionine also forms cysteine, thus giving rise to glutathione and other products. Oral therapy with N-acetylcysteine or methionine for acetaminophen poisoning is contraindicated in the presence of coma or vomiting, or if activated charcoal has been given by mouth. Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea may also occur as a result of oral N-acetylcysteine administration.

As indicated earlier, gastric aspiration and lavage with normal saline may be diagnostically and therapeutically useful in some instances of coma due to drug ingestion. Salicylates, opiates, and anticholinergic drugs (tricyclic antidepressants, phenothiazines, scopolamine), all of which induce gastric atony, may be recovered many hours after ingestion. Caustic materials should not be lavaged because of the danger of gastrointestinal perforation. The administration of activated charcoal is indicated in certain drug poisonings. Measures to prevent gastric hemorrhage and excessive gastric acid secretion are usually advisable. 8. The temperature-regulating mechanisms may be disturbed and extreme hypothermia or hyperthermia should be corrected. In severe hyperthermia, evaporative-cooling measures are indicated in addition to antipyretics."
