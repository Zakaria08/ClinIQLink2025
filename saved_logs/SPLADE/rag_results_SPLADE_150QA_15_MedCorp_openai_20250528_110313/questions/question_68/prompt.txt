Document 1 (Title: Madeline Cheek Hunter): Hunter identified seven components for teaching: knowledge of human growth and development content classroom management materials planning human relations instructional skills Hunter also developed a direct instructional model and elements of effective instruction. The instructional model has seven components: objectives standards anticipatory set teaching (input, modeling, checking for understanding) guided practice/monitoring closure independent practice The elements of effective instruction are very similar to those of the instructional model, featuring seven components of teaching and behavioral objectives: objectives set(hook) standards/expectations teaching (input, modeling/demo, direction giving, and checking for understanding) guided practice closure independent practice Hunter was the creator of Instructional Theory into Practice (ITIP). ITIP is a teaching model on inservice/staff development program widely used during the 1970s and 1980s.

Document 3 (Title: The use of a teaching model to promote reflection and the experiential integration of theory and practice in first-year student nurses: an action research study.): This study developed and evaluated an experiential teaching model which aimed to improve the integration of theory and practice for first-year RGN students. This work took a qualitative approach and used Lewin's action research methodology. Using a participant observation approach, data, in the form of diaries, interviews and spot checks, were gathered. To evaluate the teaching model, the spot checks were developed as an indicator of theory-practice integration. The analysis of these spot checks revealed that this teaching approach had value. The strengths and weaknesses of the teaching model, in relation to possible origins of the theory-practice gap, are outlined. The validity of action research is discussed, as are similar issues that are related to the methodology of this study.
Document 4 (Title: Task Trainers in Procedural Skills Acquisition in Medical Simulation -- Curriculum Development): Using a task trainer can allow for the creation of a simple teaching model leading to a standardized teaching approach and, ultimately, a sustainable outcome. For many years, the standard of practice in the medical community has been Halstead's "See one, Do one, Teach one" but this has become less acceptable, particularly when invasive procedures and high-risk care are involved. [4] [5] A more efficient model for teaching procedures that combines multiple aspects of adult learning is Peyton's 4 step approach (see Figure 1). [6] In this model, a teacher can demonstrate the procedure on the task trainer to the learner with no commentary as the first step.
Document 5 (Title: Nursing Professional Development Evidence-Based Practice -- Issues of Concern -- EBP Models): The most frequently used EBP models are the Iowa Model, the Advancing Research and Clinical Practice through Close Collaboration (ARCC) Model, the Star Model of Knowledge Transformation, and the John Hopkins Nursing Evidence-based Practice (JHNEBP) Model. The IOWA Model focuses on implementing evidence-based practice changes, and the ARCC model on advancing EBP in systems by using EBP mentors and control and cognitive behavioral therapies. The Star Model provides a framework for approaching EBP, and the John Hopkins Model is a problem-based approach to clinical decision-making accompanied by tools to guide its use.
Document 6 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): Ludovisi Collection, Accession number Inv. 8575, Palazzo Altemps, Location Ground Floor, Branch of the National Roman Museum. Photographer/-source Jastrow [2006] from Wikipedia.)Choosing wisely requires the virtue of practical wisdom first described by Aristotle (see Fig. 48-1). Along with the other cardinal virtues of courage, justice and temperance, practical wisdom is a central component of virtue ethics which comple-ment principalist ethics by guiding choices toward the best options for treatment. Practical wisdom cannot be learned from books and is developed only through experience. The appren-ticeship model of surgical residency fosters the development of practical wisdom through experience. More than teaching merely technical mastery, surgical residency is also moral training. In fact, the sociologist Charles Bosk argues that the “postgraduate training of surgeons is above all things an ethical training.”3SPECIFIC ISSUES IN SURGICAL ETHICSInformed ConsentAlthough a relatively
Document 7 (Title: A model for faculty practice teaching clinics developed at the Oregon Health Sciences University.): In 1988 the Oregon Health Sciences University established its first faculty practice teaching clinic wherein physicians in training were incorporated into a faculty private practice clinic; this pilot project proved very successful and has been subsequently adopted as the model for essentially all outpatient clinics (both medical and surgery) in the university system. The model encourages efficiency, overhead control, and appropriate staffing; it also compensates faculty members for their additional time spent teaching. The authors conclude this model may help other academic training centers adapt to the changing demands of medical education.
Document 8 (Title: Reflective practice): Many writers advocate for teacher educators themselves to act as models of reflective practice. This implies that the way that teacher educators teach their students needs to be congruent with the approaches they expect their students to adopt with pupils; teacher educators should not only model the way to teach, but should also explain why they have chosen a particular approach whilst doing so, by reference to theory; this implies that teacher educators need to be aware of their own tacit theories of teaching and able to connect them overtly to public theory. However, some teacher educators do not always "teach as they preach"; they base their teaching decisions on "common sense" more than on public theory and struggle with modelling reflective practice.
Document 9 (Title: Nursing Professional Development Evidence-Based Practice -- Issues of Concern -- EBP Models): The Iowa model was revised and updated in 2017 by the Iowa Model Collaborative. [6] Changes in the healthcare environment, such as a focus on implementation science and emphasis on patient engagement, prompted a reevaluation, revision, and validation of the model. This model differs from other frameworks by linking practice changes within the system. Model changes included an expansion of piloting, implementation, patient engagement, and sustaining change. Support for the ARCC Model was outlined in an article by Melnyk and colleagues in a study exploring how an evidence-based culture and mentorship predicted EBP implementation, nurse job satisfaction, and intent to stay. [7] This model involves assessing organizational culture and readiness for EBP using EBP mentors who work with clinicians to facilitate the implementation of evidence-based practice.
Document 10 (Title: Nursing Professional Development Evidence-Based Practice -- Issues of Concern -- EBP Models): Lee and Park completed a concept analysis of feelings of entrapment during the COVID-19 pandemic using the ACE Star Model. The ACE Star model is used to understand the cycle, nature, and characteristics of knowledge used in various aspects of EBP. The model consists of five steps: discovery research, evidence summary, translation to guidelines, practice integration, and process and outcome evaluation. The JHNEBP Model is a problem-solving approach to clinical decision-making with user-friendly tools for individual or group use. It is explicitly designed to meet the needs of the practicing nurse and uses a 3-step process called PET: practice question, evidence, and translation. In a study conducted by Speroni and colleagues on using EBP models across the United States, this was the second most frequently used model by the 127 nurse leaders who responded to the questionnaire. [8]
Document 11 (Title: Teaching models in an ambulatory training program.): Ambulatory care training is increasingly important in internal medicine. Such training centers on the practice where residents and faculty see their patients; thus, features of the practice model influence what residents learn. A resident-faculty group practice affiliated with a division of general internal medicine has many advantages. In such a practice, learning centers on resident-patient interactions, around which a comprehensive teaching program must be built. Major features of such a program include the mentoring of residents by faculty who work with them longitudinally and the presence of a well-balanced structured curriculum addressing clinical and nonclinical topics related to patient care. Teaching residents to interact and communicate with patients is crucial; approaches include role-modeling by faculty, use of videotaping, and role-playing and other innovative methods. Feedback is integral to learning and helps shape the attitudes and values that permeate residents' practices.
Document 12 (Title: Teacher education): Modelling The way in which teacher educators teach has a greater impact on student teachers’ thinking about practice than what teacher educators teach. So, teacher educators need to be able to model the competences and attributes they wish their students to adopt. Swennen et al. (2008). concluded that, in order to ‘model’ what they teach, teacher educators need to develop the ability to link their own (tacit) theories and practice of teaching to public theory, i.e., in Korthagen’s words, to translate Theory with a capital ‘T’ to theory with a small ‘t’. Meta-reflection Just as teaching is no longer seen as simply transferring factual information, so educating teachers also requires a more sophisticated approach, based upon professional awareness that comes from reflective practice. For Loughran, being a professional teacher educator requires “genuinely reflecting on, and responding to, the needs, demands, and expectations of teaching about teaching within the academy”.
Document 13 (Title: Applying the concept of the reflective practitioner to understanding and teaching family medicine.): This article contends that what makes family practice unique as a medical specialty is not so much its content (eg, continuity of care, broad range of patient population) as it is the process of clinical practice (ie, how the specialty is actually practiced in ongoing patient encounters). However, insufficient attention has been paid to critically analyzing and interpreting this process. We present a model derived from other "practice professions," such as architecture, known as reflection-in-action. This model is offered as a way of first apprehending and subsequently teaching the "professional artistry" which constitutes a critical component of family practice. Specific teaching approaches designed to enhance reflective medical practice are delineated.

Document 15 (Title: Model (art)): Experienced models work for many employers, gaining a wider knowledge of methods and practices than most individual artists or art teachers. Many models are visual artists themselves, and come to think of modeling as part of their visual arts practice, or as a creative activity in its own right. Emotional work In social science terms, participants in the art world where the art model is recognized as having a valuable role are a sub-culture, with norms of behavior and a definition of the situation that ideally support models' being proud of their work. However, stereotypes and prejudices of the larger culture may threaten these norms and definitions. Pride in being a model comes from identification with fine arts education and creativity as having social value, and is dependent on the quality of teaching, which models experience first-hand in a myriad of settings.
