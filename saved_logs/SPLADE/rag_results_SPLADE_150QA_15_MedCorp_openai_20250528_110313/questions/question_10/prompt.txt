Document 1 (Title: Pediatrics_Nelson): Decongestants, taken orally or intranasally, may be used to relieve nasal congestion. Oral medications, such as pseudoephedrine and phenylephrine, are available either alone or in combination with antihistamines. Adverse effects of oral decongestants include insomnia, nervousness, irritability, tachycardia, tremors, and palpitations. For older children participating in sports, oral decongestant use may be restricted. Topical nasal decongestant sprays are effective for immediate relief of nasal obstruction but should be used for less than 5 to 7 days to prevent rebound nasal congestion (rhinitis medicamentosa). Topical ipratropium bromide, an anticholinergic nasalspray, is used primarily for nonallergic rhinitis and rhinitis associated with viral upper respiratory infection. Leukotrienemodifiers have been studied in the treatment of allergic rhinitis. Montelukast is approved for use in seasonal allergicrhinitis.
Document 2 (Title: Decongestant): A decongestant, or nasal decongestant, is a type of pharmaceutical drug that is used to relieve nasal congestion in the upper respiratory tract. The active ingredient in most decongestants is either pseudoephedrine or phenylephrine (the latter of which has disputed effectiveness). Intranasal corticosteroids can also be used as decongestants and antihistamines can be used to alleviate runny nose, nasal itch, and sneezing. Topical decongestants on topical application as dilute solution (0.05–0.1%) produce local vasoconstriction. Regular use of decongestants for long periods should be avoided because mucosal ciliary function is impaired: atrophic rhinitis and anosmia (loss of the sense of smell) can occur due to persistent vasoconstriction.
Document 3 (Title: Clinical evaluation of triamcinolone acetonide nasal aerosol in children with perennial allergic rhinitis.): Triamcinolone acetonide aerosol (TAA), a topical corticosteroid, now available for intranasal use, has been shown to be highly effective in the treatment of both seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis (PAR) in adults. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of TAA in children, 210 patients (ages 4 to 12 years) with PAR were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups (placebo, TAA 82.5 micrograms/day, or TAA 165 micrograms/day). Medication was given tid over 12 weeks in a double-blind fashion. Response to medication was evaluated using symptom scoring, physician evaluation, and, in 44 patients, nasal airflow determinations by anterior rhinomanometry. The higher dose of TAA (165 micrograms/day) significantly improved rhinitis symptoms relative to placebo: the total nasal symptom score and most individual symptom scores (eg, nasal stuffiness, itch, sneezing) were significantly better, duration of rhinitis symptoms (hours per day) was significantly reduced, and nasal airflow in a subset of patients showed significant improvement. The lower dose of TAA (82.5 micrograms/day) was superior to placebo by the same parameters as the higher dose, but this improvement was not as consistently significant as the higher dose. There were no clinically significant adverse events; nasal irritation and epistaxis were rare with a similar incidence among treatment groups. In conclusion, TAA at 165 micrograms/day was effective in controlling the symptoms of PAR and in improving nasal airflow in pediatric patients; the lower dose (82.5 micrograms/day) was marginally effective. Both doses were safe and well-tolerated in the children studied.
Document 4 (Title: Rhinitis Medicamentosa -- Introduction): Topical decongestants are typically used in the relief of nasal congestion due to allergic rhinitis, acute or chronic rhinosinusitis, nasal polyps, or upper respiratory tract infection. The earliest nasal decongestants mainly derived from ephedrine, where there were reports of rebound congestion after prolonged use. This situation was found to develop as early as 3 days and up to 4 to 6 weeks of use. [1] However, with the emergence of modern vasoconstrictors, such as the imidazoline derivatives, the risk of developing RM is considered to be small or non-existent.
Document 5 (Title: Oxymetazoline): Oxymetazoline, sold under the brand name Afrin among others, is a topical decongestant and vasoconstrictor medication. It is available over-the-counter as a nasal spray to treat nasal congestion and nosebleeds, as eyedrops to treat eye redness due to minor irritation, and (in the United States) as a prescription topical cream to treat persistent facial redness due to rosacea in adults. Its effects begin within minutes and last for up to 6 hours. Intranasal use for longer than three days may cause congestion to recur or worsen, resulting in physical dependence.
Document 6 (Title: Fexofenadine -- Indications -- FDA-Approved Indications): Seasonal allergic rhinitis: Seasonal allergic rhinitis is characterized by nasal itching, sneezing, rhinorrhea, and nasal congestion. However, antihistamines are typically less effective in relieving nasal congestion. Triggers for seasonal or perennial allergic rhinitis may include grass, pollens, dust, pet dander, and mold. [2] In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial, fexofenadine demonstrated comparable safety and efficacy to loratadine. Notably, fexofenadine was found to be effective in alleviating ocular and nasal congestion symptoms. [3] According to the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, & Immunology (AAAAI), clinicians may consider supplementing treatment with pseudoephedrine if allergic rhinitis and nasal congestion persist despite oral antihistamine use. The fixed-dose combination of fexofenadine and pseudoephedrine has proven to be beneficial. [4]
Document 7 (Title: Rhinitis Medicamentosa -- Treatment / Management): The treatment of RM involves the discontinuation of the topical decongestant. Patients must receive counsel that the nasal congestion may temporarily worsen upon discontinuation of the topical decongestant so that they do not perceive it as treatment failure. The use of intranasal corticosteroids has been reported to minimize the symptoms of rebound congestion in both animal studies and several small human trials. [2] Other treatment modalities during withdrawal period involve the use of short-course oral corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone, 0.5 mg per kg for five days), oral antihistamines and inferior turbinate steroid injections, oral adenosine and mast cell stabilizing agents; however, these recommendations are based on limited case reports. [2]
Document 8 (Title: The effect of chronic cocaine abuse on human olfaction.): Cocaine has been used for many decades as both a stimulant and as a topical anesthetic/vasoconstrictor. Illicit "snorting" or freebase smoking has increased markedly in recent years. Decreased olfaction has been an often reported subjective complaint of cocaine abusers, but quantification of smell loss using sensitive psychophysical tests has not yet been done, leading to the present study. Eleven cocaine abusers were recruited from a drug treatment clinic. Olfaction was assessed using a butanol threshold test, the UPSIT, and a 7-item discrimination test. One patient tested anosmic, one had a mild discrimination problem, and one had a large septal perforation but was normosmic. From the present study, it appears that most cocaine abusers, even heavy users or those with intranasal damage, do not develop permanent olfactory dysfunction. It is not clear what factors may have resulted in complaints of olfactory loss in previous studies.
Document 9 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): sodium, a nasal spray, is essentially without side effects and is used prophylactically on a continuous basis during the season. Intranasal high-potency glucocorticoids are the most potent drugs available for the relief of established rhinitis, seasonal or perennial, and are effective in relieving nasal congestion. They provide efficacy with substantially reduced side effects as compared with this same class of agent administered orally. Their most frequent side effect is local irritation, with Candida overgrowth being a rare occurrence. The currently available intranasal glucocorticoids— beclomethasone, flunisolide, triamcinolone, budesonide, fluticasone propionate, fluticasone furoate, ciclesonide, and mometasone furoate—are equally effective for nasal symptom relief, including nasal congestion; these agents all achieve up to 70% overall symptom relief with some variation in the time period for onset of benefit. Topical ipratropium is an anticholinergic agent effective in reducing
Document 10 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): medicamentosa) and such systemic responses as hypertension. Oral α-adrenergic agonist decongestants containing pseudoephedrine are standard for the management of nasal congestion, generally in combination with an antihistamine. While oral antihistamines typically reduce nasal and ocular symptoms by about one-third, pseudoephedrine must be added to achieve a similar reduction in nasal congestion. These pseudoephedrine combination products can cause insomnia and are precluded from use in patients with narrow angle glaucoma, urinary retention, severe hypertension, marked coronary artery disease, or a first-trimester pregnancy. The CysLT1 blocker montelukast is approved for treatment of both seasonal and perennial rhinitis, and it reduces both nasal and ocular symptoms by about 20%. Cromolyn sodium, a nasal spray, is essentially without side effects and is used prophylactically on a continuous basis during the season. Intranasal high-potency glucocorticoids are the most potent drugs
Document 11 (Title: New directions and dimensions in the treatment of allergic rhinitis.): Physicians who treat patients with allergic rhinitis have a number of therapeutic options, including antihistamines, decongestants, cromolyn, anticholinergics, corticosteroids, and immunotherapy. Antihistamines are widely used for the treatment of mild allergic rhinitis and are often effective, although more severe cases will require other medications. The newer antihistamines may induce less drowsiness, which is the most prominent side effect of the older antihistamines. Topical nasal decongestants give fast relief from nasal congestion, but their overuse may result in rebound congestion. Because their efficacy in allergic rhinitis is variable, oral decongestants are usually used in combination with antihistamines. Nasal cromolyn is effective for many patients with allergic rhinitis, but its effect is variable and it is useful in severe allergic rhinitis.
Document 12 (Title: Management of allergic rhinitis: focus on intranasal agents.): The clinical manifestations of allergic rhinitis are the result of an immune-mediated process after exposure of a sensitized individual to airborne allergens. The primary symptomatology includes nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, nasal and conjunctival pruritus, and sneezing. Principles of management include allergen avoidance, palliative therapy, immunotherapy, and pharmacotherapy. Oral decongestants stimulate alpha-adrenergic receptors in the nasal cavity, resulting in vasoconstriction and decreased edema. Oral antihistamines block histamine1 (H1) receptors, and may relieve rhinorrhea, sneezing, and nasal and conjunctival pruritus. Topical decongestants have a local effect on adrenergic receptors in the nasal mucosa, resulting in rapid, marked vasoconstriction. Intranasal corticosteroids inhibit mediator release from mast cells and basophils, and reduce edema of the nasal mucosa. Dexamethasone sodium phosphate, beclomethasone dipropionate, and flunisolide are currently available for intranasal administration. Cromolyn sodium inhibits allergen-induced degranulation and mediator release from sensitized cells, and is useful primarily as a prophylactic agent. Several agents, including the corticosteroids budesonide and flucortin butylester, the mast cell-stabilizing agent nedocromil sodium, the anticholinergic agent ipratropium bromide, and the H1 receptor antagonist levocabastine are being investigated for intranasal use in the management of allergic rhinitis.
Document 13 (Title: Rhinitis medicamentosa): Rhinitis medicamentosa (or RM) is a condition of rebound nasal congestion suspected to be brought on by extended use of topical decongestants (e.g., oxymetazoline, phenylephrine, xylometazoline, and naphazoline nasal sprays) and certain oral medications (e.g., sympathomimetic amines and various 2-imidazolines) that constrict blood vessels in the lining of the nose, although evidence has been contradictory. Presentation The characteristic presentation of RM involves nasal congestion without rhinorrhea, postnasal drip, or sneezing following several days of decongestant use. This condition typically occurs after 5–7 days of use of topical decongestants. Patients often try increasing both the dose and the frequency of nasal sprays upon the onset of RM, worsening the condition. The swelling of the nasal passages caused by rebound congestion may eventually result in permanent turbinate hypertrophy, which may block nasal breathing until surgically removed.
Document 14 (Title: Sinus Endoscopic Surgery -- Complications -- Epistaxis): Minimal bleeding for a few days postoperatively is normal, but in cases of profuse bleeding, intervention is needed. The patient should be stabilized, and in cases of severe bleeding, the airway should be protected initially. The nose is examined to identify the site of bleeding. Options for managing epistaxis include topical vasoconstrictors, resorbable or non-resorbable packing, and cautery ( silver nitrate or electrocautery). In severe cases with persistent and recurrent bleeding not controlled with the previously mentioned options, surgical arterial ligation or endovascular embolization is considered the next step. [21] The surgeon should have a thorough knowledge of the anatomy of the blood supply to the nasal cavity. The sphenopalatine artery enters the nasal cavity through the sphenopalatine foramen (SPF) located at the posterior end of the middle turbinate; this artery can be ligated in cases of severe posterior epistaxis.
Document 15 (Title: Pentigetide nasal solution: a multicenter study evaluating efficacy and safety in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis.): The safety and efficacy of pentigetide (Pentyde) nasal solution, administered as 1 mg into each nostril four times daily, was compared with placebo for controlling symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rhinitis. This was a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group trial involving 431 patients divided equally between pentigetide and placebo treatment. The study was conducted during the 1986 spring allergy season and consisted of 1 week of baseline followed by 2 weeks of treatment. Physicians evaluated the frequency and severity of nasal symptoms at study entry (day 1) and the final visit (day 22). Physicians and patients assessed the global condition of the patient at the end of the study and patients also recorded the severity of symptoms in a daily diary. Pentigetide-treated patients showed a statistically significant greater reduction in the frequency (P = .004) and severity (P = .05) of total nasal symptom score (sneezing, nasal congestion, and rhinorrhea) and in the individual nasal symptom scores compared with placebo-treated patients. Diary results showed consistently lower total nasal symptom scores on each treatment day for pentigetide-treated patients (P = .02). Both the physicians and patients globally rated more pentigetide-treated patients improved than placebo-treated patients. The incidence and types of adverse experiences were similar between treatment groups and there were no reports of sedation or fatigue in the pentigetide group. No clinically significant changes occurred for laboratory tests, physical examination parameters or vital sign measurements. Pentigetide nasal solution was safe and effective for the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis.
