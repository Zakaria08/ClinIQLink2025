Document 1 (Title: Sociology of law): Lawrence M. Friedman is among socio-legal scholars who introduced the idea of legal culture into the sociology of law. For Friedman, legal culture "refers to public knowledge of and attitudes and behaviour patterns toward the legal system". It can also consist of "bodies of custom organically related to the culture as a whole. Friedman stresses the plurality of legal cultures and points out that one can explore legal cultures at different levels of abstraction, e.g. at the level of the legal system, the state, the country, or the community. Friedman is also known for introducing the distinction between the "internal" and "external" legal cultures. Somewhat oversimplified, the former refers to the general attitudes and perceptions of law among the functionaries of the legal system, such as the judiciary, while the latter can refer to the attitude of the citizenry to the legal system or to law and order generally.
Document 2 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): The Bell Commission recom-mended that residents work no more than 80 hours per week and no more than 24 consecutive hours per shift, and that a senior physician needed to be physically present in the hospital at all times. These recommendations were adopted by New York State in 1989. In 2003, the Accreditation Council on Graduate Medi-cal Education followed by mandating that all residency training programs adhere to the reduced work hour schedule.understand and deliver safe patient care. In fact, culture (col-lective attitudes and beliefs of caregivers) is increasingly being recognized to be the fourth measurable component to the structure-process-outcome model. This recognition is based on growing evidence that local culture is linked to a variety of important clinical outcomes.10 For any new patient safety initiative to be deemed successful, any change in structure or process must lead to a corresponding positive change in patient outcomes.11CREATING A CULTURE OF SAFETYCulture is to
Document 3 (Title: Sexual Harassment and Prevention Training -- Issues of Concern -- Organizational Culture - Most Potent Predictor): Although individual behavioral changes can yield meaningful results, wholesale cultural transformation is key to preventing sexual harassment. The employer should design a culture based on mutual respect, inclusion, and dignity. Improving transparency and accountability, clearly communicating a code of conduct that forbids unacceptable behavior, outlining punitive repercussions, and promoting a zero-tolerance attitude help define an anti-harassment culture. [19] Senior faculty should be encouraged to intervene when they become aware of harassing conduct because they can be role models and positively impact those involved.
Document 4 (Title: What Irish schoolchildren know about AIDS.): AIDS in the Republic of Ireland has so far mainly been associated with intravenous drug use. However, because of growing public pressure to mount an AIDS campaign aimed at potentially vulnerable sub-groups, we conducted a survey of knowledge and attitudes related to AIDS among 891 Irish schoolchildren in the senior years of secondary school. Although virtually none of the children had received any classroom education on AIDS and no national education programme had been undertaken at the time of the survey, levels of knowledge were high among the pupils studied, and compared favourably with levels found using the same questionnaire among San Franciscan pupils. Higher levels of knowledge were found among urban pupils and, although some sex differences in knowledge emerged, there was no consistent pattern in these. No school surveyed showed sufficient misinformation to warrant a systematic education programme.
Document 5 (Title: Sexuality of nurses: correlations of knowledge, attitudes, and behavior.): In a study of relationships among knowledge, attitudes, and statements of nursing behavior about sexuality, degree of comfort with sexual situations was measured with a Professional Sexual Role Inventory (PSRI), using ridit analysis. The PSRI and the Sex Knowledge and Attitude Test were administered in groups to 107 professional family planning nurses and 64 senior nursing students. The major hypothesis--the more knowledge a nurse has of human sexuality, the more favorable will be her attitude toward it and the more comfortable she will be in professional situations with sexual overtones--was supported. Significant positive correlations between sexual knowledge and attitudes and written responses indicated comfort in handling sexual situations. Analyses of variance of the test scores--by age, race, marital status, religion, religiosity, frequency of church attendance, and urbanization--demonstrated areas of sexuality which might be incorporated into nursing inservice training and education.
Document 6 (Title: Relationship of self-concept to nutrient intake and eating patterns in young women.): The relationships between attitudes toward oneself (self-concept) and nutrition-related behavior were examined for 153 single women aged 18 to 35 years. Nutrition-related behaviors were assessed with 3-day food records that were analyzed for nutrient composition and eating patterns (Basic Four Food Group scores, number of meals per day, and percent of energy from meals and snacks). Attitudes toward self, knowledge and attitudes about nutrition, and general health practices were assessed with a written questionnaire that incorporated several existing scales. Because of potential overlap among the three self-concept scales, as well as nutrition-attitude and health-practice items, responses were factor analyzed, yielding 14 factors. These factors were then compared with nutrient intake and eating patterns. Scores for the seemingly desirable factors of the "Super Person" or "Do Your Own Thing" were negatively correlated with intake of several nutrients; scores on the self-perception of a "Traditional" orientation to life were positively related to calcium intake and meal patterns. The "Nutrition Is Important" and "Nutrition Knowledge" factors were also positively related to desirable eating patterns and nutrient intakes. We conclude that several self-concept variables, as well as nutrition attitudes and knowledge, can potentially influence nutrient intakes and eating patterns in young women.
Document 7 (Title: Neurobiology of Addiction -- Clinical Significance -- Lessening Negative Attitudes): Leveraging the neurobiology of addiction is a powerful tool in reducing addiction-related stigma among healthcare providers. A deeper understanding of the biological underpinnings of substance use disorders can help shift attitudes from moral judgment to a more compassionate perspective. Clinical research has consistently shown clinicians foster negative attitudes toward patients suffering from substance use disorders. [48] A systematic review revealed that clinicians who endorsed negative attitudes delivered suboptimal care for patients with substance use disorders. [49]
Document 8 (Title: Techniques and Strategies in Ultrasound Simulation  -- Curriculum Development): In this regard, an approach to curriculum development of simulation-based POCUS should include establishing comprehensive learning objectives. One such objective commonly used in medical and healthcare education is Bloom's taxonomy of learning, which emphasizes 3 main categories: knowledge, skills, and attitudes. Knowledge commonly reflects the assimilation of learned information. The skills category denotes the development of psychomotor and coordinated aspects of machine and examiner interaction. Attitudes represent the combination of knowledge and skills related to learners integrating concepts into clinical decision-making and professional behavior. [6]
Document 9 (Title: First_Aid_Step2): Avoid power struggles. Give clear recommendations, but do not push patients into decisions. Ask about attitudes, mood variability, activities, and reaction to stress. Patients have chronic problems dealing with responsibilities, roles, and stressors. They may also deny their behavior, have diff culty understanding the cause of their problems, have diffculty changing their behavior patterns, and frequently refuse psychiatric care. Psychotherapy is the mainstay of therapy. Pharmacotherapy is reserved for cases with comorbid mood, anxiety, or psychotic signs/symptoms. Characterized by hallucinations, delusions, disordered thoughts, behavioral disturbances, and disrupted social functioning with a clear sensorium.
Document 10 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): at least 15 years, there are surprisingly few studies of simulation-based surgical training that can be described as Kirkpatrick level 4. On the other hand, there are numerous studies showing that clinician performance during the course of clinical care is improved after simulation training (Kirkpatrick level 3).

Document 11 (Title: Body Image Distortion (Archived) -- Etiology -- Factors Affecting Body Image and Body Image Disorders): Family plays an important role in the development of children’s body image, body size attitudes, and eating patterns, as they form in early childhood. Family is a prominent and continuing influence, as children develop the need for parental admiration and approval. Parents may increase or decrease the risk of the development of body image and eating concerns in their children, directly or indirectly. Parents with particular attention toward weight control behaviors have significant influences on children’s body satisfaction. Direct parental attitudes can include commenting to a child about their weight or appearance, teasing about a child’s weight, pressuring a child to lose weight, or encouraging a child to diet. Indirect parental behaviors are actions or attitudes that are not necessarily planned to influence the child, including parents’ negative comments about their bodies and parental engagement in excessive exercise or dieting. These behaviors may model self-criticism and inspire children to judge themselves or others based on appearance and highlight the importance of adhering to social and cultural body size ideals. Some other family features may also contribute to body satisfaction, such as the socioeconomic status of the family and living in large cities. [1] [17]

Document 13 (Title: From high school to college: changes in women's self-concept and its relationship to eating problems.): A longitudinal panel study of a sample of college women was undertaken to assess changes in women's self-concept from high school to college and during their college years and the relationship between changes in self-concept ratings and eating disorders. Self-concept was measured at Time Change 1 (senior year of high school to sophomore year of college), Time Change 2 (sophomore year of college to senior year of college), and Time Change 3 (senior year of high school to senior year of college) using Brownfain's (1952) self-rating scale. Eating behavior in college was measured at two points, sophomore and senior year, by the Eating Attitudes Test (Garner, Olmsted, Bohr, &amp; Garfinkel, 1982). The women were placed into three eating groups: Group 1 (eating pattern becomes or remains abnormal). Group 2 (eating pattern gets better), and Group 3 (eating pattern remains normal). Results revealed that all women's self-concept ratings declined in Time 1 with only a slight increase on a few traits in Time 2. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed that Group 1 experienced a significant overall decline in self-concept ratings between Time 1 and Time 3 compared with Group 2 and Group 3. Group 2 reported significantly greater increases in assertiveness at Time 1 compared with Group 3. We suggest an interactional model for understanding the relationship between self-concept and eating problems.

Document 15 (Title: Robert N. Butler): He graduated from Columbia College of Columbia University, where he was editor of the Columbia Daily Spectator and a member of the Philolexian Society. Career Butler was a principal investigator of one of the first interdisciplinary, comprehensive, longitudinal studies of healthy community-residing older persons, conducted at the National Institute of Mental Health (1955–1966), which resulted in the landmark book Human Aging. His research helped establish the fact that senility was not inevitable with aging, but is a consequence of disease. In 1969, he coined the term ageism to describe discrimination against seniors; the term was patterned on sexism and racism. Butler defined "ageism" as a combination of three connected elements. Among them were prejudicial attitudes towards older people, old age, and the aging process; discriminatory practices against older people; and institutional practices and policies that perpetuate stereotypes about elderly people.
