After a short period hyperkaliaemia a rapid decrease of potassium in the serum was observed 3-12 hours after administration of digoxin. This loss of potassium was due to an increased excretion of potassium and sodium in the urine. It is thought that a reversible tubular leakage is responsible for the loss of electrolytes by the kidney rather than an inhibition of the ATPase in kidney tissue. From our observations the following therapy scheme for digitalis-intoxication is recommended: 1. Gastric lavage and administration of absorbents (charcoal, cholestyramin) in order to decrease the absorption of the glycosides and to interrupt the enterohepatic circulation. 2. Substitution of electrolytes by infusions and by oral route to balance sodium and potassium levels in the serum. 3. Administration of diphenylhydantoin for treatment of cardiac arrhythmias. 4.

Volume expansion not only corrects the hemodynamic instability but also improves insulin sensitivity and reduces counter-regulatory hormone levels. After starting with isotonic saline, the subsequent options can be decided on the serum sodium levels that are corrected for the level of hyperglycemia. Normal or high serum sodium levels warrant replacement with hypotonic saline, and low sodium levels warrant continuation of the isotonic saline.

Along with fluids, an intravenous infusion of regular insulin has to be initiated to maintain the blood glucose level between 150 to 200 mg/dl and until the high anion-gap acidosis is resolved in DKA. Like mentioned above, potassium levels are usually high because of the transcellular shifts due to the acidosis and the lack of insulin.

Virtually nothing is known about the effects of transplacentally administered digoxin on the fetus. Toxicity has been reported in the fetus of a woman ingesting a huge overdose of digitoxin; the same result would be anticipated with digoxin poisoning. Serum levels in pregnant women receiving the standard dose of 0.25 mg tend to be subnormal and certain patients may require a small increase in dose during the last trimester. While the full-term neonate appears to tolerate relatively high doses and the resultant high serum levels, there is no compelling evidence that such doses are necessary or even useful. Since toxicity can and does occur in neonates, especially during administration of loading (digitalizing) doses, it is recommended that maintenance doses of 0.01 mg per kg per day be used routinely. If the full inotropic effect is needed immediately, a loading dose of 0.03 mg per kg may be employed. Maintenance therapy is then begun on the following day. Without a loading dose cumulation occurs for about 3 days; after 5 or so days, serum levels will equal those found after use of a loading dose followed by maintenance therapy. Results of a single study suggest that the daily dose should be divided and given every 12 hours. After about 1 week of therapy, the serum level should be determined and the dose modified to maintain a serum level of 1 to 2 ng per ml. If the therapeutic effect is less than desired, a cautions increase in dose to as high as 0.02 mg per kg per day or to that dose which produces serum levels up to 3 ng per ml can be tried.

There are no data which indicate that a greater inotropic response will occur at these high serum levels, though this point has not been definitively investigated, and is the highest priority question for research. The intramuscular route should be researved for the unusual situation. Vomiting should be considered an early sign of toxicity and may act as a \"safety valve.\" When adminstered in solution (as in the elixir or solution for intravenous use), oral digoxin is rapidly absorbed an an inotropic response is found within minutes, reaching a peak within hours, so that little is gained by parenteral administration.

Certain infants appear to tolerate serum levels of 3.5 to 4 ng per ml but such infants must be closely monitored. There are no data which indicate that a greater inotropic response will occur at these high serum levels, though this point has not been definitively investigated, and is the highest priority question for research. The intramuscular route should be researved for the unusual situation. Vomiting should be considered an early sign of toxicity and may act as a \"safety valve.\" When adminstered in solution (as in the elixir or solution for intravenous use), oral digoxin is rapidly absorbed an an inotropic response is found within minutes, reaching a peak within hours, so that little is gained by parenteral administration. If an inotropic effect is urgently needed, intravenous administration of ouabain will give an immediate response.",

        "content": "The classic presentation of DKA, consisting of hyperglycemia, anion gap acidosis, and ketonuria, is readily recognized. The diagnosis may be missed, however, in the patient who is euglycemic, has a negative nitroprusside test for ketones, or has a nonanion gap metabolic acidosis. Treatment includes replacement of fluid and electrolytes lost through osmotic diuresis. Failure to recognize the magnitude of total-body potassium depletion and to begin replacement despite an initially normal serum potassium level may lead to fatal cardiac arrhythmia. Serum glucose must be monitored closely to avoid hypoglycemia; dextrose should be added to the infusion once the serum glucose falls to 250 mg per dl. Insulin is required to reverse ketoacid production by the liver; low-dose therapy is recommended. Ketogenesis may be reversed inadequately unless insulin treatment is continued until the anion gap has normalized. Failure to recognize precipitating causes may result in increased morbidity and mortality from underlying infection or myocardial infarction as well as rapid relapse of ketoacidosis.",

        "content": "Treatment to address an ibuprofen overdose is based on how the symptoms present. In cases presenting early, decontamination of the stomach is recommended. This is achieved using activated charcoal; charcoal adsorbs the drug before it can enter the bloodstream. Gastric lavage is now rarely used, but can be considered if the amount ingested is potentially life-threatening, and it can be performed within 60 minutes of ingestion. Purposeful vomiting is not recommended. The majority of ibuprofen ingestions produce only mild effects, and the management of overdose is straightforward. Standard measures to maintain normal urine output should be instituted and kidney function monitored. Since ibuprofen has acidic properties and is also excreted in the urine, forced alkaline diuresis is theoretically beneficial. However, because ibuprofen is highly protein-bound in the blood, the kidneys' excretion of unchanged drug is minimal. Forced alkaline diuresis is, therefore, of limited benefit.",

        "content": "Toxicity All parts of these plants are known to be poisonous, containing dauricine and related isoquinoline alkaloids, and children have died from eating the fruits. Dauricine inhibits cardiac K+ channels thus causing arrhythmia. Other symptoms caused by consumption of the grape-like fruits include excitation of the CNS, leading to seizures and neuromuscular arrest. First aid in cases of Menispermum poisoning involves the induction of vomiting, followed by the administration of medicinal charcoal and sodium sulphate. Clinical therapy : gastric lavage ( possibly with 0.1% potassium permanganate ) instillation of medicinal charcoal and sodium sulphate; electrolyte substitution, control of acidosis with sodium bicarbonate ( pH of urine 7.5 ). In case of spasms, intravenous administration of diazepam. Provision of intubation and oxygen respiration in case of respiratory arrest or paralysis. Checking of diuresis and kidney function.",
