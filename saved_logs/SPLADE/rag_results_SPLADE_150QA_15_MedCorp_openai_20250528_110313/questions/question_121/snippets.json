        "content": "Osmosis, Greek for push, is the net movement of water across a semipermeable membrane (see Figure. Osmosis). [1] [2] Across this membrane, water tends to move from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration. It is important to\u00a0emphasize that ideal osmosis requires only the movement of pure water across the membrane without any movement of solute particles across the semipermeable membrane. Osmosis can still occur with some permeability of solute particles, but the osmotic effect becomes reduced with greater solute permeability across the semipermeable membrane. It is also true that, at a specific moment, water molecules can move towards either the higher or lower concentration solutions, but the net movement of water is towards the higher solute concentration.\u00a0The compartment with the highest solute and lowest water concentration has the greatest osmotic pressure.\u00a0Osmotic pressure can be calculated using the Van 't Hoff equation, which states that osmotic pressure depends on the number of solute particles, temperature, and how well a solute particle can move across a membrane. Its measured osmolality can describe the osmotic pressure of a solution. The osmolality of a solution describes how many particles are dissolved in the solution. The reflection coefficient of a semipermeable membrane describes how well solutes permeate the membrane. This coefficient ranges from 0 to 1. A reflection coefficient of 1 means a solute is impermeable. A reflection coefficient of 0 means a solute can be freely permeable, and the solute cannot generate osmotic pressure across the membrane. [2] The compartment with the greatest osmotic pressure pulls water in and tends to equalize the solute concentration difference between the compartments. The physical driving force of osmosis\u00a0is the increase in entropy generated by\u00a0the movement of free water molecules. It is also thought that the interaction of solute particles with membrane pores\u00a0generates a negative pressure, which is the osmotic pressure driving the water flow. [3] Reverse osmosis occurs when water is forced to flow in the opposite direction. In reverse osmosis, water flows into the compartment with lower osmotic pressure and higher water concentration. This flow is only possible by applying an external force to the system. Reverse osmosis is commonly used to purify drinking water and requires energy input. [4] The concept of osmosis should not be confused with diffusion. Diffusion is the net movement of particles from an area of high to low concentration. One can think of osmosis as a specific type of diffusion.\u00a0Both osmosis and diffusion are passive processes and involve the movement of particles from an area of high to low concentration.

The apparent steady-state fluxes over the time range of the test, obtained separately for physostigmine and its corresponding salicylate, indicate a consistent trend toward higher values for the salicylate in the series tested. The ratios of salicylate fluxes to physostigmine fluxes ranged from 1.1 to 3.34, the higher ratios being obtained at a volume fraction of IPA exceeding 0.7.

        "content": "Diffusion is the process by which molecules move spontaneously from an area of high concentration to one of low concentration. Thus wherever a concentration gradient exists, diffusion of molecules from the region of high concentration to the region of low concentration dissipates the gradient (as discussed later, the establishment of concentration gradients for molecules requires the expenditure of energy). Diffusion is a random process driven by the thermal motion of the molecules. Fick\u2019s first law of diffusion quantifies the rate at which a molecule diffuses from point A to point B: Equation 1.1 where J = the flux or rate of diffusion per unit time D = the diffusion coefficient A = area across which the diffusion is occurring \u0394C = the concentration difference between point A and B \u0394X = the distance along which diffusion is occurring",

        "title": "Solvent interaction with polydimethylsiloxane membranes and its effects on benzocaine solubility and diffusion.",
        "content": "The effect of polar solvents and polar cosolvent mixtures on the transport properties of benzocaine in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) was studied. Methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, and n-butanol, as well as aqueous cosolvent mixtures of each n-alkanol, were used as vehicles for benzocaine. A constant activity gradient was maintained in all diffusion studies, with the membrane exposed to saturated donor suspensions of drug, and sink conditions maintained in the receiver. In spite of the constant activity gradient, steady-state benzocaine flux was substantially enhanced with increasing n-alkanol volume fraction and reached a maximum for the pure n-alkanol in each case. At any given composition, the degree of benzocaine flux enhancement generally increased with n-alkanol carbon number. In terms of the appropriate Fick's first law expression for this system, these observations were attributed to simultaneous changes in benzocaine concentration within the PDMS membrane, the diffusion coefficient of benzocaine in PDMS, fillerless membrane volume fraction, tortuosity, and the membrane thickness. These parameters were in turn correlated with the cosolvent composition in contact with the membrane. Both membrane solubility and diffusion coefficient were found to increase substantially, but decreases in tortuosity and increases in fillerless membrane volume fraction and membrane thickness were minor.",
