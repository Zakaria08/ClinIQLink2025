A 20-item questionnaire was developed and sent to those individuals who successfully obtained fellowship positions through the 1991-1992 Match. All of the respondents will have completed a formal pediatric residency program, and 90% will have completed their residency since 1990. Eighty-eight percent of the respondents have not completed formal postgraduate training other than a pediatric residency, and none of the respondents were from training programs in emergency medicine. Ninety percent of the respondents are planning on two years of training, while 10% are either entering a three-year program or planning an optional third year. Ninety-four percent of the individuals who responded had not applied for Pediatric Emergency Medicine Fellowships in the past, but, while many of the individuals were concerned about obtaining a position, only 6% applied for a fellowship in an alternative field. If the respondents had not obtained positions this year, 79% felt that they would have reapplied next year. When asked why they are pursuing a Pediatric Emergency Medicine Fellowship, 85% listed opportunities in clinical medicine as their primary reason, while 10% claimed that research opportunity was the most important factor. When their fellowships are completed, 77% hope to practice at a university-based children's hospital, and 10% hope to practice at a private children's hospital.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

A 22-item questionnaire was administered to residents in conjunction with the yearly American Board of Emergency Medicine inservice examination. Demographic information and factors influencing career intent were elicited. Respondents were classified by intent on a career in emergency medicine. A three-way analysis of variance was used to address group differences for eight specific factors impacting on career decision. Chi-square analysis was used to address questions involving relationships among variables with dichotomous or categorical responses. The survey was distributed to 1,654 residents, and 1,238 (75%) completed the questionnaire. Motivating factors demonstrating significant differences between those residents planning an academic career and those not interested in academe were a desire to do research, desire to teach, desire to make a contribution to medicine, and exposure to role models, with less emphasis on the need for free time for other interests and less concern regarding practice location. More than 80% of those not going into academic emergency medicine believed they were adequately exposed to research in residency compared with 65% of those intent on a career in academe (P less than .01). Research in medical school, residency, and authorship of a research paper were significantly more prevalent for those residents desiring a career in academe (P less than .01). Twenty-six percent of residents responded that their role models for research were less than adequate. Seventeen percent of residents intend to take fellowship training. The most popular fields for fellowships were toxicology (25%), emergency medical services (21%), pediatrics (15%), and research (9%). The results of this survey address attitudes among residents toward a career in academic emergency medicine.
