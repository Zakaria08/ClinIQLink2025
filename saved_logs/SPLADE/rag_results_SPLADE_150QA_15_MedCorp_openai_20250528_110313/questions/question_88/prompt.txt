Document 1 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): developments in Excimer laser technology have led to increased optimism regarding the ability to safely deliver laser energy. Excimer laser atherectomy approved by the FDA for peripheral artery intervention employs precision laser energy control (shallow tissue penetration) and safer wavelengths (ultraviolet as opposed to the infrared spectra in older laser technology), which decrease perforation and thermal injury to the treated vessels.A laser atherectomy catheter, with diameters varying from 0.9 to 2.5 mm, is tracked over the guidewire to the desired tar-get. Once activated, the Excimer laser uses ultraviolet energy to ablate the lesion and create a nonthrombogenic arterial lumen. This lumen is further dilated by an angioplasty balloon. Because the Excimer laser can potentially reduce the rate of distal embo-lization by evaporating the lesion, it may be used as an adjunct tool for ostial lesions and lesions that can be traversed by a wire but not an angioplasty balloon
Document 2 (Title: Refractive surgery): Transepithelial photorefractive keratectomy (TransPRK) is a laser-assisted eye surgery to correct refraction errors of human eye cornea. It employs excimer laser to ablate outer layer of cornea, epithelium, as well its connective tissue, stroma, to correct eye optical power. Laser Assisted Sub-Epithelium Keratomileusis (LASEK) is a procedure that also changes the shape of the cornea using an excimer laser to ablate the tissue from the corneal stroma, under the corneal epithelium, which is kept mostly intact to act as a natural bandage. The surgeon uses an alcohol solution to loosen then lift a thin layer of the epithelium with a trephine blade (usually with a thickness of 50 micrometres). During the weeks following LASEK, the epithelium heals, leaving no permanent flap in the cornea. This healing process can involve discomfort comparable to that with PRK.
Document 3 (Title: Photorefractive Keratectomy -- Anatomy and Physiology): Laser refractive surgeries act upon the surface of the cornea, the transparent, dome-shaped, outermost layer that covers the front of the eye. The first step of PRK requires complete removal of the superficial corneal epithelium down to Bowman’s layer. The excimer laser then ablates the stroma, thereby remodeling the corneal surface. Further information regarding the excimer laser follows below. Following the procedure, re-epithelialization occurs via the migration of fibroblasts and collagen synthesis. [2]
Document 4 (Title: Ablation rate of human corneal epithelium and Bowman's layer with the excimer laser (193 nm).): Laser keratomileusis is a laser-specific procedure whereby a layer of corneal tissue as thin as 10 microns or more is removed from the anterior surface. In most cases, the laser ablates not only Bowman's layer but also portions of the anterior stroma. The histologic evaluation presented shows that the ablation behavior of these two layers is not uniform: at a fluence of 205 mJ/cm2 in Bowman's layer, the ablation rate was 0.38 +/- 0.05 microns per pulse, whereas in stroma it amounted to 0.55 +/- 0.1 microns per pulse. In epithelium, the ablation rate was 0.68 +/- 0.15 microns per pulse, but decreased with deeper excisions. We discuss the consequences of these different ablation rates on the procedure of laser keratomileusis.
Document 5 (Title: Myopia -- Treatment / Management -- Laser Refractive Correction or Laser Vision Correction): Flapless surgery is termed photorefractive keratectomy (PRK). The cornea is de-epithelialized using 20% alcohol or excimer lasers. Photoablation is performed over the Bowman membrane, followed by the application of 0.02% mitomycin-C for 30 s to prevent postsurgical corneal haze. After the procedure, a contact lens is placed to facilitate the growth of the corneal epithelium. Once epithelialization is complete, the contact lens is removed. PRK is considered the most favorable technique for maintaining the biomechanical integrity of the cornea. [56]
Document 6 (Title: [Wound healing of the cornea of New World monkeys after surface keratectomy: Er:YAG-excimer laser].): Corneal wound healing was studied after photoablation with an excimer laser (193 nm, 43 pulses at 180 mJ/cm2 [symbol: see text] 11 microns ablation depth, optical zone 2.0 mm) and with an erbium-YAG laser (2.94 microns, 5 pulses at 2.5 J/cm2 [symbol: see text] 50 microns ablation depth, optical zone 1.6 mm). The corneas of marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) were prepared 5 and 10 days and 4 and 25 weeks after photoablation. The sections were investigated by conventional light microscopy or exposed to antibodies against collagen types I, III, IV, VII and laminin and stained by indirect immunofluorescence. Macroscopically, the time-course of wound healing was comparable to that seen, after laser keratomileusis for correction of myopia in humans (epithelium closure after 24-48 h, subepithelial haze: erbium-YAG less than or equal to excimer). Histologically the time-course of wound healing could be schematically divided into three phases: (1) epithelial hyperplasia, inhomogeneous new synthesis of collagen fibrils subepithelially; (2) reorganization of the epithelium, hyperplasia of keratocytes, incipient reorganization of the collagen fibrils, increase in subepithelial haze; (3) reorganization of the collagen fibrils, decrease in subepithelial haze. The distribution of collagen type VII during the corneal wound healing suggests that the subepithelial haze observed during the healing process after laser keratomileusis for correction of myopia is based on the anchoring fibrils of the basement membrane.
Document 7 (Title: Photorefractive keratectomy): Photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) and laser-assisted sub-epithelial keratectomy (or laser epithelial keratomileusis) (LASEK) are laser eye surgery procedures intended to correct a person's vision, reducing dependency on glasses or contact lenses. LASEK and PRK permanently change the shape of the anterior central cornea using an excimer laser to ablate (remove by vaporization) a small amount of tissue from the corneal stroma at the front of the eye, just under the corneal epithelium. The outer layer of the cornea is removed prior to the ablation. A computer system tracks the patient's eye position 60 to 4,000 times per second, depending on the specifications of the laser that is used. The computer system redirects laser pulses for precise laser placement. Most modern lasers will automatically center on the patient's visual axis and will pause if the eye moves out of range and then resume ablating at that point after the patient's eye is re-centered.
Document 8 (Title: Laser In Situ Keratomileusis (LASIK) -- Anatomy and Physiology): LASIK surgery changes the refractive power of the cornea first by creating a hinged corneal flap from the epithelium, Bowman’s membrane, and the superficial part of the corneal stroma. The more posterior layers of the stroma are exposed for ablation treatment. Thus, for a myopic treatment, central corneal curvature is decreased with the ablation, and the total refractive power of the eye decreases to attain emmetropia, or normal vision (see figure 1). For a hyperopic treatment, the paracentral area is flattened, leading to a steeper central cornea and an increase in refractive power (see figure 1). After targeted laser therapy to the stroma, the flap is replaced, and reepithelialization occurs over the flap margin. Sutures are not necessary.
Document 9 (Title: Wound healing after excimer laser keratomileusis (photorefractive keratectomy) in monkeys.): Laser myopic keratomileusis (photorefractive keratectomy) was performed on 29 rhesus monkey corneas with an argon fluoride (193-nm) excimer laser and a computer-controlled, moving slit delivery system. The 4-mm-diameter central ablation zone ranged in depth from 11 microns (-2 diopters effect) to 46 microns (-8 diopters effect). Corneas were studied for the 9 months postoperatively by clinical slit-lamp microscopy, and periodically with light and transmission electron microscopy. By 6 weeks, mild to moderate subepithelial haze was apparent in 93% of the corneas, with considerable variability in density. Progressive clearing occurred so that by 6 to 9 months 12 of 13 surviving corneas (92%) were either completely clear (4 corneas) or trace hazy (8 corneas). The epithelium was thickened at 21 days after ablation and returned to normal thickness by 3 months. At 3 weeks, subepithelial fibroblasts were three times the density of normal keratocytes and returned to nearly normal numbers by 9 months. We concluded that the anterior monkey cornea demonstrated a mild, typical wound healing response after excimer laser keratomileusis.
Document 10 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): was necessary in only 6.3% of lesions. Results from the TALON registry support the role of plaque excision in selected patients with lower extremity arterial disease.Recent technologic advances have made it possible to increase the spectrum of treatable peripheral arterial lesions with high acute procedure success rates. Recently presented data from multiple registries have shown some promising results in terms of short-term primary patency rates and freedom from unplanned major amputation.169 Randomized clinical trials, which may provide conclusions on the effectiveness of these procedures, are expected.Laser Atherectomy. Since laser atherectomy was reported in the 1960s, a variety of innovative approaches have been devel-oped trying to overcome the limitation of laser angioplasty. Recent developments in Excimer laser technology have led to increased optimism regarding the ability to safely deliver laser energy. Excimer laser atherectomy approved by the FDA for peripheral artery
Document 11 (Title: Far-sightedness): Laser procedures Photorefractive keratectomy (PRK): This is a refractive technique that is done by removal of a minimal amount of the corneal surface. Hyperopic PRK has many complications like regression effect, astigmatism due to epithelial healing, and corneal haze. Post operative epithelial healing time is also more for PRK. Laser assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK): Laser eye surgery to reshape the cornea, so that glasses or contact lenses are no longer needed. Excimer laser LASIK can correct hypermetropia up to +6 diopters. LASIK is contraindicated in patients with lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. Laser epithelial keratomileusis (LASEK): Resembles PRK, but uses alcohol to loosen the corneal surface. Epi-LASIK: Epi-LASIK is also used to correct hyperopia. In this procedure, use of epikeratome eliminates the use of alcohol.
Document 12 (Title: Clinicopathologic study of healing excimer laser radial excisions.): Four radial linear excisions were created by an argon fluoride (193 nm) excimer laser in the edematous cornea of a blind eye of a diabetic human patient. Partial thickness corneal trephinations were performed at 3, 7, and 18 months after surgery for histopathologic examination. At 3 months, a wide gap in Bowman's layer permitted extension of an epithelial plug to a depth of 0.35 mm; at 7 and 18 months, the depth of the epithelial plug was decreased to 0.29 mm and 0.01 mm, respectively. With wound healing, excision width decreased and the two cut ends of Bowman's layer were almost reapposed by 18 months, suggesting wound contraction. Linear excisions with the excimer laser appear to be wider than incisions made with a diamond blade, but the pattern of wound maturation appears to be similar.
Document 13 (Title: Myopia -- Treatment / Management -- Laser Refractive Correction or Laser Vision Correction): Lasers can be delivered to the cornea with or without flap creation. Flap surgeries are termed laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK), wherein a microkeratome or femtosecond laser is used to create a corneal flap with thicknesses ranging from 90 to 160 µm. [55] [56] Next, the flap is elevated, and depending on the amount of refractive error, photoablation of the corneal stroma is performed using excimer lasers; the minimum residual stromal bed is maintained at 250 µm. After ablation, the flap is placed over the bed, and the procedure is completed. See Image . Steps of LASIK Eye Surgery.
Document 14 (Title: Histology_Ross): overexpressed during the wound-healing process following corneal injury. Normally, the cornea contains no blood vessels or pigments. During an infammatory response involving the cornea, large numbers of neutrophilic leukocytes and lymphocytes migrate from blood vessels of the corneoscleral limbus and penetrate the stromal lamellae. Descemet’s membrane is an unusually thick basal lamina. Descemet’s membrane (posterior basement membrane) is the basal lamina of corneal endothelial cells. It is intensely positive to periodic acid–Schiff (PAS) and can be as thick as 10 m. Descemet’s membrane has a feltlike appearance and consists of an interwoven meshwork of fibers and pores. It separates the corneal endothelium from the adjacent corneal stroma. Unlike Bowman’s membrane, Descemet’s membrane readily regenerates after injury. It is produced continuously but slowly thickens with age.
Document 15 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): interleukin-6 (IL-6).123There are two major strategies for adhesion prevention or reduction. Surgical trauma is minimized within the peritoneum by careful tissue handling, avoiding desiccation and ischemia, and spare use of cautery, laser, and retractors. Fewer adhesions form with laparoscopic surgical techniques due to reduced tis-sue trauma. The second major advance in adhesion prevention has been the introduction of barrier membranes and gels, which separate and create barriers between damaged mesothelial sur-faces, allowing for adhesion-free healing. Currently, only three products are Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for reducing adhesion formation: Interceed (oxidized regen-erated cellulose, indicated only in pelvic surgery), Seprafilm (a film composed of hyaluronic acid and carboxymethylcel-lulose) that is usually applied below the incision, and Adept (4% icodextrin, a corn starch derivative in electrolyte solution, also for use mainly in pelvic surgery). However,
