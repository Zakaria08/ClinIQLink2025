The results provide the following information: (1) CNS structures other than the basal forebrain are sensitive to NGF during early development. (2) Both normal and hypothyroid rats are more sensitive to NGF deprivation than NGF supplementation. (3) The effects of anti-NGF antibodies in normal rats are similar to those induced by anti-NGFr antibodies. (4) NGF alone had little or no effect, but interacts with T4 in promoting cell maturation, especially in hypothyroid rats. (5) Hypothyroid rats are more sensitive to T4 and to T4 plus NGF than are normal ones. (6) The synergistic action of both trophic factors, but not that of T4, tend to disappear at long term in hypothyroid rats. (7) The differential sensitivity of the brain areas to T4, NGF, or both trophic factors correlates with their cell acquisition rate, especially in hypothyroid rats. (8) T4 and NGF together act more markedly (but not exclusively) on the cholinergic structures in both normal and hypothyroid rats. (9) RNA appears to be very sensitive to NGF, especially in hypothyroid rats. In close correlation with preliminary morphological observations, the results clearly demonstrate that an interaction between T4 and NGF regulates the ontogeny of a number of neuronal structures in CNS independently of their neurotransmitter phenotype, but with a regional specificity. The possibilities of accounting for this interaction, in particular the major role of thyroxine, are discussed.",

Control groups received the same diet with iodine-supplemented drinking water. The measurements included: thyroid total 127I concentration, thyroid weight, [131i] mit/[131i]dit and [131i]t3/[131i]t4 after a labeling period of 18--24 h, serum T4, serum T3, and serum TSH. In the acute experiments serum T4 was significantly decreased at 6--7 days. Thereafter, the decrease was rapid and progressive, and by 26 days serum T4 was reduced to undetectable levels (less than .05 mug per 100 ml). Thyroid T4 decreased more rapidly than serum T4, suggesting that the turnover rate of thyroid T4 increased soon after the onset of LID. Serum T3, in contrast to serum T4 showed no significant change during the 26 day period. Thyroid T3 decreased less rapidly than thyroid T4, but was greatly reduced by 26 days. Presumably the turnover rate of thyroih was slightly but significantly elevated at 4 days, before there was any detectable decrease in serum T4. Thereafter, the results were somewhat variable, but there appeared to be no significant further rise in serum TSH up to about day 15, despite the observation that serum T4 fell rapidly during this period. Only after 15 days did serum TSH display a sharp increase. It is apparent from these results that there is no simple inverse relationship between plasma T4 and plasma TSH. In the chronic experiments serum T4 remained undetectable. Serum T3 was decreased to about 50% of the normal level at 7 weeks but there appeared to be no further decrease even at 55 weeks. Serum TSH rose to very high levels at 12 weeks but showed no further increase thereafter. Thyroid 127I concentration reached its lowest value at 15 weeks and showed no further decrease. Thyroid weight, on the other hand, appeared to increase progressively. To evaluate the effect of severe iodine deficiency on thyroid status, rats that had been on LID for 3-4 months were exposed to a cold environment (4--5 C). Body temperature and survival rates were compared with those of matched controls receiving LID + KI drinking water. The body temperatures of the latter group increased significantly on exposure to cold, and all animals survived. On the other hand, the body temperature of rats on LID alone began to decrease about 5 days after the onset of cold exposure, and when the diet was sufficiently low in iodine the majority of the rats died within 15 days. These results suggest that thyroid function in severely iodine deficient rats is not adequate to meet the challenge of acute cold stress. In this sense, therefore, these animals may be daid to display signs of hypothyroidism.",

        "content": "Naturally occurring and synthetic flavonoids are potent inhibitors of thyroid hormone 5'-deiodination and binding to human serum transthyretin (TTR) in vitro. We now describe the inhibitory effect of the most potent flavonoid, 3-methyl-4',6-dihydroxy-3',5'-dibromo-flavone (EMD 21388), on the serum protein binding of T4 and T3 and subsequent alterations of pituitary-thyroid function in the rat. Eight to 10 mumol/liter EMD 21388 added to pooled rat serum completely displaced [125I]T4 or [125I]T3 binding from TTR, the major thyroid hormone-binding protein in the rat, and markedly increased the percentages of free T4 and T3, measured by equilibrium dialysis. One to 4 h after the ip administration of 2 mumol EMD 21388/100 g BW to euthyroid rats, [125I]T4 and [125I]T3 binding to TTR decreased, serum T4 and T3 concentrations decreased, and the percentages of free T4 and free T3 increased. No changes were observed in the free T4 and free T3 concentrations. Serum TSH concentrations decreased at 1 h and were very low thereafter. EMD 21388 administration did not affect the elevated serum TSH concentrations in hypothyroid rats, strongly suggesting that the flavonoid does not directly affect TSH secretion. No changes were observed in hepatic type I 5'-deiodinase in euthyroid rats and pituitary type I and type II 5'-deiodinase in euthyroid and hypothyroid rats after EMD 21388 administration. We conclude that the ip administration of EMD 21388 to euthyroid rats inhibits T4 and T3 binding to TTR, with subsequent increases in the percentages of free T4 and free T3 and decreased serum T4 and T3 concentrations. The decrease in the serum TSH concentration was possibly due to transcient increases in the serum free T4 and/or free T3 concentrations, resulting in increased pituitary thyroid hormone content.",

        "content": "The first repeat thyroid function test (TFT), which includes free T4 and TSH, is to be drawn at 1\u00a0to 2 weeks after the start of L-T4 therapy with follow-up TFT\u00a0every two weeks until a complete normalization of TSH. Repeat TFT is recommended every 1\u00a0to 3 months until 1 year of age. Children should have follow-up visits with TFT obtained every 2\u00a0to 4 months between the ages of 1\u00a0to 3 years, and every 3-12 months until growth is completed. More frequent visits and laboratory evaluations may be scheduled for patients with poor adherence or abnormal levels. Any L-T4 dose adjustment or formulation change requires a repeat TFT in 4-6 weeks. The goal of therapy is to maintain the total T4 in the upper half of the age-specific reference range and TSH level within the age-specific reference range. [14]",

        "content": "Thyroid hormones Total thyroxine Total thyroxine is rarely measured, having been largely superseded by free thyroxine tests. Total thyroxine (Total T4) is generally elevated in hyperthyroidism and decreased in hypothyroidism. It is usually slightly elevated in pregnancy secondary to increased levels of thyroid binding globulin (TBG). Total T4 is measured to see the bound and unbound levels of T4. The total T4 is less useful in cases where there could be protein abnormalities. The total T4 is less accurate due to the large amount of T4 that is bound. The total T3 is measured in clinical practice since the T3 has decreased amount that is bound as compared to T4. Reference ranges depend on the method of analysis. Results should always be interpreted using the range from the laboratory that performed the test. Example values are: Free thyroxine Free thyroxine (fT4 or free T4) is generally elevated in hyperthyroidism and decreased in hypothyroidism.",
