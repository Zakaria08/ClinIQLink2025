Document 1 (Title: Community-acquired pneumonia): Hospitalization Some CAP patients require intensive care, with clinical prediction rules such as the pneumonia severity index and CURB-65 guiding the decision whether or not to hospitalize. Factors increasing the need for hospitalization include: Age greater than 65 Underlying chronic illnesses Respiratory rate greater than 30 per minute Systolic blood pressure less than 90 mmHg Heart rate greater than 125 per minute Temperature below 35 or over 40 °C Confusion Evidence of infection outside the lung Laboratory results indicating hospitalization include: Arterial oxygen tension less than 60 mm Hg Carbon dioxide over 50 mmHg or pH under 7.35 while breathing room air Hematocrit under 30 percent Creatinine over 1.2 mg/dl or blood urea nitrogen over 20 mg/dl White-blood-cell count under 4 × 10^9/L or over 30 × 10^9/L Neutrophil count under 1 x 10^9/L
Document 2 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): A 45-year-old man is brought to the local hospital emer-gency department by ambulance. His wife reports that he had been in his normal state of health until 3 days ago when he developed a fever and a productive cough. Dur-ing the last 24 hours he has complained of a headache and is increasingly confused. His wife reports that his medical history is significant only for hypertension, for which he takes hydrochlorothiazide and lisinopril, and that he is allergic to amoxicillin. She says that he developed a rash many years ago when prescribed amoxicillin for bron-chitis. In the emergency department, the man is febrile (38.7°C [101.7°F]), hypotensive (90/54 mmHg), tachypneic (36/min), and tachycardic (110/min). He has no signs of meningismus but is oriented only to person. A stat chest x-ray shows a left lower lung consolidation consistent with pneumonia. A CT scan is not concerning for lesions or elevated intracranial pressure. The plan is to start empiric antibiotics and perform a
Document 3 (Title: [Klebsiella pneumoniae meningitis associated with liver abscess: a case report].): We report a rare case of Klebsiella pneumoniae meningitis associated with liver abscess, which was successfully treated with cefotaxime (CTX), one of the third-generation cephalosporins. A 53-year-old man was admitted to Keio University Hospital on June 13, 1988, because of a fever and a headache. On June 3, he suddenly started shivering and his temperature rose to 39 degrees C. He then began to complain of polydipsia, polyuria, and a weight loss of 4 kg a week. On June 11, he developed a severe headache. Four years prior to this incident, he had been diagnosed as having diabetes after a routine medical examination, but had neglected to undergo medical treatment. On admission, laboratory data showed leukocytosis, hyperglycemia (394 mg/dl) and ketonuria (4+). A lumbar puncture yielded cloudy cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) containing 500/3 cells/mm8, of which about 70% were neutrophils. A diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis and purulent meningitis was made. A treatment with ampicillin (ABPC) and CTX, (12 g/day, each) was begun. On the third day, cultures of a blood specimen and CSF yielded both K. pneumoniae. The MICs of CTX to K. pneumoniae isolated from blood and CSF were both 0.05 microgram/ml. ABPC was discontinued, gentamicin was administered for 2 days, CTX was continued at the same dosage level and an administration of prednisolone 40 mg daily was begun.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Document 4 (Title: 38-Year-Old Male Presents With Lower Extremity Edema -- Case Presentation): His physical exam revealed clear lungs and a normal heart exam on auscultation. His abdomen was soft and non-tender, and his skin was warm and dry with no rash. He had 2 plus pitting edema at the ankles. Initial laboratory data was consistent with acute kidney injury (AKI) with worsening creatinine from 1.2 to 1.6 over 1 month and nephrotic range proteinuria. Serologies for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, anti-nuclear antibody (ANA), c-ANCA, serine protease 3 (PR3) IgG, myeloperoxidase antibody (MPO), and complement levels were sent. He was started on losartan for proteinuria with plans for renal biopsy; however, he was lost to follow up. The patient then presented two weeks later with worsening edema to his waist, continued weight gain, mild hemoptysis, and streaks of blood in the stool. Physical examination now showed worsening pitting edema up to his waist with new non-pruritic, erythematous excoriations on the medial aspect of his thighs bilaterally. He was admitted to the hospital with concern for worsening vasculitis. He was started on oral prednisone and underwent a renal biopsy. For his edema, he was started on diuretics to which he responded well. Due to persistent leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing was performed to complete the workup.

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
Question: A 4-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department by his parents. He is lethargic and confused and has a severe headache, vomiting, and a high-grade fever since earlier that day. His mother reports that the child was doing well until 2 days ago when he developed a fever and green nasal discharge. The patient has a history of neonatal sepsis, meningococcemia at 18 months of age, and pneumococcal pneumonia at 2 and 3 years of age. His scheduled vaccinations are up to date. His blood pressure is 70/50 mm Hg, heart rate is 120/min, respiratory rate is 22/min, and temperature is 39.3°C (102.4°F). On examination, the child is lethargic and his skin is pale, with several petechiae over his buttocks. There is a purulent nasal discharge from both nostrils. The lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Heart sounds are normal. There is marked neck rigidity. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows the following results: Opening pressure 100 mm H2O Appearance cloudy Protein 500 mg/dL (5 g/L) White blood cells 2500/μL (polymorphonuclear predominance) Protein 450 mg/dL (4.5 g/L) Glucose 31 mg/dL (1.7 mmol/L) Culture positive for N. meningitidis Which of the following immunological processes is most likely to be impaired in this child?
Options:
A. Production of IL-2 by Th1 cells
B. Activation of TCRs by MHC-II
C. Formation of C5-9 complex
D. Cleavage of C2 component of complement into C2a and C2b
