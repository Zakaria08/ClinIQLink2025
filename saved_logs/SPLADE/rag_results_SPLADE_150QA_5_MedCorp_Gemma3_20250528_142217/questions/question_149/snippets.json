These tests help detect increases in serum creatinine and the presence of proteinuria, which is commonly observed in lupus nephritis. Given the high risk of increased morbidity, timely treatment is crucial to prevent progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD).

        "content": "Clinical and pathological analysis were performed on 127 cases of deep mycoses diagnosed by autopsy during the 24 years between 1964 and 1987 in Juntendo University Hospital. The following findings were obtained. 1) There has been a tendency for the number of mycoses to increase each year, especially notable for candidiasis and aspergillosis. 2) Underlying diseases were, in order of incidence, various hematologic diseases, solid tumors, inflammatory diseases and collagen diseases; the most common were various types of leukemia. 3) Candidiasis was often observed in patients with gastrointestinal tract cancers. Aspergillosis was often observed in patients with collagen diseases. 4) Regarding the visceral distribution of mycoses, aspergillosis was observed in the lung, candidiasis was observed in the lung, kidney and intestinal tract in decreasing order, and cryptococcosis was also observed in the lung and central nervous system. 5) There was a probability of fungal infections occurring in cases of lymphopenia. 6) A fever was present at the time of hospitalization in many cases of aspergillosis, and the presence of an indwelling catheter was a common feature in cases of candidiasis. 7) Fungemia was frequently observed in candidiasis, but very rarely in cases of aspergillosis. 8) The large amounts of corticosteroid hormones and blood transfusions were suspected as causative factors of fungal infections.",

        "content": "In order to identify appropriate treatment options for postpneumonic empyema, we reviewed the medical records and, when possible, obtained long-term follow-up chest radiographs and pulmonary function tests on children treated for empyema during the past 11 years. Fifty-one patients were treated in various ways, with antibiotics alone (N = 10), or in combination with tube thoracostomy (N = 23) or decortication (N = 18). Despite administration of appropriate antibiotics and establishment of pleural drainage, many children required prolonged hospitalization and eventual decortication. Based on this review, a scoring system was developed allowing early classification by severity of pleural disease. Factors found to be predictors of severe pleural disease include (1) low pleural fluid pH or (2) glucose; (3) presence of moderate or severe scoliosis or (4) pleural peel or parenchymal entrapment by chest radiography; and (5) infection due to anaerobes, gram-negative organisms, or mycoplasma. Complete opacification of a hemithorax on chest radiography and a pleural peel to thoracic ratio greater than 40% were also associated with severe pleural disease. In patients with mild disease (N = 7), response to antibiotics alone, rapid resolution of fever, and shorter hospital stays were observed. In patients with more severe infections (moderate = 22, severe = 22), decortication accomplished earlier defervescence, radiographic improvement, and hospital discharge than simple tube thoracostomy. No deaths or morbidity were associated with decortication, which could often be accomplished through a minithoracotomy. Follow-up chest radiographs and pulmonary fuction tests showed a prompt return to normal after decortication. This experience indicates utility of a pleural disease severity scoring system in selection of treatment options for children with postpneumonic empyema.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
