For Friedman, legal culture \"refers to public knowledge of and attitudes and behaviour patterns toward the legal system\". It can also consist of \"bodies of custom organically related to the culture as a whole. Friedman stresses the plurality of legal cultures and points out that one can explore legal cultures at different levels of abstraction, e.g. at the level of the legal system, the state, the country, or the community. Friedman is also known for introducing the distinction between the \"internal\" and \"external\" legal cultures. Somewhat oversimplified, the former refers to the general attitudes and perceptions of law among the functionaries of the legal system, such as the judiciary, while the latter can refer to the attitude of the citizenry to the legal system or to law and order generally.",

        "content": "AIDS in the Republic of Ireland has so far mainly been associated with intravenous drug use. However, because of growing public pressure to mount an AIDS campaign aimed at potentially vulnerable sub-groups, we conducted a survey of knowledge and attitudes related to AIDS among 891 Irish schoolchildren in the senior years of secondary school. Although virtually none of the children had received any classroom education on AIDS and no national education programme had been undertaken at the time of the survey, levels of knowledge were high among the pupils studied, and compared favourably with levels found using the same questionnaire among San Franciscan pupils. Higher levels of knowledge were found among urban pupils and, although some sex differences in knowledge emerged, there was no consistent pattern in these. No school surveyed showed sufficient misinformation to warrant a systematic education programme.",

        "content": "In a study of relationships among knowledge, attitudes, and statements of nursing behavior about sexuality, degree of comfort with sexual situations was measured with a Professional Sexual Role Inventory (PSRI), using ridit analysis. The PSRI and the Sex Knowledge and Attitude Test were administered in groups to 107 professional family planning nurses and 64 senior nursing students. The major hypothesis--the more knowledge a nurse has of human sexuality, the more favorable will be her attitude toward it and the more comfortable she will be in professional situations with sexual overtones--was supported. Significant positive correlations between sexual knowledge and attitudes and written responses indicated comfort in handling sexual situations. Analyses of variance of the test scores--by age, race, marital status, religion, religiosity, frequency of church attendance, and urbanization--demonstrated areas of sexuality which might be incorporated into nursing inservice training and education.",
