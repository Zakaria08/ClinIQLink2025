Document 1 (Title: Sociology of law): Lawrence M. Friedman is among socio-legal scholars who introduced the idea of legal culture into the sociology of law. For Friedman, legal culture "refers to public knowledge of and attitudes and behaviour patterns toward the legal system". It can also consist of "bodies of custom organically related to the culture as a whole. Friedman stresses the plurality of legal cultures and points out that one can explore legal cultures at different levels of abstraction, e.g. at the level of the legal system, the state, the country, or the community. Friedman is also known for introducing the distinction between the "internal" and "external" legal cultures. Somewhat oversimplified, the former refers to the general attitudes and perceptions of law among the functionaries of the legal system, such as the judiciary, while the latter can refer to the attitude of the citizenry to the legal system or to law and order generally.
Document 2 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): The Bell Commission recom-mended that residents work no more than 80 hours per week and no more than 24 consecutive hours per shift, and that a senior physician needed to be physically present in the hospital at all times. These recommendations were adopted by New York State in 1989. In 2003, the Accreditation Council on Graduate Medi-cal Education followed by mandating that all residency training programs adhere to the reduced work hour schedule.understand and deliver safe patient care. In fact, culture (col-lective attitudes and beliefs of caregivers) is increasingly being recognized to be the fourth measurable component to the structure-process-outcome model. This recognition is based on growing evidence that local culture is linked to a variety of important clinical outcomes.10 For any new patient safety initiative to be deemed successful, any change in structure or process must lead to a corresponding positive change in patient outcomes.11CREATING A CULTURE OF SAFETYCulture is to
Document 3 (Title: Sexual Harassment and Prevention Training -- Issues of Concern -- Organizational Culture - Most Potent Predictor): Although individual behavioral changes can yield meaningful results, wholesale cultural transformation is key to preventing sexual harassment. The employer should design a culture based on mutual respect, inclusion, and dignity. Improving transparency and accountability, clearly communicating a code of conduct that forbids unacceptable behavior, outlining punitive repercussions, and promoting a zero-tolerance attitude help define an anti-harassment culture. [19] Senior faculty should be encouraged to intervene when they become aware of harassing conduct because they can be role models and positively impact those involved.
Document 4 (Title: What Irish schoolchildren know about AIDS.): AIDS in the Republic of Ireland has so far mainly been associated with intravenous drug use. However, because of growing public pressure to mount an AIDS campaign aimed at potentially vulnerable sub-groups, we conducted a survey of knowledge and attitudes related to AIDS among 891 Irish schoolchildren in the senior years of secondary school. Although virtually none of the children had received any classroom education on AIDS and no national education programme had been undertaken at the time of the survey, levels of knowledge were high among the pupils studied, and compared favourably with levels found using the same questionnaire among San Franciscan pupils. Higher levels of knowledge were found among urban pupils and, although some sex differences in knowledge emerged, there was no consistent pattern in these. No school surveyed showed sufficient misinformation to warrant a systematic education programme.
Document 5 (Title: Sexuality of nurses: correlations of knowledge, attitudes, and behavior.): In a study of relationships among knowledge, attitudes, and statements of nursing behavior about sexuality, degree of comfort with sexual situations was measured with a Professional Sexual Role Inventory (PSRI), using ridit analysis. The PSRI and the Sex Knowledge and Attitude Test were administered in groups to 107 professional family planning nurses and 64 senior nursing students. The major hypothesis--the more knowledge a nurse has of human sexuality, the more favorable will be her attitude toward it and the more comfortable she will be in professional situations with sexual overtones--was supported. Significant positive correlations between sexual knowledge and attitudes and written responses indicated comfort in handling sexual situations. Analyses of variance of the test scores--by age, race, marital status, religion, religiosity, frequency of church attendance, and urbanization--demonstrated areas of sexuality which might be incorporated into nursing inservice training and education.
