        "title": "A serum heterodimer from hagfish (Eptatretus stoutii) exhibits structural similarity and partial sequence identity with immunoglobulin.",
        "content": "We have isolated, characterized, and partially sequenced immunoglobulin from the most primitive extant nonvertebrate craniate, the hagfish, a jawless fish that may have diverged from the vertebrate lineage more than 500 million years ago. The 160-kDa protein, which is a minor serum component, is composed of two different heavy chains of 69 and 74 kDa and a light chain of 29 kDa and resembles known immunoglobulin on the basis of an equimolar ratio of heavy and light chains, N-linked glycosylation of heavy chains, presence of intra- and interchain disulfide bonds, and polydispersity of each peptide chain. High molecular mass (polymeric) as well as low molecular mass (monomeric) forms were isolated from serum. The hagfish immunoglobulin is unique in that each heterodimer is composed of two different heavy chains and two light chains. The partial peptide maps and amino acid compositions of the two heavy chains differ; the chains do not crossreact immunologically. Slight crossreactivity of the 74-kDa heavy chain with antisera against purified shark immunoglobulin and some conservation of amino acid sequences, including those surrounding a cysteine, suggest that the isolated protein is an immunoglobulin.",

        "title": "Biochemistry, Immunoglobulin M -- Molecular Level",
        "content": "Both light chain loci, the kappa and lambda loci, have approximately 30 V and 5 J segments that can be differentially recombined. Unlike the heavy chain loci, the light chain loci do not contain D segments. Light chain recombination in pre-B cells predominantly occurs initially on the kappa loci, and if a pre-B cell is unable to form an IgM immunoglobulin that is non-reactive to self-antigens in the bone marrow using the\u00a02 kappa loci, recombination of the lambda loci initiates. A non-self-reacting IgM molecule is produced at the surface, and other light chain loci recombination is inhibited if a functional light chain is produced. This process, called allelic exclusion, ensures that circulating B-2 lymphocytes produce immunoglobulins with a distinct antigen recognition site. Since the kappa light chains are attempted first in the recombination process, most antibodies, including IgM, contain kappa light chains.\u00a0Circulating mature yet naive follicular B cells express IgM and IgD as transmembrane antigen receptors. The mu and delta genes for the heavy chains of IgM and IgD, respectively, are located proximal to the VDJ encoding regions of the heavy chain locus, and alternate RNA processing of the primary RNA transcript produces both transmembrane IgM and IgD on naive B cells. A transmembrane immunoglobulin cannot transmit intracellular signals to the B cell in response to antigen binding. Therefore, transmembrane immunoglobulins are associated with Ig alpha and Ig beta proteins forming the BCR. The Ig alpha and Ig beta proteins contain the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation (ITAM) motifs required to stimulate naive B cell activation in response to transmembrane IgM or IgD antigen recognition. Initial naive B cell activation in response to antigen recognition results in IgM antibody secretion.",

        "title": "Immunoglobulin D",
        "content": "Immunoglobulin D (IgD) is an antibody isotype that makes up about 1% of proteins in the plasma membranes of immature B-lymphocytes where it is usually co-expressed with another cell surface antibody called IgM. IgD is also produced in a secreted form that is found in very small amounts in blood serum, representing 0.25% of immunoglobulins in serum. The relative molecular mass and half-life of secreted IgD is 185 kDa and 2.8 days, respectively. Secreted IgD is produced as a monomeric antibody with two heavy chains of the delta (\u03b4) class, and two Ig light chains. Function The function of IgD has been a puzzle in immunology since its discovery in 1964. IgD is present in species from cartilaginous fish to human (with the possible exception of birds). This nearly ubiquitous appearance in species with an adaptive immune system demonstrates that IgD may be as ancient as IgM and suggests that IgD has important immunological functions.",

        "content": "4-1 IgG antibodies consist of four polypeptide chains. IgG antibodies are large molecules with a molecular weight of approximately 150 kDa and are composed of two different kinds of polypeptide chains. One, of approximately 50 kDa, is called the heavy or H chain, and the other, of 25 kDa, is the light or L chain (Fig. 4.2). Each IgG molecule consists of two heavy chains and two light chains. The two heavy chains are linked to each other by disulfide bonds, and each heavy chain is linked to a light chain by a disulfide bond. In any given immunoglobulin molecule, the two heavy chains and the two light chains are identical, giving an antibody molecule two identical antigen-binding sites. This gives the antibody the ability to bind simultaneously to two identical antigens on a surface, thereby increasing the total strength of the interaction, which is called its avidity. The strength of the interaction between a single antigen-binding site and its antigen is called its affinity.",
