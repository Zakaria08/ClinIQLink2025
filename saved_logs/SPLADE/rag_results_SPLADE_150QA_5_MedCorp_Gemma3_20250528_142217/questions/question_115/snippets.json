        "title": "[Hemoperfusion with coated activated charcoal for treating acute poisoning by remedies, plant protectants, and fungi. I. Remedies (author's transl)].",
        "content": "Hemoperfusion with coated activated charcoal is a novel procedure for treating acute poisoning. It enables the elimination of both, water-soluble and liposoluble toxins. Hemoperfusion with coated activated charcoal has proved to be superior to hemodialysis in the treatment of barbiturate or bromocarbamide poisoning both under experimental conditions as well as in the ward. Analogous statements may be made for the therapy of glutethimide poisoning. Methaqualone, on the other hand, could not be eliminated sufficiently well in animal trials. Intoxications by \"mild\" analgetics, such as paracetamol and acetylsalicylic acid, may be treated successfully with hemoperfusion. Treatment of acetylsalicylic acid poisoning is equally effective with hemoperfusion as with hemodialysis. Prospects for the success of hemoperfusion in treating intoxication from tricyclic antidepressants and neuroliptics are slight. It is simply the danger of antidepressant poisoning that justifies using this method of treatment in the first few hours after ingestion in order to reduced the flow of the psychopharmaceutical substance into the tissue.",

Case studies involving pennyroyal poisonings have reported the use of gastric lavages and administration of emetics or vomiting inducing agents, or absorbents like activated charcoal. As glutathione depletion has been shown to regulate liver toxification, administration of N-acetylcysteine in similar doses as given for acetaminophen toxicity have been given to patients. A study testing pulegone toxicity found inhibitors of cytochrome P450, such as cobaltous chloride or piperonyl butoxide, blocked toxicity. Such testing has not been expanded to humans, however, as the pennyroyal mechanism of toxicity is still not entirely understood.

        "content": "Treatment includes gastric lavage, supportive measures, and oral administration of activated charcoal or cholestyramine to prevent absorption of residual drug. Neither charcoal nor cholestyramine appears to be effective if given >30 min after acetaminophen ingestion; if they are used, the stomach lavage should be done before other agents are administered orally. The chances of possible, probable, and high-risk hepatotoxicity can be derived from a nomogram plot (Fig. 361-2), readily available in emergency departments, as a function of measuring acetaminophen plasma levels 8 h after ingestion. In patients with high acetaminophen blood levels (>200 \u03bcg/mL measured at 4 h or >100 \u03bcg/mL at 8 h after ingestion), the administration of N-acetylcysteine reduces the severity of hepatic necrosis. This agent provides sulfhydryl donor groups to replete glutathione, which is required to render harmless toxic metabolites that would otherwise bind covalently via sulfhydryl linkages to cell proteins,",
