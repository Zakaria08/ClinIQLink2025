Document 1 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): ETs exert widespread actions in the body. In particular, they cause potent dose-dependent vasoconstriction in most vascular beds. Intravenous administration of ET-1 causes a rapid and transient decrease in arterial blood pressure followed by a sustained increase. The depressor response results from release of prostacyclin and nitric oxide from the vascular endothelium, whereas the pressor response is due to direct contraction of vascular smooth muscle. ETs also exert direct positive inotropic and chronotropic actions on the heart and are potent coronary vasoconstrictors. They act on the kidneys to cause vasoconstriction and decrease glomerular filtration rate and sodium and water excretion. In the respiratory system, they cause potent contraction of tracheal and bronchial smooth muscle. ETs interact with several endocrine systems, increasing the secretion of renin, aldosterone, AVP, and ANP. They exert a variety of actions on the central and peripheral nervous systems, the
Document 2 (Title: Angiotensin II receptor type 1): Angiotensin II receptor type 1 or AT1 receptor is the best characterized angiotensin receptor. It has vasopressor effects and regulates aldosterone secretion. It is an important effector controlling blood pressure and volume in the cardiovascular system. Angiotensin II receptor antagonists are drugs indicated for hypertension, diabetic nephropathy and congestive heart failure. Function The AT1 receptor mediates the major cardiovascular effects of angiotensin II. Effects include vasoconstriction, aldosterone synthesis and secretion, increased vasopressin secretion, cardiac hypertrophy, augmentation of peripheral noradrenergic activity, vascular smooth muscle cells proliferation, decreased renal blood flow, renal renin inhibition, renal tubular sodium reuptake, modulation of central sympathetic nervous system activity, cardiac contractility, central osmocontrol and extracellular matrix formation. Mechanism
Document 3 (Title: Enalaprilat -- Mechanism of Action): Enalaprilat is the active metabolite of the oral prodrug enalapril maleate. Enalaprilat is poorly absorbed orally and must be administered intravenously. It inhibits angiotensin I to angiotensin II conversion via competitive inhibition of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). [3] This inhibition disrupts the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Angiotensin II binds to AT1 receptors on smooth muscles to produce vasoconstriction and increased blood pressure. Additionally, angiotensin II  stimulates the adrenal cortex to secrete aldosterone. Aldosterone causes the distal tubules and collecting ducts of the kidneys to reabsorb water and sodium in exchange for potassium, which results in an expansion in extracellular volume and an increase in blood pressure. ACE inhibition leads to decreased plasma angiotensin II, leading to vasodilation and decreased aldosterone secretion. Angiotensin II also causes vasoconstriction of the afferent and efferent arterioles of the kidney, exerting a more significant effect on the efferent arterioles. Enalaprilat administration in the presence of hypovolemia can cause renal injury due to inadequate renal perfusion. [4] ACE breaks down bradykinin, a peptide that causes vasodilation. ACE inhibitors impede the breakdown of bradykinin, resulting in vasodilation and a bradykinin cough. [5]
Document 4 (Title: Why are converting enzyme inhibitors vasodilators?): 1. The primary action of the converting enzyme inhibitors to prevent the formation of angiotensin II can explain a decrease in peripheral vascular resistance in patients with elevated, but not in those with normal or reduced plasma renin levels. 2. The inhibition of the breakdown of bradykinin will potentiate the vasodilator properties of the endogenously produced peptide. These include direct relaxation of certain vascular smooth muscle, production of vasodilator prostanoids and release of endothelium-derived relaxing factor(s). The greater release of the latter in the kidney could exert a negative feedback on the release of renin. 3. In addition, converting enzyme inhibitors may directly (by a prejunctional effect) and indirectly (by curtailing the production of angiotensin II) reduce the release of noradrenaline in the blood vessel wall. 4. Converting enzyme inhibitors may also directly reduce the responsiveness of vascular smooth muscle to vasoconstrictor stimuli (e.g. alpha-adrenoceptor activation). 5. The different effects of these therapeutic agents may concur to induce peripheral vasodilatation.
Document 5 (Title: Angiotensin II receptor): Mechanism The angiotensin receptor is activated by the vasoconstricting peptide angiotensin II. The activated receptor in turn couples to Gq/11 and Gi/o and thus activates phospholipase C and increases the cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations, which in turn triggers cellular responses such as stimulation of protein kinase C. Activated receptor also inhibits adenylate cyclase and activates various tyrosine kinases. Effects Effects mediated by the AT1 receptor include vasoconstriction, aldosterone synthesis and secretion, increased vasopressin secretion, cardiac hypertrophy, augmentation of peripheral noradrenergic activity, vascular smooth muscle cells proliferation, decreased renal blood flow, renal renin inhibition, renal tubular sodium reuptake, modulation of central sympathetic nervous system activity, cardiac contractility, central osmocontrol and extracellular matrix formation.
