Document 1 (Title: Can the fall in Avon's sudden infant death rate be explained by changes in sleeping position?): To examine the impact of changing practice with regard to infant sleeping position on mortality from the sudden infant death syndrome. A population based study of all infants dying suddenly and unexpectedly during February 1990 to July 1991, and two groups of controls; one comprising every 125th baby born to Avon residents and the other comprising pairs of infants matched to each index case for age, neighbourhood, and date of study. Information about sleeping position was collected at home visits soon after the index baby's death or, for the population based controls, on several occasions in the first six months of life. The design was comparable to that of an earlier study of the same population. County of Avon. 35 infants who died suddenly and unexpectedly (32 of the sudden infant death syndrome), 70 matched controls, and 152 population based controls. The prevalence of prone sleeping in the matched controls was much lower than that found in an earlier study in Avon (28% (18/64) 1990-1 v 58% (76/131) 1987-9; p less than 0.001) and was comparable with the prevalence in population based controls (29%). This would be expected to lead to a reduction in the incidence of the sudden infant death syndrome to 2.0/1000 live births (95% confidence interval 1.8/1000 to 2.5/1000). The actual mortality fell from 3.5/1000 in 1987-9 to 1.7/1000. The fall in mortality can be almost entirely accounted for by the reduction in prone sleeping, suggesting a causal relation exists between them. Side and supine positions confer protection but the side position is unstable and the infant may roll prone. We therefore recommend supine as the safest sleeping position for babies.
Document 2 (Title: Safe to Sleep): In 1992, the first National Infant Sleep Position (NISP) Household Survey was conducted to determine the usual position in which U.S. mothers placed their babies to sleep: lateral (side), prone (stomach), supine (back), other, or no usual position. According to the 1992 NISP survey, 13.0% of U.S. infants were positioned in the supine position for sleep. According to the 2006 NISP survey 75.7% of infants were positioned in the supine position to sleep. According the CDC, the four tips for parents and caregivers to help a baby sleep safety are as follows: 1.)Place your baby on his or her back for all sleep times-naps and at night. 2.)Use a firm sleep surface, such as a mattress in a safety-approved crib. 3.) Keep soft bedding such as blankets, pillows, bumper pads, and soft toys out of baby’s sleep area. 4.) have baby share your room, not your bed.

Document 3 (Title: Biochemistry_Lippinco): 2.2. A 5-month-old boy is brought to his physician because of vomiting, night sweats, and tremors. History revealed that these symptoms began after fruit juices were introduced to his diet as he was being weaned off breast milk. The physical examination was remarkable for hepatomegaly. Tests on the baby’s urine were positive for reducing sugar but negative for glucose. The infant most likely suffers from a deficiency of: A. aldolase B. B. fructokinase. C. galactokinase. D. β-galactosidase.
Document 4 (Title: Sudden Infant Death Syndrome -- Deterrence and Patient Education): Medical professionals must be aware of current recommendations for safe sleeping practices and SIDS prevention: do not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs during pregnancy, place the infant on the back to sleep, allow the infant to sleep in his or her own crib in the same room as caregivers, and use a firm and flat surface in a safety-approved crib. Keep soft bedding or objects such as blankets, pillows, bumper pads, or toys out of the sleeping environment. Avoid covering the infant's head and avoid overheating. Avoid second-hand smoke. Smokers should change clothes and wash their hair before coming in contact with the infant. Infants and caregivers benefit from learning to use a pacifier at bedtime - Do Not Prop bottles in the baby's mouth! Breastfeeding and immunizations are beneficial.
Document 5 (Title: Sudden Infant Death Syndrome -- Deterrence and Patient Education): Despite a widespread campaign advocating for placing the baby in a supine position for sleep, the adherence to such behavior in the United States peaked at about 80% in 2015. Compliance never reached the targeted level. [36] In a large survey in the United States in 2019, 93% of parents recalled hearing about placing the baby in a supine position to sleep from clinicians, and only 78% of parents reported adhering to the recommendation. [37] Furthermore, parents were less likely to recall hearing about other safe sleeping practices, including avoiding soft objects in the vicinity of the bed (85%), safe sleeping surfaces (84%), and room-sharing without bed-sharing (50%).
