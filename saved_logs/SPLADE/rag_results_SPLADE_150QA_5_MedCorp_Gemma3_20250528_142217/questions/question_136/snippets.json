        "content": "The sensitivity of fluorophores has been an essential aspect of qPCR development. Two main types of fluorophores are used in qPCR: those that bind specifically to a given\u00a0target sequence and those that lack specificity in binding. One of the most effective and widely used non-specific markers, SYBR Green, after binding to the minor groove of dsDNA, exhibits a 1000-fold increase in fluorescence compared to being free in solution. However, if even more specificity is desired, a sequence-specific oligonucleotide, or hybridization probe, can be added, which binds to the target gene at some point, following\u00a0the primer (after the 3' end). These hybridization probes contain a reporter molecule at the 5' end and a quencher molecule at the 3' end. The quencher molecule effectively\u00a0inhibits the reporter from fluorescing while the probe is intact. However, upon contact with DNA polymerase I, the hybridization probe is cleaved, allowing the dye's fluorescence.",

        "content": "The kinetics of the fluorescence yield phi of chlorophyll a in Chlorella pyrenoidosa were studied under anaerobic conditions in the time range from 50 mus to several minutes after short (t 1/2 = 30 ns or 5 mus) saturating flashes. The fluorescence yield \"in the dark\" increased from phi = 1 at the beginning to phi approximately 5 in about 3 h when single flashes separated by dark intervals of about 3 min were given. After one saturating flash, phi increased to a maximum value (4-5) at 50 mus, then phi decreased to about 3 with a half time of about 10 ms and to the initial value with a half time of about 2 s. When two flashes separated by 0.2 s were given, the first phase of the decrease after the second flash occurred within 2 ms. After one flash given at high initial fluorescence yield, the 10-ms decay was followed by a 10 s increase to the initial value. After the two flashes 0.2 s apart, the rapid decay was not followed by a slow increase. These and other experiments provided additional evidence for and extend an earlier hypothesis concerning the acceptor complex of Photosystem II (Bouges-Bocquet, B. (1973) Biochim. Biophys.

Furthermore, the kinetics indicate that 2 reactions centers of System I, excited by a short flash, cooperate directly or indirectly in oxidizing a plastohydroquinone molecule (A2-). If initially all components between photoreaction 1 and 2 are in the reduced state the following sequence of reactions occurs after a flash has oxidised A2- via System I: Q-R2- + A leads to Q-R + A2- leads to QR- + A2-. During anaerobiosis two slow reactions manifest themselves: the reduction of R (and A) within 1 s, presumably by an endogenous electron donor D1, and the reduction of Q in about 10 s when R is in the state R- and A in the state A2-.
