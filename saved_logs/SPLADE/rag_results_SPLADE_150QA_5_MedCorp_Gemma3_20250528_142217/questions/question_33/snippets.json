        "content": "The authors report a case of pulmonary squamous cell carcinoma which occurred after chemotherapy of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). A 76-year-old man, who was admitted to our department because of swelling of cervical lymph nodes, was diagnosed as having NHL (follicular mixed cell lymphoma). He was treated with 11 courses of CHOP therapy. Thereafter, chemotherapy including ifosfamide was carried out for approximately three years. In June, 1991, he was readmitted to our department because of swelling and pain in his left thigh and an abnormal shadow on chest X-ray. Chest CT demonstrated a cavitated shadow (about 5 cm in diameter) with an irregular margin in right S1, which was suggested to be lung cancer or pulmonary infiltration of malignant lymphoma. Bronchoscopy, which was carried out on July 12, showed bloody sputa from the right B1 ramus and markedly reddened mucosa at the orifice of the right upper bronchus. Sputum cytology revealed no malignancy. ACVP-16 chemotherapy including ara-C, CBDCA and VP-16 was initiated on July 14 because of enlarged superficial lymph nodes. On July 18, he fell out of bed and fractured his left femur. He also suffered from respiratory failure. He died of pulmonary haemorrhage on July 26. Autopsy revealed pulmonary squamous cell carcinoma. The occurrence of pulmonary squamous cell carcinoma is rare after the chemotherapy of malignant lymphoma.",

        "content": "His physical exam revealed clear lungs and a normal heart exam on auscultation. His abdomen was soft and non-tender, and his skin was warm and dry with no rash. He had 2 plus pitting edema at the ankles. Initial laboratory data was consistent with acute kidney injury (AKI) with worsening creatinine from 1.2 to 1.6 over 1 month and nephrotic range proteinuria. Serologies for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, anti-nuclear antibody (ANA), c-ANCA, serine protease 3 (PR3) IgG, myeloperoxidase antibody (MPO), and complement levels were sent. He was started on losartan for proteinuria with plans for renal biopsy; however, he was lost to follow up. The patient then presented two weeks later with worsening edema to his waist, continued weight gain, mild hemoptysis, and streaks of blood in the stool. Physical examination now showed worsening pitting edema up to his waist with new non-pruritic, erythematous excoriations on the medial aspect of his thighs bilaterally. He was admitted to the hospital with concern for worsening vasculitis. He was started on oral prednisone and underwent a renal biopsy. For his edema, he was started on diuretics to which he responded well. Due to persistent leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing was performed to complete the workup.",

He had been relatively stable until the last 24 hours. Now, he is febrile (39.5\u00b0C [103.1\u00b0F]), and his white blood cell count has risen from 8500 to 20,000/mm3. He has also had an episode of hypo-tension (86/50 mmHg) that responded to a fluid bolus. Blood cultures were obtained at the time of his fever and results are pending. The ICU attending physician is concerned about a bloodstream infection and decides to treat with empiric com-bination therapy directed against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The combination therapy includes tobramycin. The patient weighs 70 kg (154 lb) and has an estimated creatinine clear-ance of 90 mL/min. How should tobramycin be dosed using once-daily and conventional dosing strategies? How should each regimen be monitored for efficacy and toxicity?",

        "content": "We reported a rare case of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of iliac bone which developed peripheral blood involvement associated with hypercalcemia. 42-year-old man was admitted to Fukui Medical School Hospital because of right iliac bone pain. An X-ray film of the pelvis disclosed the osteolytic change of right iliac bone. A CT scan of the pelvis showed soft tissue density tumors involved bilateral iliac bone. He had no superficial lymphadenopathy or organomegaly. Examination of peripheral blood and bone marrow did not show any abnormalities. Monoclonal immunoglobulin was not detected in serum. Examination of biopsied specimens from iliac bone tumor showed infiltration of round cells. Immunocytochemical analysis showed only MT-1 positive. He was treated with combination chemotherapy of vindesine, cyclophosphamide, prednisolone and pirarubicin followed by radiation therapy. But, there was no significant response. Following radiation therapy, he developed coma. Serum calcium was 9.8 mEq/l. The pathologic immature cells were found in peripheral blood. The bone marrow aspirates showed 63% pathologic cells. These cells expressed CD19, CD20, HLA-DR antigens. He was diagnosed as having leukemic non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, B-cell type, and was treated with combination chemotherapy. But he died of systemic fungal infection.",
