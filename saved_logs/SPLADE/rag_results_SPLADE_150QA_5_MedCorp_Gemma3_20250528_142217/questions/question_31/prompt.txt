With your own knowledge and the help of the following document:

Document 1 (Title: Empowering physicians to respond to domestic violence.): Despite the progress of the last 15 years in combating family violence, some individuals, community agencies and institutions still support a man's "right" to control, and they often disregard the physical violence he uses. Because threats and assault are in fact against the law, a man who physically or sexually assaults his wife or girlfriend couldn't keep doing it without this support from the very people who are supposed to enforce the law and help the victims of crime-namely, police, prosecutors, judges, clergy, psychologists, social workers and doctors. Some let him get away with it, look the other way, or--unsure of what to do to stop it--do nothing at all. Thus, they reinforce his "right" to use force, even if they never say, "Go ahead, hit her." The police officer who walks a man around the block or fails to show up when called, the clergyman who advises a woman to go home and pray, the doctor who gently patches her injuries but avoids asking who inflicted them, all cooperate with the abusive man in several ways. He comes to understand that no one will stop him from doing what he does. He learns that there are no consequences to his actions--even his violent actions. He can beat up "his woman" if he wants to and get away with it.
Document 2 (Title: Pramipexole -- Toxicity): A case report has been published in the literature describing attempted suicide with various medications. However, the overdose manifestations were more suggestive of pramipexole toxicity than that of other drugs. A 59-year-old male was brought to the hospital 5 hours after ingesting 3 mg pramipexole, 2250 mg venlafaxine SR, and 360 mg mirtazapine. His vitals were stable, and his neurological examination, including muscle tone and power, was normal. He was mildly agitated and had visual hallucinations. Nine hours later, he developed severe myoclonus to the extent he feared falling from bed. He consistently reported spiders crawling in the room and an alien man sitting on a chair next to him. He had some degree of urinary retention, was jittery and hypervigilant, and could not move due to postural dizziness. His routine blood reports were normal, with mild elevation in lactate. The serum concentration of pramipexole was significantly elevated at 34.2 ng/ml, around five times the upper limit of the therapeutic range. It decreased progressively, and the patient was then discharged after his symptoms subsided.
Document 3 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): Christian Lüscher, MD A 15-year-old high school student is brought to the emergency department after his parents found him in his room staring at the ceiling and visibly frightened. Earlier that evening, he attended a party but was depressed because his girlfriend just broke up with him. Jerry is failing this year at school and has stopped playing soccer. His parents are also worried about a change in his behavior over the last few months. He has lost interest in school, at times seems depressed, and tells his par-ents that his pocket money is not sufficient. When questioned by the intern, he reports that space-cookies were served at the party. He also says that smoking marijuana has become a habit (three to four joints a week) but denies consumption of alcohol and other drugs. How do you explain the state he was found in? What is the difference between hashish and marijuana? What may be the link to his poor performance at school? Are all drug users necessarily using several drugs?
Document 4 (Title: Where I'm Calling From): The main character, an unnamed man, has been dropped off at Frank Martin's alcohol rehabilitation center by his girlfriend, not to be confused with his wife. After arriving he encounters Joe Penny ("J.P") who starts telling him his story. J.P. is a chimney sweep drunk whose father-in-law and brother-in-law recently dropped him off at Frank Martin's as well. J.P. tells the story of how he met his wife, Roxy, one afternoon at a friend's house. She was a chimney sweep who asked to kiss J.P.’s friend when she was done cleaning his chimney. J.P. asked for a kiss as well. J.P dated Roxy, married her, and they have two children. As J.P. continues his story it becomes about how alcohol has ruined his marriage to his wife. Roxy comes to visit J.P. The story ends with the main character contemplating calling his wife or calling his girlfriend. The story title comes from the last few lines where he says:I won't raise my voice. Not even if she starts something. She'll ask me where I'm calling
Document 5 (Title: Pay It Forward (film)): Cast Kevin Spacey as Eugene Simonet, Trevor's social studies teacher, and an emotionally and physically scarred man. As a teenager, he suffered abuse from his father (including lighting him on fire) and still has burns visible on his face and torso. He begins the film as a shy recluse, self-conscious about his deformities, but eventually he enters a relationship with Trevor's mother Arlene and overcomes his fears. He sets an assignment to Trevor's class, asking them to change the world for the better. He is changed significantly from the novel, where there was an African-American man named Reuben St. Clair who had been injured in the Vietnam War. Helen Hunt as Arlene McKinney, Trevor's alcoholic, single mother who works at both a casino and a strip club. She has a past history of abusive relationships, especially with her mostly absent husband Ricky. She eventually enters a relationship with Eugene, and with his and Trevor's help manages to overcome her alcoholism and abuse.

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
Question: A 38-year-old man presents to his physician with double vision persisting for a week. When he enters the exam room, the physician notes that the patient has a broad-based gait. The man’s wife informs the doctor that he has been an alcoholic for the last 5 years and his consumption of alcohol has increased significantly over the past few months. She also reports that he has become indifferent to his family members over time and is frequently agitated. She also says that his memory has been affected significantly, and when asked about a particular detail, he often recollects it incorrectly, though he insists that his version is the true one. On physical examination, his vital signs are stable, but when the doctor asks him where he is, he seems to be confused. His neurological examination also shows nystagmus. Which of the following options describes the earliest change in the pathophysiology of the central nervous system in this man?
Options:
A. Decreased α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase activity in astrocytes
B. Increased extracellular concentration of glutamate
C. Increased astrocyte lactate
