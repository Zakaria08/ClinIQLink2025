        "title": "Inactivation of muscle chloride channel by transposon insertion in myotonic mice.",
        "content": "MYOTONIA (stiffness and impaired relaxation of skeletal muscle) is a symptom of several diseases caused by repetitive firing of action potentials in muscle membranes. Purely myotonic human diseases are dominant myotonia congenita (Thomsen) and recessive generalized myotonia (Becker), whereas myotonic dystrophy is a systemic disease. Muscle hyperexcitability was attributed to defects in sodium channels and/or to a decrease in chloride conductance (in Becker's myotonia and in genetic animal models). Experimental blockage of Cl- conductance (normally 70-85% of resting conductance in muscle) in fact elicits myotonia. ADR mice are a realistic animal model for recessive autosomal myotonia. In addition to Cl- conductance, many other parameters are changed in muscles of homozygous animals. We have now cloned the major mammalian skeletal muscle chloride channel (ClC-1). Here we report that in ADR mice a transposon of the ETn family has inserted into the corresponding gene, destroying its coding potential for several membrane-spanning domains. Together with the lack of recombination between the Clc-1 gene and the adr locus, this strongly suggests a lack of functional chloride channels as the primary cause of mouse myotonia.",

        "content": "Members of the CLC channel family, are named as CIC-1, 2, 3, etc., and are voltage-gated channels that modulate a verity of cellular functions. CIC-1 is the major Cl- channel in skeletal muscle, maintaining the resting potential of the sarcoplasmic reticulum and regulating repolarization after contraction. CIC-2 is expressed ubiquitously and activated by cellular swelling, acidic pH and hyperpolarization, modulating intracellular chloride concentration, cell volume regulation, and modifying neuronal excitability. CIC-5 is predominantly expressed in the kidneys and may play a part of proximal tubule endocytosis. CIC-3 and CIC-4 function are not clearly understood and under investigation. ClC-K/Barttin channels are two members of the CLC family that function in basolateral Cl- recycling and are also predominantly expressed in the kidney (thick ascending loop of Henle and distal nephron) and inner ear.\u00a0CFTR is a voltage-independent chloride channel located in the apical membrane of many epithelia, most predominantly in those of the airways, intestines, secretory glands, epididymis, and bile ducts. In some epithelial, such as that of the intestine, CFTR may account for the entire apical chloride conductance and thus plays a crucial role in salt and fluid secretion and absorption. CFTR may also be essential in the acidification of the Golgi bodies and endosomes and has been studied as a regulator of other ion channels such as ENaC.\u00a0GABA- and glycine-gated chloride channels function to regulate membrane electrical excitability, specifically, by causing neuronal inhibition. GABA is predominantly used in the brain, while glycine is more common in the spinal cord and brain stem. In adult brains, binding of these neurotransmitters to their corresponding ligand-gated anion channel causes Cl- influx into the cell, which leads to hyperpolarization and neuronal activity inhibition. However, early in development, a more positive equilibrium potential of Cl- in undeveloped neurons causes excitability in response to GABA and glycine. Glycine receptors control motor rhythm generation, coordinate spinal reflex responses, and modulate processing by sensory neurons. [3] [5]",
