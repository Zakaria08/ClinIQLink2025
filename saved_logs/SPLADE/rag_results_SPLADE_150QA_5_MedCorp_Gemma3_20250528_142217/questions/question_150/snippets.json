Other conventional hepatic biochemical tests such as serum aminotransferases and alkaline phosphatase are normal, and there is no evidence of hemolysis. Hepatic histology is also essentially normal except for the occasional presence of bile plugs within canaliculi. Bilirubin glucuronides are virtually absent from the bile, and there is no detectable constitutive expression of UGT1A1 activity in hepatic tissue. Neither UGT1A1 activity nor the serum bilirubin concentration responds to administration of phenobarbital or other enzyme inducers. In the absence of conjugation, unconjugated bilirubin accumulates in plasma, from which it is eliminated very slowly by alternative pathways that include direct passage into the bile and small intestine. These account for the small amounts of urobilinogen",

        "content": "Intrahepatic cholestasis associated with severe extrahepatic bacterial infection is well recognized in humans. A similar syndrome is not well characterized in veterinary medicine. Five dogs with severe extrahepatic bacterial infection that developed histologically confirmed intrahepatic cholestasis were selected from the authors' case files. The types of infections included pneumonia, peritonitis secondary to a rectal tear, urinary tract infection, bite wounds, and vegetative endocarditis. Escherichia coli was involved in two of the dogs, mixed infection in one dog, and a gram-positive cocci in the other two dogs. Total bilirubin concentrations ranged from 3.5 to 33.5 mg/dl. Serum liver enzyme activities showed only mild to moderate increases: alkaline phosphatase (ALP, 41-750 IU/l), alanine aminotransferase (ALT, 25-235 IU/l), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST, 99-255 IU/l). Fasting serum bile acids concentration was markedly elevated in the one dog in which it was measured (259 mumol/l). Histologically, the cholestasis was characterized by bile pigment accumulation in hepatocytes, canaliculi, and/or Kupffer's cells. Inflammatory parenchymal changes, when present, were minimal. The findings of hyperbilirubinemia, only a slight increase in the liver enzyme activities, and minimal inflammatory changes in liver tissue specimens in the five dogs with extrahepatic bacterial infections are similar to the findings in intrahepatic cholestasis associated with extrahepatic bacterial infection in humans.",

        "content": "In patients aged 10\u201320 years, serum concentrations of bilirubin, bile acids and transaminases (alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase) reached normal or almost optimal values. Patients without observed liver cirrhosis compared to the control group had elevated levels of ALP (alkaline phosphatase) and GGT (gamma-glutamyl transferase). There was no significant difference in serum bile acid concentrations between patients and control group. However, test patients had lower values for total protein, CRP, albumin and creatinine. Moreover, the value for fibrinogen was higher in patients with Aagenaes syndrome. There was only a slight increase in mean cell hemoglobin (MCH) in terms of erythrocyte, leukocyte and platelet counts. Serum albumin concentrations decreased with age, but not in the control group.",

        "content": "Hyperbilirubinemia is a condition defined as elevated serum or plasma bilirubin levels above the reference range of the laboratory, and it is due to disorders of bilirubin metabolism. Depending on the form of bilirubin present in serum, hyperbilirubinemia can be further classified as unconjugated (indirect) or conjugated (direct). Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia (albumin-bound) usually results from increased production, impaired hepatic uptake, and decreased conjugation of bilirubin. [1] [2] In neonates, jaundice typically occurs due to unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, which is characterized by the increased levels of indirect or unconjugated bilirubin (UCB) in the serum. In newborns, the increased concentration of UCB can cross the blood-brain barrier, and deposit in the basal ganglia or cerebellum causing a bilirubin-induced encephalopathy or kernicterus [3] . Several inherited disorders can also produce unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, including Gilbert syndrome, Crigler-Najjar syndromes type I and II, and inherited disorders causing hemolytic anemia.

        "content": "The provider should order a white blood cell count, hemoglobin/hematocrit, platelet count, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase. In a patient with cholelithiasis, total bilirubin of greater than 3 mg/dL to 4 mg/dL, is strongly associated with choledocholithiasis. Gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase is also elevated. Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) concentrations are elevated in biliary obstruction in a cholestatic pattern, with increases in alkaline phosphatase, serum bilirubin, and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) exceeding the elevations in serum AST and ALT. The positive predictive value of elevated liver tests is poor because liver tests are elevated due to a variety of other etiologies too. Thus, normal levels help in excluding choledocholithiasis. Symptom resolution, coupled with down-trending liver function tests, suggests that a patient has spontaneously passed the gallstone. A lipase should also be checked to assess for gallstone pancreatitis. An INR with prothrombin time can be ordered to assess the intrinsic liver function as well.",
