With your own knowledge and the help of the following document:

Document 1 (Title: Endocrine system): Gonads The reproductive system begins development at four to five weeks of gestation with germ cell migration. The bipotential gonad results from the collection of the medioventral region of the urogenital ridge. At the five-week point, the developing gonads break away from the adrenal primordium. Gonadal differentiation begins 42 days following conception. Male gonadal development For males, the testes form at six fetal weeks and the sertoli cells begin developing by the eight week of gestation. SRY, the sex-determining locus, serves to differentiate the Sertoli cells. The Sertoli cells are the point of origin for anti-Müllerian hormone. Once synthesized, the anti-Müllerian hormone initiates the ipsilateral regression of the Müllerian tract and inhibits the development of female internal features. At 10 weeks of gestation, the Leydig cells begin to produce androgen hormones. The androgen hormone dihydrotestosterone is responsible for the development of the male external genitalia.
Document 2 (Title: Risk Management Event Evaluation and Responsibilities -- Issues of Concern -- Patient Handoff): For example, handoff of a patient following the "I-PASS" system would be structured as follows: "This patient is a watcher. Ms. X is a 65-year-old female, anticoagulated on apixaban, who presented to the ED after a mechanical fall. She was neurologically intact, but her head CT showed a subdural hematoma without midline shift, so she was admitted to the ICU. She needs neurological checks every 1 hour and a repeat head CT in 4 hours. Should she have an acute mental status change, please plan to reverse her anticoagulation, consider intubating her and giving hypertonic saline, obtain a STAT head CT, and contact neurosurgery immediately. "After this, the receiving provider would summarize the patient and repeat the action points back to ensure proper understanding.
Document 3 (Title: Biochemistry_Lippinco): Choose the ONE best answer. For Questions 26.1 and 26.2, use the following scenario. A 40-year-old woman, 5 ft, 1 in (155 cm) tall and weighing 188 lb (85.5 kg), seeks your advice on how to lose weight. Her waist measured 41 in and her hips 39 in. The remainder of the physical examination and the blood laboratory data were all within the normal range. Her only child (who is age 14 years), her sister, and both of her parents are overweight. The patient recalls being overweight throughout her childhood and adolescence. Over the past 15 years, she had been on seven different diets for periods of 2 weeks to 3 months, losing from 5 to 25 lb each time. On discontinuation of the diets, she regained weight, returning to 185–190 lb. 6.1. Calculate and interpret the body mass index for the patient. Body mass index (BMI) = weight in kg/(height in m)2 = 85.5/1.552 = 35.6. Because her BMI is >30, the patient is classified as obese.
Document 4 (Title: [An emergency cesarean section using general anesthesia for a patient with schizophrenia].): A 27 year-old female in 39th week gestation with schizophrenia underwent an emergency Cesarean section using general anesthesia. A diagnosis of schizophrenia was made two years previously, since then oral anti-psychotic drugs such as chlorpromazine had been given to her. In June 1989 she suddenly became excited and generalized muscle rigidity was observed without any triggering episodes. Her excitement was so marked that we had to administer intramuscular levomepromazine 75 mg and diazepam 10 mg to her, but they failed to sedate her adequately. Emergency Cesarean section was scheduled to overcome this situation. Spinal or epidural anesthesia was not indicated because of her vigorous excitement, and anesthesia was induced with thiopental 350 mg and succinylcholine 40 mg. Induction-delivery time was 12 minutes. Pentazocine 30 mg in combination with nitrous oxide was given for the maintenance of anesthesia. Plasma levomepromazine levels were 46.9 ng.ml-1 in the mother and 11.3 ng.ml-1 in the umbilical vein, respectively. The baby's Apgar score was 9 and 1 min and 9 at 5 min after the delivery. The baby developed slight generalized tremor until next day, probably due to effect of levomepromazine given before the Cesarean section. The patient was discharged without any cardiorespiratory trouble and her baby has been doing well so far.
Document 5 (Title: Biochemistry_Lippinco): Patient Presentation: BE is a 45-year-old woman who presents with concerns about sudden (paroxysmal), intense, brief episodes of headache, sweating (diaphoresis), and a racing heart (palpitations). Focused History: BE reports that the attacks started ~3 weeks ago. They last from 2 to 10 minutes, during which time she feels quite anxious. During the attacks, it feels as though her heart is skipping beats (arrhythmia). At first, she thought the attacks were related to recent stress at work and maybe even menopause. The last time it happened, she was in a pharmacy and had her blood pressure taken. She was told it was 165/110 mm Hg. BE notes that she has lost weight (~8 lbs) in this period even though her appetite has been good.

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
Question: A 31-year-old G2P2 female at 40 weeks gestation presents to the hospital following a rush of water that came from her vagina. She is 4 cm dilated and 80% effaced. Fetal heart tracing shows a pulse of 155/min with variable decelerations. About 12 hours after presentation, she gives birth to a 6 lb 15 oz baby boy with APGAR scores of 8 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. Which of the following structures is responsible for inhibition of female internal genitalia?
Options:
A. Spermatogonia
B. Allantois
C. Syncytiotrophoblast
D. Sertoli cells
