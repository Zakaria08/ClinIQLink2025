        "content": "Gonads The reproductive system begins development at four to five weeks of gestation with germ cell migration. The bipotential gonad results from the collection of the medioventral region of the urogenital ridge. At the five-week point, the developing gonads break away from the adrenal primordium. Gonadal differentiation begins 42 days following conception. Male gonadal development For males, the testes form at six fetal weeks and the sertoli cells begin developing by the eight week of gestation. SRY, the sex-determining locus, serves to differentiate the Sertoli cells. The Sertoli cells are the point of origin for anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone. Once synthesized, the anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone initiates the ipsilateral regression of the M\u00fcllerian tract and inhibits the development of female internal features. At 10 weeks of gestation, the Leydig cells begin to produce androgen hormones. The androgen hormone dihydrotestosterone is responsible for the development of the male external genitalia.",

The patient recalls being overweight throughout her childhood and adolescence. Over the past 15 years, she had been on seven different diets for periods of 2 weeks to 3 months, losing from 5 to 25 lb each time. On discontinuation of the diets, she regained weight, returning to 185\u2013190 lb. 6.1. Calculate and interpret the body mass index for the patient. Body mass index (BMI) = weight in kg/(height in m)2 = 85.5/1.552 = 35.6. Because her BMI is >30, the patient is classified as obese.",

        "content": "A 27 year-old female in 39th week gestation with schizophrenia underwent an emergency Cesarean section using general anesthesia. A diagnosis of schizophrenia was made two years previously, since then oral anti-psychotic drugs such as chlorpromazine had been given to her. In June 1989 she suddenly became excited and generalized muscle rigidity was observed without any triggering episodes. Her excitement was so marked that we had to administer intramuscular levomepromazine 75 mg and diazepam 10 mg to her, but they failed to sedate her adequately. Emergency Cesarean section was scheduled to overcome this situation. Spinal or epidural anesthesia was not indicated because of her vigorous excitement, and anesthesia was induced with thiopental 350 mg and succinylcholine 40 mg. Induction-delivery time was 12 minutes. Pentazocine 30 mg in combination with nitrous oxide was given for the maintenance of anesthesia. Plasma levomepromazine levels were 46.9 ng.ml-1 in the mother and 11.3 ng.ml-1 in the umbilical vein, respectively. The baby's Apgar score was 9 and 1 min and 9 at 5 min after the delivery. The baby developed slight generalized tremor until next day, probably due to effect of levomepromazine given before the Cesarean section. The patient was discharged without any cardiorespiratory trouble and her baby has been doing well so far.",
