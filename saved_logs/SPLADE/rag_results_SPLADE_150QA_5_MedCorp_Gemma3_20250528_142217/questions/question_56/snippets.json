        "content": "Push enteroscopy is performed with a long endoscope similar in design to an upper endoscope. The enteroscope is pushed down the small bowel, sometimes with the help of a stiffening overtube that extends from the mouth to the small intestine. The proximal to mid-jejunum is usually reached, and the instrument channel of the endoscope allows for biopsy or endoscopic therapy. Deeper insertion into the small bowel can be accomplished by single-or double-balloon enteroscopy or spiral enteroscopy (Fig. 345-9). These instruments enable pleating of the small intestine onto an over-tube (see Video 346e-1). With balloon-assisted enteroscopy, the entire intestinal tract can be visualized in some patients when both the oral and anal routes of insertion are used. Biopsies and endoscopic therapy can be performed throughout the visualized small bowel (Fig. 345-10).",

        "title": "Comparison of single rubber-nylon balloon and double polyethylene balloon valvuloplasty in 94 patients with rheumatic mitral stenosis.",
        "content": "To compare the single rubber-nylon balloon and double polyethylene balloon techniques, 94 patients with rheumatic mitral stenosis underwent percutaneous transseptal balloon mitral valvuloplasty between November 1985 and September 1988. The single balloon technique was used in 73 patients and the double balloon technique was used in 21. The two groups were similar in age, weight, severity of the lesion, and cardiac functional status. The mean mitral valve diastolic gradient decreased from 17.9 +/- 6.5 to 2.9 +/- 3.1 mm Hg (p less than 0.001), 18.5 +/- 6.7 to 5.8 +/- 3.1 mm Hg (p less than 0.001), and 18.1 +/- 5.9 to 3.2 +/- 3.7 mm Hg (p less than 0.001) in the single balloon group, double balloon group, and the entire series, respectively. The final mitral diastolic gradient in the single balloon group was lower than in the double balloon group (p less than 0.05). Complications in the single balloon group were lower than in the double balloon group. Additional advantages of single over double balloon technique were easier maneuverability and higher success rate. The initial and long-term follow-up results confirmed the earlier impressions that percutaneous transseptal balloon mitral valvuloplasty is an effective and safe nonsurgical method of treatment for rheumatic mitral stenosis, and the single rubber-nylon balloon technique is at least as effective as, if not superior to, the double polyethylene balloon technique.",

        "content": "Percutaneous pulmonary valvuloplasty with a double-balloon technique was used in eight patients, aged 10-40 years, in whom valvuloplasty with a single 20-mm balloon resulted in inadequate dilatation of the stenosis. The diameters of the additional balloon varied from 10 to 20 mm. Balloons were inflated manually at about 30-45 psi (206.7-310.1 kPa) and deflated immediately after disappearance of the balloon waist. The mean peak systolic pressure gradient was 85 mm Hg +/- 37 before valvuloplasty, and it decreased to 38 mm Hg +/- 28 afterward (P less than .05). Double-balloon dilation and simultaneous computed tomography were done in two cardiac specimens from adult cadavers. At inflations at 30 and 45 psi (206.7 and 310.1 kPa), the outflow tract was elongated, and the balloons also deformed into ovoid shape at the lower pressure. The double-balloon technique appears to be safe and effective for relief of pulmonary valvular stenosis in those cases in which single-balloon technique is inadequate, especially in older children and adults.",
