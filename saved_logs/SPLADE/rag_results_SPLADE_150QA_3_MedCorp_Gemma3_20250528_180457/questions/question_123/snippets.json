Knowing this it is advisable to monitor those functions continuously using an EKG. As there is no antidote against bufotalin all occurring symptoms need to be treated separately or if possible in combination with others. To increase the clearance theoretically, due to the similarities with digitoxin, cholestyramine, a bile salt, might help. Recent animal studies have shown that taurine restores cardiac functions. Symptomatic measures include lignocaine, atropine and phenytoin for cardiac toxicity and intravenous potassium compounds to correct hyperkalaemia from its effect on the Na+/K+ ATPase pump.",

        "title": "Ketoacidosis -- Treatment / Management",
        "content": "Aggressive volume resuscitation with isotonic saline infusion is recommended in the initial management of DKA. Volume expansion not only corrects the hemodynamic instability but also improves insulin sensitivity and reduces counter-regulatory hormone levels. After starting with isotonic saline, the subsequent options can be decided on the serum sodium levels that are corrected for the level of hyperglycemia. Normal or high serum sodium levels warrant replacement with hypotonic saline, and low sodium levels warrant continuation of the isotonic saline. This fluid has to be supplemented with dextrose once the level reaches around 200 to 250 mg/dl. Along with fluids, an intravenous infusion of regular insulin has to be initiated to maintain the blood glucose level between 150 to 200 mg/dl and until the high anion-gap acidosis is resolved in DKA. Like mentioned above, potassium levels are usually high because of the transcellular shifts due to the acidosis and the lack of insulin. When the potassium levels are low, this means that the total body potassium is low, and hence, insulin therapy should be postponed till at least the level of serum potassium is greater than 3.3 mEq/L. Otherwise, a\u00a0further drop in levels would put the patient at risk for cardiac arrhythmias. In the 3.3 to 5 mEq/L; range, supplementation should be added in the maintenance fluids to target a steady 4.0 to 5.0 mEq/L range, and if higher than that, insulin and intravenous fluids alone can be started with just the frequent monitoring of the serum potassium level. The treatment of the acidosis itself is more controversial. Treatment with sodium bicarbonate therapy is controversial. It has been studied and found to provide no added benefit when the arterial blood pH is greater than 6.9 and may be associated with more harm. [7] A 2011 systematic review found that bicarbonate administration worsened ketonemia. Several studies have found higher potassium requirements in patients receiving bicarbonate. Studies in children have observed\u00a0a possible association between bicarbonate therapy and cerebral edema. [8]",

        "title": "[Treatment of severe digitalis-intoxication in suicidal attempt (author's transl)].",
        "content": "4 patients tried to commit suicide by ingestion of 45 to 100 tablets of digoxin (Lanicor 0,25 mg) and acteyldigoxin (Novodigal 0,2 mg) respectively. In all patients cardiac arrhythmias occurred including 3 rd degree av-block, tachyarrhythmias and ventricular fibrillation which was lethal in two patients. After a short period hyperkaliaemia a rapid decrease of potassium in the serum was observed 3-12 hours after administration of digoxin. This loss of potassium was due to an increased excretion of potassium and sodium in the urine. It is thought that a reversible tubular leakage is responsible for the loss of electrolytes by the kidney rather than an inhibition of the ATPase in kidney tissue. From our observations the following therapy scheme for digitalis-intoxication is recommended: 1. Gastric lavage and administration of absorbents (charcoal, cholestyramin) in order to decrease the absorption of the glycosides and to interrupt the enterohepatic circulation. 2. Substitution of electrolytes by infusions and by oral route to balance sodium and potassium levels in the serum. 3. Administration of diphenylhydantoin for treatment of cardiac arrhythmias. 4. Implantation of a temporary pacemaker for treatment of cardiac arrhythmias especially for the management of bradycardias. 5. Plasmapheresis to lower the glycosid concentration in the heart muscle and in other tissues.",
