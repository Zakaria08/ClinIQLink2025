With your own knowledge and the help of the following document:

Document 1 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Crigler-Najjar Syndrome, Type I CN-I is characterized by striking uncon jugated hyperbilirubinemia of about 340–765 μmol/L (20–45 mg/dL) that appears in the neonatal period and persists for life. Other conventional hepatic biochemical tests such as serum aminotransferases and alkaline phosphatase are normal, and there is no evidence of hemolysis. Hepatic histology is also essentially normal except for the occasional presence of bile plugs within canaliculi. Bilirubin glucuronides are virtually absent from the bile, and there is no detectable constitutive expression of UGT1A1 activity in hepatic tissue. Neither UGT1A1 activity nor the serum bilirubin concentration responds to administration of phenobarbital or other enzyme inducers. In the absence of conjugation, unconjugated bilirubin accumulates in plasma, from which it is eliminated very slowly by alternative pathways that include direct passage into the bile and small intestine. These account for the small amounts of urobilinogen
Document 2 (Title: Aagenaes syndrome): In patients aged 10–20 years, serum concentrations of bilirubin, bile acids and transaminases (alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase) reached normal or almost optimal values. Patients without observed liver cirrhosis compared to the control group had elevated levels of ALP (alkaline phosphatase) and GGT (gamma-glutamyl transferase). There was no significant difference in serum bile acid concentrations between patients and control group. However, test patients had lower values for total protein, CRP, albumin and creatinine. Moreover, the value for fibrinogen was higher in patients with Aagenaes syndrome. There was only a slight increase in mean cell hemoglobin (MCH) in terms of erythrocyte, leukocyte and platelet counts. Serum albumin concentrations decreased with age, but not in the control group.
Document 3 (Title: Cholestasis associated with extrahepatic bacterial infection in five dogs.): Intrahepatic cholestasis associated with severe extrahepatic bacterial infection is well recognized in humans. A similar syndrome is not well characterized in veterinary medicine. Five dogs with severe extrahepatic bacterial infection that developed histologically confirmed intrahepatic cholestasis were selected from the authors' case files. The types of infections included pneumonia, peritonitis secondary to a rectal tear, urinary tract infection, bite wounds, and vegetative endocarditis. Escherichia coli was involved in two of the dogs, mixed infection in one dog, and a gram-positive cocci in the other two dogs. Total bilirubin concentrations ranged from 3.5 to 33.5 mg/dl. Serum liver enzyme activities showed only mild to moderate increases: alkaline phosphatase (ALP, 41-750 IU/l), alanine aminotransferase (ALT, 25-235 IU/l), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST, 99-255 IU/l). Fasting serum bile acids concentration was markedly elevated in the one dog in which it was measured (259 mumol/l). Histologically, the cholestasis was characterized by bile pigment accumulation in hepatocytes, canaliculi, and/or Kupffer's cells. Inflammatory parenchymal changes, when present, were minimal. The findings of hyperbilirubinemia, only a slight increase in the liver enzyme activities, and minimal inflammatory changes in liver tissue specimens in the five dogs with extrahepatic bacterial infections are similar to the findings in intrahepatic cholestasis associated with extrahepatic bacterial infection in humans.
