Document 1 (Title: Carotid-cavernous fistula): A carotid-cavernous fistula results from an abnormal communication between the arterial and venous systems within the cavernous sinus in the skull. It is a type of arteriovenous fistula. As arterial blood under high pressure enters the cavernous sinus, the normal venous return to the cavernous sinus is impeded and this causes engorgement of the draining veins, manifesting most dramatically as a sudden engorgement and redness of the eye of the same side. Presentation CCF symptoms include bruit (a humming sound within the skull due to high blood flow through the arteriovenous fistula), progressive visual loss, and pulsatile proptosis or progressive bulging of the eye due to dilatation of the veins draining the eye. Pain is the symptom that patients often find the most difficult to tolerate. Patients usually present with sudden or insidious onset of redness in one eye, associated with progressive proptosis or bulging.They may have a history of similar episodes in the past.
Document 2 (Title: [Three cases of spontaneous bilateral external carotid-cavernous sinus fistula (dural arteriovenous shunts in the region of the cavernous sinus) (author's transl)].): Since Fincher reported a case with arteriovenous fistula between the external carotid artery and dural sinus, many type of cases have been reported. On the other hand, so called the external carotid avernous fistula has been recognized less 20 cases in literature. We have observed three additional cases of dural arteriovenous shunts in the region of the cavernous sinus. Case 1. A 52 year old woman had suffered from left side sever headache. There was weakness of the left extraocular muscles and left ptosis. A bruit was heard over the left orbit. She was treated for hypertension since 38 year old. And she has no history of recent trauma. Selective internal and external carotid angiographies showed the bilateral external carotid cavernous sinus fistula. No operative treatment was performed in this case and the symptomes disappeared with decrease of blood pressure. Case 2. A 50 year old man came to this clinic with chief complaints of right ptosis, diplopia and headache. He was treated for diabetes mellitus and hypertension for six month...
Document 3 (Title: Malignant Orbital Tumors -- History and Physical): A complete ophthalmic examination, including visual acuity, pupillary response, extraocular muscle function, exophthalmometry, tonometry, and fundoscopy, is required. Skin, conjunctival, and corneal sensation, along with any lid lag, should also be documented. Findings such as tortuous conjunctival vessels or choroidal-retinal folds may point towards orbital pathology. For the measurement of ptosis, the margin-to-reflex distance, which is the distance in millimeters between the corneal light reflex to the upper eyelid (MRD1) or lower eyelid (MRD2), can be used to measure eyelid positioning, ptosis, lagophthalmos, ectropion, and scleral show. A complete cranial nerve examination is required, with special attention paid to V1, V2, V3, and any pain with ocular movements. Unilateral proptosis points more towards primary or secondary orbital pathology rather than a systemic disease like Graves ophthalmopathy. Asymmetry of >2 mm between the prominence of the 2 eyes is considered significant. Palpation may reveal a firm globe with restricted mobility, which is worrisome for orbital malignancy.

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
Question: A 46-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 2-week history of diplopia and ocular pain when reading the newspaper. She also has a 3-month history of amenorrhea, hot flashes, and increased sweating. She reports that she has been overweight all her adult life and is happy to have lost 6.8-kg (15-lb) of weight in the past 2 months. Her pulse is 110/min, and blood pressure is 148/98 mm Hg. Physical examination shows moist palms and a nontender thyroid gland that is enlarged to two times its normal size. Ophthalmologic examination shows prominence of the globes of the eyes, bilateral lid retraction, conjunctival injection, and an inability to converge the eyes. There is no pain on movement of the extraocular muscles. Visual acuity is 20/20 bilaterally. Neurologic examination shows a fine resting tremor of the hands. Deep tendon reflexes are 3+ with a shortened relaxation phase. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's ocular complaints?
Options:
A. Granulomatous inflammation of the cavernous sinus
B. Abnormal communication between the cavernous sinus and the internal carotid artery
C. Glycosaminoglycan accumulation in the orbit
D. Sympathetic hyperactivity of levator palpebrae superioris
