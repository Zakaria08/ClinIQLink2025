        "title": "[Sudden death due to bilateral pulmonary thromboembolism in a patient with multiple myeloma: an autopsy case report].",
        "content": "We encountered a patient with multiple myeloma who died suddenly, in whom bilateral pulmonary artery thrombosis was found at autopsy. The patient was a 50-year-old woman who had received chemotherapy for multiple myeloma at a local clinic for 4 years, and was transferred to our hospital because of recurrence of multiple myeloma in August 1990. Despite chemotherapy performed after admission, serum globulin level increased and her low back pain worsened, and she was generally restricted to bed. On October 21, she developed sudden dyspnea, became markedly cyanotic, lost consciousness, and then suffered a cardiopulmonary arrest. Autopsy revealed bilateral pulmonary artery thrombosis as well as thrombosis in the pelvic veins. Hyperviscosity due to multiple myeloma and long-term recumbency were the probable causes of pelvic venous thrombosis and subsequent pulmonary artery thrombosis. We report a rare case of bilateral pulmonary artery thrombosis which developed during the course of multiple myeloma and led to sudden death.",

        "content": "The patient is a 60-year-old white female presenting to the emergency department with acute onset shortness of breath.\u00a0 Symptoms began approximately 2 days before and had progressively worsened with no associated, aggravating, or relieving factors noted. She had similar symptoms approximately 1 year ago with an acute, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation requiring hospitalization. She uses BiPAP ventilatory support at night when sleeping and has requested to use this in the emergency department due to shortness of breath and wanting to sleep. She denies fever, chills, cough, wheezing, sputum production, chest pain, palpitations, pressure, abdominal pain, abdominal distension, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.",

        "title": "Pulmonary edema",
        "content": "Pulmonary edema (PE), also known as pulmonary congestion, is liquid accumulation in the tissue and air spaces of the lungs. It leads to impaired gas exchange and may cause respiratory failure. It is due to either failure of the left ventricle of the heart to remove blood adequately from the pulmonary circulation (cardiogenic pulmonary edema), or an injury to the lung tissue or blood vessels of the lung (non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema). Treatment is focused on three aspects: firstly improving respiratory function, secondly, treating the underlying cause, and thirdly avoiding further damage to the lung. Pulmonary edema, especially when sudden (acute), can lead to respiratory failure or cardiac arrest due to hypoxia. It is a cardinal feature of congestive heart failure. The term edema is from the Greek (oid\u0113ma, \"swelling\"), from \u03bf\u1f30\u03b4\u03ad\u03c9 (oid\u00e9\u014d, \"(I) swell\").",
