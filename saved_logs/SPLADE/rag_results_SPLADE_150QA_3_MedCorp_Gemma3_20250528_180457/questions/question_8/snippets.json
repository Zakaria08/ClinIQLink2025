        "title": "[Spontaneous vaginal delivery in a case of total placenta previa (author's transl)].",
        "content": "In a 26 year old gravida 2, Para O, Aborta 1, a total placenta previa was diagnosed at 30 weeks gestation in an ultrasound tomogram. A repeat ultrasound examination 9 weeks later showed no more placenta previa in front of the cervix. This was at first interpreted as a change in the site of the placenta during the pregnancy. During the spontaneous labour the contractions, fetal heart rate and the intermittent scalp pH were monitored. A spontaneous vertex presentation delivery of a normal infant through the placenta resulted. Microscopic examination of the placenta showed a central defect with wide marginal infarcts probably due to compression atrophy by the presenting part.",

        "title": "Pyloric stenosis",
        "content": "Cause Rarely, infantile pyloric stenosis can occur as an autosomal dominant condition. It is uncertain whether it is a congenital anatomic narrowing or a functional hypertrophy of the pyloric sphincter muscle. Pathophysiology The gastric outlet obstruction due to the hypertrophic pylorus impairs emptying of gastric contents into the duodenum. As a consequence, all ingested food and gastric secretions can only exit via vomiting, which can be of a projectile nature. While the exact cause of the hypertrophy remains unknown, one study suggested that neonatal hyperacidity may be involved in the pathogenesis. This physiological explanation for the development of clinical pyloric stenosis at around 4 weeks and its spontaneous long term cure without surgery if treated conservatively, has recently been further reviewed.",
