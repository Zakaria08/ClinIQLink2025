Document 1 (Title: Infectious mononucleosis and mononucleosis syndromes.): Infectious mononucleosis (IM) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) mononucleosis are caused by a primary infection with related viruses, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and CMV. Despite the similarity of clinical manifestations, basic differences exist: (1) The heterophil antibody (HA) response is absent in CMV mononucleosis, whereas it is present in IM. (2) In IM atypical lymphocytosis reflects proliferation of B cells early and of T cells later in the disease course; in CMV mononucleosis the situation appears complex. (3) In blood, EBV is restricted to B lymphocytes, whereas CMV is found in polymorphonuclear and mononuclear leukocytes. (4) Complications of CMV mononucleosis such as hepatitis and pneumonitis may be due to virus cytopathic effect in target organs. Prominent tonsillopharyngitis with adenopathy, and visceral complications of IM are related to lymphoproliferation which is self-limited except in males with a rare familial defect in defense against EBV. Immune complex-mediated pathology may occur in both diseases. (5) CMV is frequently transmitted to a fetus in utero or to an infant during or after birth, and this occasionally leads to severe cytomegalic inclusion disease; vertical transmission of EBV appears to be exceptional. (6) Secondary EBV infections are associated with certain malignancies whereas such an association has not been recognized in the case of CMV. Toxoplasma gondii is another cause of HA-negative mononucleosis. Its complications in the heart, in skeletal muscle and in the central nervous system are related to direct invasion by the parasite. Cellular immunity plays an important role in defense against all three agents.
Document 2 (Title: Pathology_Robbins): Clinical Features. Infectious mononucleosis classically manifests with fever, sore throat, and lymphadenitis, but atypical presentations are not unusual. Sometimes there is little or no fever and only fatigue and lymphadenopathy exist, raising the specter of lymphoma; fever of unknown origin, unassociated with lymphadenopathy or other localized findings; hepatitis that is difficult to differentiate from one of the hepatotropic viral syndromes (Chapter 16); or a febrile rash resembling rubella. Ultimately, the diagnosis depends on the following, in increasing order of specificity: (1) the presence of atypical lymphocytes in the peripheral blood; (2) a positive heterophil reaction (Monospot test); and (3) a rising titer of antibodies specific for EBV antigens. In most patients, mononucleosis resolves within 4 to 6 weeks, but sometimes the fatigue lasts longer. Occasionally, one or more complications supervene. Perhaps the most common of these is hepatic dysfunction, associated with
Document 3 (Title: Lymphocytosis -- Etiology): Infectious: Viral infections: Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV): Infectious Mononucleosis (IM) is a classic example of viral infections associated with lymphocytosis. Acute IM is a disease characterized by fever, lymphadenopathy, pharyngitis, splenomegaly, and various hematologic manifestations, among which lymphocytosis is the most common and presents in up to two-thirds of cases. [1] Cytomegalovirus (CMV): CMV can cause a disease indistinguishable from EBV IM. Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV): Although chronic HIV infection resulted in lymphopenia and decreased CD4+ lymphocytes count, primary HIV infection can lead to an acute febrile mononucleosis-like illness with associated lymphocytosis. A negative heterophile test can help distinguish the two. [2] Other Viruses: Influenza, hepatitis, mumps, measles, rubella, and human T Lymphocytic virus type 1 (HTLV-1), adenovirus, to name a few. Bacterial Infections: Most of the acute bacterial infections will cause neutrophilia; however, notable exceptions include: Bartonella henselae : Bartonella henselae leads to cat scratch disease, a disease transmitted by scratch or bite from an infected cat, that leads mostly to self-limited lymphadenopathy, but can be associated with ocular or neurologic manifestations. Lymphocytes are large and atypical. Bordetella Pertussis : Pertussis is characterized by increased lymphocytes that are small with a deeply cleaved nucleus, clinical correlation is needed to differentiate from some lymphoid malignancies that might share the morphologic appearance. Other: Brucellosis, syphilis, malaria Parasitic Infections: Toxoplasma Gondii: symptomatic  toxoplasmosis occurs most commonly in immunocompromised hosts. Lymphocytosis with atypical lymphocytes is a hematologic hallmark of the disease, that can present as a mononucleosis-like illness.
