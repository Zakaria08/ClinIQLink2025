After massive aspirin ingestions (eg, more than 100 tablets), aggressive gut decontamination is advisable, including gastric lavage, repeated doses of activated charcoal, and consideration of whole bowel irrigation. Intravenous fluids are used to replace fluid losses caused by tachypnea, vomiting, and fever. For moderate intoxications, intravenous sodium bicarbonate is given to alkalinize the urine and promote salicylate excretion by trapping the salicylate in its ionized, polar form. For severe poisoning (eg, patients with severe acidosis, coma, and serum salicylate level >90\u2013100 mg/dL), emergency hemodialysis is performed to remove the salicylate more quickly and restore acid-base balance and fluid status.",

        "content": "Considering the difficulties following the administration of nitrites (or aminophenols) or cobalt-EDTA as well as the ineffectivenes of hydroxycobalamin and pyruvate, we feel that a more sensible treatment for acute cyanide intoxication is hemodialysis combined with the intravenous administration of sodium thiosulfate. The addition of hemodialysis to such a regimen is helpful in three ways. First, it removes the small extracellular reservoir of cyanide, particularly if the poison is still being absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Second, it corrects the severe lactic acidosis seen in virtually all cases of cyanide toxicity. As with most poisons death from metabolic acidosis alone is likely. Third, the removal of thiocyanate, the end product of cyanide metabolism, results in a maneuver which should decrease both tissue and plasma cyanide levels. The immediate treatment of acute cyanide intoxication is supportive, as it is with most all drugs and poisons. Gastric lavage using activated charcoal should be initiated immediately to remove any remaining cyanide in the gastrointestinal tract. Simultaneously, high flow oxygen should be administered either by nasal cannula or by endotracheal intubation. Correction of the metabolic acidosis should be instituted with bicarbonate. Immediate hemodialysis should be performed with the concomitant administration of thiosulfate. Animal studies suggest that continuous infusion of thiosulfate (12 mg/kg/hr) is more effective for treating cyanide intoxication than is bolus administration (41, 51). Bolus administration is the currently recommended form of thiosulfate therapy in humans. The Lilly kit contains a 50 ml ampule of thiosulfate having 12.5 gm, which in adults may be repeated once at one-half the dose.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "content": "Proper management of airway, breathing, and circulation is critical in cases of TCA poisoning. Gastrointestinal decontamination by activated charcoal should be done only if conditions are appropriate and the airway is protected. Charcoal decontamination may be effective up to 2 hours\u2019 post-ingestion, especially if the bowel sounds are diminished. Every effort should be made to minimize the formation of acidosis, as acidosis may increase cardiac and neurologic toxicity. Seizures usually respond to benzodiazepines, but in cases of refractory seizures, prompt administration of anticonvulsants, such as phenobarbital or propofol, or even general anesthesia, should be considered. Sodium bicarbonate should be given to hemodynamically unstable patients, patients with seizures, and patients with QRS prolongation of more than 100 msec. Sodium bicarbonate is given as a bolus of 1 meq/kg, followed by an intravenous infusion containing sodium bicarbonate. The aim of this therapy is to narrow the QRS and to keep the serum pH between 7.5 and 7.55. Hypotensive patients should be treated with IV fluids and sodium bicarbonate, and if their hypotension does not respond to this, alpha-adrenergic agents, such as norepinephrine, should be used. Sodium bicarbonate should be used to treat dysrhythmias associated with QRS widening. Temporary pacemakers have been used to treat refractory symptomatic bradycardias not responsive to sodium bicarbonate. Physostigmine, Type 1A, Type 1C, and Type 3 Anti-dysrhythmic agents should be strictly avoided, as should Flumazenil. Intralipid emulsion treatment should be considered in hemodynamically unstable patients with overdoses of lipophilic TCAs. Since TCA are highly protein bound with an extensive volume of distribution, enhanced elimination with dialysis and hemoperfusion is not effective.",
