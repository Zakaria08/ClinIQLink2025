Document 1 (Title: A Review of Hereditary Colorectal Cancers -- Etiology -- High-Penetrance Genetic Syndromes): Hamartomatous polyps in the small bowel are usually diagnosed with small-bowel capsule endoscopy or double-balloon enteroscopy. Double-balloon enteroscopy also enables therapeutic interventions, such as polypectomy. These lesions may lead to several complications, such as bleeding, obstruction, and intussusception. The risk of colorectal, gastric, small bowel, and pancreatic cancers is elevated, [37] [38] with the incidence of cancer rising significantly after age 50. [39] Screening for pancreatic cancer using endoscopic ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography is recommended in adults. [40] The diagnosis is established based on the following criteria: [41]
Document 2 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Push enteroscopy is performed with a long endoscope similar in design to an upper endoscope. The enteroscope is pushed down the small bowel, sometimes with the help of a stiffening overtube that extends from the mouth to the small intestine. The proximal to mid-jejunum is usually reached, and the instrument channel of the endoscope allows for biopsy or endoscopic therapy. Deeper insertion into the small bowel can be accomplished by single-or double-balloon enteroscopy or spiral enteroscopy (Fig. 345-9). These instruments enable pleating of the small intestine onto an over-tube (see Video 346e-1). With balloon-assisted enteroscopy, the entire intestinal tract can be visualized in some patients when both the oral and anal routes of insertion are used. Biopsies and endoscopic therapy can be performed throughout the visualized small bowel (Fig. 345-10).
Document 3 (Title: Double-balloon enteroscopy): The double-balloon enteroscope can also be passed in retrograde fashion, through the colon and into the ileum to visualize the end of the small bowel. Indications Double-balloon enteroscopy has found a niche application in the following settings: Bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract of obscure cause Iron deficiency anemia with normal colonoscopy and gastroscopy Visualization and therapeutic intervention on abnormalities seen on traditional small bowel imaging Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in post-surgical patients with long afferent limbs Advantages and disadvantages
