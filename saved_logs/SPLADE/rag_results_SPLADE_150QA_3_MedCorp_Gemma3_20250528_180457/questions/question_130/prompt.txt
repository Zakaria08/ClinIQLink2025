Document 1 (Title: Enzyme): The rate of a reaction is dependent on the activation energy needed to form the transition state which then decays into products. Enzymes increase reaction rates by lowering the energy of the transition state. First, binding forms a low energy enzyme-substrate complex (ES). Second, the enzyme stabilises the transition state such that it requires less energy to achieve compared to the uncatalyzed reaction (ES‡). Finally the enzyme-product complex (EP) dissociates to release the products. Enzymes can couple two or more reactions, so that a thermodynamically favorable reaction can be used to "drive" a thermodynamically unfavourable one so that the combined energy of the products is lower than the substrates. For example, the hydrolysis of ATP is often used to drive other chemical reactions. Kinetics
Document 2 (Title: Membrane phospholipids and the dark side of vision.): The key step in the visual pigment regeneration process is an enzyme-catalyzed trans to cis retinoid isomerization reaction. This reaction is of substantial general interest, because it requires the input of metabolic energy. The energy is needed because the 11-cis-retinoid reaction products are approximately 4 kcal/mol higher in energy than their all-trans congeners. In the retinal pigment epithelium a novel enzymatic system has been discovered which is capable of converting all-trans-retinol into all-trans retinyl esters, by means of a lecithin retinol acyl transferase (LRAT), followed by the direct processing of the ester into 11-cis-retinol. In this process the free energy of hydrolysis of a retinyl ester, estimated to be approximately -5 kcal/mol, is coupled to the endothermic (+4 kcal/mol) isomerization reaction, resulting in an overall exothermic process. The overall process is analogous to ATP-dependent group transfer reactions, but here the energy is provided by the membrane phospholipids. This process illustrates a new role for membranes: they can serve as an energy source.
Document 3 (Title: Cell_Biology_Alberts): Thus, it is claimed that enzymes like acetylcholinesterase and1 liter/mmole fumarase are “perfect enzymes,” each enzyme having evolved to the point where nearly every collision with its substrate converts the substrate to a product. [S] Km Figure 3–47 enzymatic acceleration of chemical reactions by decreasing the activation energy. There is a single transition state in this example. However, often both the uncatalyzed reaction (A) and the enzyme-catalyzed reaction (B) go through a series of transition states. In that case, it is the transition state with the highest energy (ST and EST) that determines the activation energy and limits the rate of the reaction. (S = substrate; P = product of the reaction; ES = enzyme–substrate complex; EP = enzyme– product complex.) Because this tight binding greatly lowers the energy of the transition state, the enzyme greatly accelerates a particular reaction by lowering the activation energy that is required (Figure 3–47).
