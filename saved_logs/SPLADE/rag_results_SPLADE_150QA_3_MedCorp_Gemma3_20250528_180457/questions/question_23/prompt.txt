Document 1 (Title: [i(17q) appearing in acute phase in Ph1-negative, BCR-negative CML].): A 36-year-old woman was referred to our hospital because of splenomegaly in February 1989. The leukocyte count was 55,500/microliter without hiatus leukemicus. The leukocyte alkaline phosphatase score was low (29). The bone marrow showed myeloid hyperplasia (24.8% myeloblasts) but no dysplastic change. The karyotype of the bone marrow cells was 46, XX and a diagnosis of Ph1 (-) CML was made. Treatment with VCR, 6MP and prednisolone made 7-month duration chronic phase, but the abnormal karyotype.[46, XX, i(17q)] gradually increased to 100% of bone marrow cells. The patient died in June 1990. The evidence that not only a BCR rearrangement but also messages of BCR/ABL fusion gene were negative made us able to differentiate this case from Ph1(-), BCR(+) CML. The addition of an i(17q) results in partial monosomy of 17q (17q13;p53 gene) and partial trisomy of 17q (17q11.2-12;G-CSF gene). We examined the rearrangement of p53 gene and G-CSF-dependent tumor cell growth in vitro, demonstrating one allelic loss of p53 gene and independent cell growth on G-CSF respectively. It is thought that in Ph1 (-), BCR (-) CML as well as in Ph1 (+) CML, an i(17q) is related to the progression but not to the initiation of these leukemias. However the precise mechanism, including p53 gene inactivation by point mutation, is still to be elucidated.
Document 2 (Title: Leukemoid reaction): Diagnosis Conventionally, a leukocytosis exceeding 50,000 WBC/mm3 with a significant increase in early neutrophil precursors is referred to as a leukemoid reaction. The peripheral blood smear may show myelocytes, metamyelocytes, promyelocytes, and rarely myeloblasts; however, there is a mixture of early mature neutrophil precursors, in contrast to the immature forms typically seen in acute leukemia. Serum leukocyte alkaline phosphatase is normal or elevated in leukemoid reaction, but is depressed in chronic myelogenous leukemia. The bone marrow in a leukemoid reaction, if examined, may be hypercellular but is otherwise typically unremarkable.
Document 3 (Title: Pancytopenia -- Evaluation): The initial workup includes a complete blood count, along with a reticulocyte count. This will help to determine if the pancytopenia is secondary to decreased production. The mean corpuscular volume would point towards megaloblastic anemia. A peripheral blood smear can show abnormal cells such as blasts, dysplastic leukocytes, and immature cells. These abnormal cells may be related to conditions described in table 3. The diagnosis related to abnormal cells may require further investigations: Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy Cytogenetic testing (fluorescent in situ hybridization [FISH] or karyotype) of bone marrow or peripheral blood Flow cytometry of bone marrow and/or peripheral blood Molecular studies (e.g., mutation analysis, gene expression profiling) The workup should also include vitamin B12 and folate levels, liver chemistry, and lactate dehydrogenase.

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
Question: A 52-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of generalized fatigue, low-grade fever, and a 10-kg (22-lb) weight loss. Physical examination shows generalized pallor and splenomegaly. Her hemoglobin concentration is 7.5 g/dL and leukocyte count is 41,800/mm3. Leukocyte alkaline phosphatase activity is low. Peripheral blood smear shows basophilia with myelocytes and metamyelocytes. Bone marrow biopsy shows cellular hyperplasia with proliferation of immature granulocytic cells. Which of the following mechanisms is most likely responsible for this patient's condition?
Options:
A. Cytokine-independent activation of the JAK-STAT pathway
B. Loss of function of the APC gene
C. Altered expression of the retinoic acid receptor gene
D. Unregulated expression of the ABL1 gene
