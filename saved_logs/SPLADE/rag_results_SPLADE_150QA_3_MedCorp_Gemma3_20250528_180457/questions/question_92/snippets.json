        "title": "A novel endoscopic transgastric fundoplication procedure for gastroesophageal reflux: an initial animal evaluation.",
        "content": "Complications of gastroesophageal reflux are common in adults and children. A variety of surgical procedures have been successfully used to treat this condition. All current techniques require open surgery and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality, particularly in the high risk, neurologically damaged child. The authors have developed a novel method of creating a gastric fundoplication using an endoscopic transgastric approach in pigs. The procedure involves the creation of an esophageal intussusception into the stomach under direct vision with an endoscope. The gastric fundus is then plicated around the esophagus using a custom stapling device. The transgastric approach allows creation of a fundoplication, is easily performed, is potentially effective at preventing gastroesophageal reflux, and has the obvious advantages of minimally invasive surgery over open techniques of fundoplication.",

A trans-labyrinthine or retrosigmoid approach with possible endoscopic aid may be the best approach to the area surgically, and brainstem auditory evoked potentials (discussed below) can be monitored during surgery to avoid damage to auditory pathways.
