        "content": "Signs and symptoms In many people, symptoms are present for a considerable time before diagnosis. The most common clinical features of IPF include the following: Age over 50 years Dry, non-productive cough on exertion Progressive exertional dyspnea (shortness of breath with exercise) Dry, inspiratory bibasilar \"velcro-like\" crackles on auscultation (a crackling sound in the lungs during inhalation similar to Velcro being torn apart slowly, heard with a stethoscope). Clubbing of the digits, a disfigurement of the finger tips or toes (see image) Abnormal pulmonary function test results, with evidence of restriction and impaired gas exchange. Some of these features are due to chronic hypoxemia (oxygen deficiency in the blood), are not specific for IPF, and can occur in other pulmonary disorders. IPF should be considered in all patients with unexplained chronic exertional dyspnea who present with cough, inspiratory bibasilar crackles, or finger clubbing.",

She reports that she was seen for similar symptoms previously at her primary care physician\u2019s office six months ago.\u00a0At that time, she was diagnosed with acute bronchitis and treated with bronchodilators, empiric antibiotics, and a short course oral steroid taper. This management did not improve her symptoms, and she has gradually worsened over six months. She reports a 20-pound (9 kg) intentional weight loss over the past year. She denies camping, spelunking, or hunting activities. She denies any sick contacts. A brief review of systems is negative for fever, night sweats, palpitations, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, neural sensation changes, muscular changes, and increased bruising or bleeding. She admits a cough, shortness of breath, and shortness of breath on exertion.",
