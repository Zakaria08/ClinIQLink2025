        "content": "Life Cycle and Epidemiology Enterobius adult worms are ~1 cm long and dwell in the cecum. Gravid female worms migrate nocturnally into the perianal region and release up to 2000 immature eggs each. The eggs become infective within hours and are transmitted by hand-to-mouth passage. From ingested eggs, larvae hatch and mature into adults. This life cycle takes ~1 month, and adult worms survive for ~2 months. Self-infection results from perianal scratching and transport of infective eggs on the hands or under the nails to the mouth. Because of the ease of person-to-person spread, pinworm infections are common among family members.",

People from tropical climates and school-aged\u00a0children are the most vulnerable. Infection is caused by the ingestion of the pinworm eggs.

[3] Risk factors for pinworms include poor hygiene, eating after touching contaminated items and living with an individual who is identified as egg positive.",
