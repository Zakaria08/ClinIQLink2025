        "title": "[Prophylactic use of DDAVP in a patient with von Willebrand disease during labor: a case report and a review].",
        "content": "A Case of delivery in a 23-year-old woman after a prophylactic infusion of DDAVP is described. She had a life-long history of easy bruising and frequent epistaxis, with the diagnosis of vWD being made when she was 14 years old. A hemostatic examination showed a prolonged bleeding time, a moderate reduction in the factor VIII level (VIII: C) and von Willebrand Factor Antigen (vWF: Ag), decreased platelet aggregation by ristocetin, and depletion of platelet retention. In April, 1988, in the 34th week of pregnancy, she was admitted to our clinic in order to avoid abnormal bleeding during labor. On admission, the level of factor VIII, ristocetin aggregation, and platelet retention were normal, but the bleeding time remained prolonged. The diagnosis of vWD type I was made on the normal multimeric structure. The DDAVP infusion test revealed a shortening of the bleeding time and an increase in the vWF: Ag. In the 41st week of pregnancy, labor was induced, accompanied by infusion of DDAVP, she gave birth to an infant without any abnormal bleeding. Since conventional treatments with human plasma derivatives may cause complicating viral infections, we propose the infusion of DDAVP is one of the treatments to prevent the abnormal bleeding of the patient with vWD during labor.",

Oral manifestations In the case of severe deficiency, there may be spontaneous gingival bleeding, ecchymosis, and epistaxis. Symptoms of VWD include postoperative bleeding, bleeding after dental extraction, gingival bleeding, epistaxis and easy bruising. The intake of oral contraceptives as the first-line treatment for menorrhagia may lead to gingival enlargement and bleeding in women. Platelet or coagulation disorders with severely altered hemostasis can cause spontaneous gingival bleeding, as seen in conjunction with hyperplastic hyperemic gingival enlargements in leukemic patients. Deposition of hemosiderin and other blood degradation products on the tooth surfaces turning them brown can occur with continuous oral bleeding over long periods.",
