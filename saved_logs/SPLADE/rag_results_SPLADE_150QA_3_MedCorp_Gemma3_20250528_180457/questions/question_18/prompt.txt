Document 1 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): Helge Eilers, MD, & Spencer Yost, MD An elderly man with type 2 diabetes mellitus and ischemic pain in the lower extremity is scheduled for femoral-to-popliteal artery bypass surgery. He has a history of hyper-tension and coronary artery disease with symptoms of stable angina. He can walk only half a block before pain in his legs forces him to stop. He has a 50-pack-year smoking history but stopped 2 years ago. Medications include atenolol, atorvastatin, and hydrochlorothiazide. The nurse in the preoperative holding area obtains the following vital signs: temperature 36.8°C (98.2°F), blood pressure 168/100 mm Hg, heart rate 78 bpm, oxygen saturation by pulse oximeter 96% while breathing room air, and pain 5/10 in the right lower leg after walking into the hospital. What anesthetic agents will you choose for his anesthetic plan? Why? Does the choice of anesthetic make a difference?
Document 2 (Title: Pancreatitis): Signs and symptoms The most common symptoms of pancreatitis are severe upper abdominal or left upper quadrant burning pain radiating to the back, nausea, and vomiting that is worse with eating. The physical examination will vary depending on severity and presence of internal bleeding. Blood pressure may be elevated by pain or decreased by dehydration or bleeding. Heart and respiratory rates are often elevated. The abdomen is usually tender but to a lesser degree than the pain itself. As is common in abdominal disease, bowel sounds may be reduced from reflex bowel paralysis. Fever or jaundice may be present. Chronic pancreatitis can lead to diabetes or pancreatic cancer. Unexplained weight loss may occur from a lack of pancreatic enzymes hindering digestion.
Document 3 (Title: [Successful treatment of "steroid-immunosuppressant resistant" polymyositis with immunoadsorption].): We report a case of "steroid and immunosuppressant-resistant" polymyositis that was successfully treated with immunoadsorption. A 46-year-old man was admitted to Shinshu University Hospital on June 2, 1989, with the chief complaint of muscle weakness and pain. He had a 1.5-year history of frequent episodes of Raynaud's phenomenon. Five months before presentation, he noticed muscle weakness and pain in the proximal muscles of his extremities. One month after the onset of these symptoms, his body temperature increased to 38 degrees C and remained elevated until the following month. He subsequently entered a local hospital. He was found to have diminished strength in all limbs that was more marked in the proximal areas. The muscle weakness and pain progressed until the patient was no longer able to walk. Muscle biopsy of the left quadriceps femoris showed mononuclear cell infiltration in the endomyosium that was accompanied by phagocytosis and interstitial fibrosis. Based on these findings, a diagnosis of polymyositis was made. During hospitalization, the weakness continued to worsen despite pulse therapy with methylprednisolone 1000 mg per day for 3 days and the administration of prednisolone 100 mg and azathioprine 100 mg per day. The patient was transferred to our hospital for further evaluation and treatment. On physical examination, he demonstrated hair loss, soft palate aphthae, tonsillar injection, and cervical lymphadenopathy. Neurological examination revealed generalized weakness; the patient was barely able to move all of his limbs. All of the muscles in his extremities were swollen and hard, and he felt pain when they were grasped. Deep tendon reflexes were diffusely hypoactive.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
Question: A 68-year-old man comes to the physician because of recurrent episodes of nausea and abdominal discomfort for the past 4 months. The discomfort is located in the upper abdomen and sometimes occurs after eating, especially after a big meal. He has tried to go for a walk after dinner to help with digestion, but his complaints have only increased. For the past 3 weeks he has also had symptoms while climbing the stairs to his apartment. He has type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and stage 2 peripheral arterial disease. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for the past 45 years. He drinks one to two beers daily and occasionally more on weekends. His current medications include metformin, enalapril, and aspirin. He is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 126 kg (278 lb); BMI is 45 kg/m2. His temperature is 36.4°C (97.5°F), pulse is 78/min, and blood pressure is 148/86 mm Hg. On physical examination, the abdomen is soft and nontender with no organomegaly. Foot pulses are absent bilaterally. An ECG shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis?
Options:
A. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy
B. Hydrogen breath test
C. Cardiac stress test
D. Abdominal ultrasonography of the right upper quadrant
