        "title": "Listeria monocytogenes activation of human peripheral blood lymphocytes: induction of non-major histocompatibility complex-restricted cytotoxic activity and cytokine production.",
        "content": "Gram-negative bacteria have been shown to activate human natural killer (NK) cells. In this report, we show that the gram-positive bacterium Listeria monocytogenes can also activate human NK cells with regard to non-major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-restricted killing and the production of cytokines. Overnight incubation of peripheral blood mononuclear (PBM) cells or enriched NK cell populations with live or Formalin-fixed L. monocytogenes resulted in high levels of non-MHC-restricted cytotoxic activity. Listeria-stimulated non-MHC-restricted cytotoxic activity could be achieved with pathogenic as well as nonpathogenic Listeria strains. PBM cells also produced tumor necrosis factor alpha and different interferons (IFNs) after incubation with Listeria strains. Optimal cytokine production appeared to be dependent on nylon wool- and plastic-adherent cells. Different IFNs were produced by Listeria-stimulated PBM cells obtained from different donors. IFN-gamma was always produced but was sometimes associated with IFN-alpha and/or IFN-beta. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) activity was never detected in culture supernatants obtained from Listeria-stimulated PBM cell cultures. However, IL-2 appeared to be produced by Listeria-stimulated PBM cells, since antibody to IL-2 inhibited Listeria-stimulated NK cell cytotoxic activity. Listeria activation of NK cell cytotoxic activity was also dependent on tumor necrosis factor alpha production. Antibody to IFN-gamma, IFN-beta, or IFN-alpha had no effect on Listeria-stimulated NK cell cytotoxic activity. These results demonstrate that NK cells can be activated by Listeria strains and add further evidence that NK cells may play an important role in host defense against bacterial infections.",

        "content": "Examples Some notable mesophiles include Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli. Other examples of species of mesophiles are Clostridium kluyveri, Pseudomonas maltophilia, Thiobacillus novellus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Different types of diseases and infections typically have pathogens from mesophilic bacteria such as the ones listed above. Listeria monocytogenes Listeria monocytogenes is a gram-positive bacterium. It is closely related to Bacillus and Staphylococcus. It is a rod-shaped, facultative anaerobe that is motile by peritrichous flagella. L. monocytogenes motility is limited from 20 \u00b0C to 25 \u00b0C. At the optimal temperature, it loses its motility. This bacterium is responsible for listeriosis which derives from contaminated food.",
