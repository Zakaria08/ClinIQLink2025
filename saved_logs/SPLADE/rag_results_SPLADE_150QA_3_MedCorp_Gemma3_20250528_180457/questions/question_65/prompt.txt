Document 1 (Title: Shortness of breath): Palliative medicine Systemic immediate release opioids are beneficial in emergently reducing the symptom of shortness of breath due to both cancer and non cancer causes; long-acting/sustained-release opioids are also used to prevent/continue treatment of dyspnea in palliative setting. There is a lack of evidence to recommend midazolam, nebulised opioids, the use of gas mixtures, or cognitive-behavioral therapy. Non-pharmacological techniques Non-pharmacological interventions provide key tools for the management of breathlessness. Potentially beneficial approaches include active management of psychosocial issues (anxiety, depression, etc.), and implementation of self-management strategies, such as physical and mental relaxation techniques, pacing techniques, energy conservation techniques, learning exercises to control breathing, and education. The use of a fan may also be beneficial. Cognitive behavioural therapy may also be helpful.
Document 2 (Title: The Importance of Cultural Competence in Pain and Palliative Care -- Introduction): Palliative care, focusing on symptom control and comfort measures, relieves suffering in patients with life-threatening illnesses and maximizes their quality of life. Palliative care may be necessary for patients diagnosed with cancer, degenerative neurologic diseases, painful neurologic diseases, and those diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease to relieve symptoms of breathlessness. Hospice or end-of-life palliative care is often provided to dying patients, particularly during the final months of life.
Document 3 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): lymph node involvement. Systemic chemotherapy and radiation therapy are indicated in the treatment of grossly involved internal mammary lymph nodes.Distant Metastases (Stage IV)Treatment for stage IV breast cancer is not curative but may prolong survival and enhance a woman’s quality of life.266 Endocrine therapies that are associated with minimal toxicity are preferred to cytotoxic chemotherapy in ER-positive disease. Appropriate candidates for initial endocrine therapy include women with hormone receptor-positive cancers who do not have immediately life threatening disease (or “visceral crisis”). This includes not only women with bone or soft tissue metastases but also women with limited visceral metastases. Symptoms per se (e.g., breathlessness) are not in themselves an indication for chemotherapy. For example, breathlessness due to a pleural effusion can be treated with percutaneous drainage, and if the breathlessness is relieved, the patient should be commenced on endocrine
