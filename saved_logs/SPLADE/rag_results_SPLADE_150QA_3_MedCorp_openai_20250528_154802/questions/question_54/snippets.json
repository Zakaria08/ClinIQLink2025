        "content": "The \"pull\" technique is most commonly used and was initially introduced by Gauderer et al. A string is attached to a needle and inserted via the abdominal wall into the stomach. It is grasped with endoscopic biopsy forceps or a snare, and then the endoscope is retracted, taking out the string through the esophagus and mouth. Then the string is attached to the external end of the PEG tube, and the string is pulled back through the abdominal wall. This results in pulling the tube from the mouth to the esophagus, the stomach, and then outside the body through the abdominal wall. [9]",

        "title": "Anterior perineal approach and three-flap anoplasty for imperforate anus: optimal reconstruction with minimal destruction.",
        "content": "Despite progress in the treatment of imperforate anus, anal stenosis, rectal prolapse, and other late complications may still arise. In 1987, we described the three-flap anoplasty for the treatment of rectal prolapse following pull-through operations. Since 1986, we have performed 14 three-flap anoplasties in combination with an anterior perineal rectal pull-through for primary treatment of imperforate anus. The mean age at definitive repair was 4.4 months (range, 0 to 14 months). Eleven of the 14 primary pull-through procedures could be performed through a perineal approach only. There were no deaths. At a mean follow-up of 24.2 months, none of the patients has developed prolapse, and only one has had a temporary stenosis. Three children are already fully continent, and soiling is absent in 12. All have a good sphincter tone. Although it is too early to evaluate long-term results, it appears that the three-flap anoplasty prevents mucosal prolapse through the interposition of a skin-lined anal canal. Moreover, a combination of this technique with the anterior perineal approach provides an excellent exposure with minimal dissection of the perineal and pelvic musculature and allows for easy and safe pull-through of the rectal pouch, making an abdominal counterincision unnecessary in most cases. It reproduces at the same time a normal anatomy while taking advantage of all existing structures.",

        "content": "Trichotillomania (TTM), also known as hair-pulling disorder or compulsive hair pulling, is a mental disorder characterized by a long-term urge that results in the pulling out of one's own hair. This occurs to such a degree that hair loss can be seen. A brief positive feeling may occur as hair is removed. Efforts to stop pulling hair typically fail. Hair removal may occur anywhere; however, the head and around the eyes are most common. The hair pulling is to such a degree that it results in distress. The disorder may run in families. It occurs more commonly in those with obsessive compulsive disorder. Episodes of pulling may be triggered by anxiety. People usually acknowledge that they pull their hair, and broken hairs may be seen on examination. Other conditions that may present similarly include body dysmorphic disorder; however, in that condition people remove hair to try to improve what they see as a problem in how they look.",
