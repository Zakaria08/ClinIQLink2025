With your own knowledge and the help of the following document:

Document 1 (Title: Cancer Chemotherapy -- Function -- Antimetabolites): MOA: reduces folate, which is essential in the synthesis of purine nucleotides and thymidylate Indications: Methotrexate for ALL, NHL, CNS, sarcoma, and pemetrexed for malignant pleural mesothelioma, NSCLC (non-squamous) Toxicity: Myelosuppression, mucositis, hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, cutaneous reactions Toxicity prevention: Hydration and alkalization of the urine, leucovorin rescue C) Purine analogs – cladribine, clofarabine, nelarabine MOA: structural analogs of guanine and act as false metabolites Indications: Cladribine for hairy cell leukemia, AML, CLL, NHL. Clofarabine for ALL, AML. Fludarabine for CLL, AML, NHL, and BMT conditioning agents. Nelarabine for T-ALL, lymphoma. Pentostatin is used for hairy cell leukemia, CTCL, and CLL. Toxicities: Myelosuppression immunosuppression (suppress CD4+ cells) puts patients at risk for opportunistic infections D) Pyrimidine analogs – fluorouracil (5-FU), capecitabine (prodrug of 5-FU).
Document 2 (Title: Methotrexate): Mechanism of action Methotrexate is an antimetabolite of the antifolate type. It is thought to affect cancer and rheumatoid arthritis by two different pathways. For cancer, methotrexate competitively inhibits dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), an enzyme that participates in the tetrahydrofolate synthesis. The affinity of methotrexate for DHFR is about 1000-fold that of folate. DHFR catalyses the conversion of dihydrofolate to the active tetrahydrofolate. Folic acid is needed for the de novo synthesis of the nucleoside thymidine, required for DNA synthesis. Also, folate is essential for purine and pyrimidine base biosynthesis, so synthesis will be inhibited. Methotrexate, therefore, inhibits the synthesis of DNA, RNA, thymidylates, and proteins.
Document 3 (Title: Biochemistry_Lippinco): 28.2, p. 378), an enzyme that is inhibited by folate analogs such as methotrexate. By decreasing the supply of THF, these drugs not only inhibit purine synthesis (see Fig. 22.7), but, by preventing methylation of dUMP to dTMP, they also decrease the availability of this essential component of DNA. DNA synthesis is inhibited and cell growth slowed. Thus, these drugs are used to treat cancer. [Note: Acyclovir (a purine analog) and AZT (3′-azido-3′-deoxythymidine, a pyrimidine analog) are used to treat infections of herpes simplex virus and human immunodeficiency virus, respectively. Each inhibits the viral DNA polymerase.] F. Pyrimidine salvage and degradation
