Document 1 (Title: Psichiatry_DSM-5): Exact prevalence and incidence of sexual dysfunctions among users of nonpsychiatric medications such as cardiovascular, cytotoxic, gastrointestinal, and hormonal agents are unknown. Elevated rates of sexual dysfunction have been reported with methadone or high-dose opioid drugs for pain. There are increased rates of decreased sexual desire, erec- tile dysfunction, and difficulty reaching orgasm associated with illicit substance use. The prevalence of sexual problems appears related to chronic drug abuse and appears higher amphetamines or 3,4—methylenedioxymethamphetamine (i.e., MDMA, ecstasy). Elevated rates of sexual dysfunction are also seen in individuals receiving methadone but are sel- dom reported by patients receiving buprenorphine. Chronic alcohol abuse and chronic nicotine abuse are related to higher rates of erectile problems.
Document 2 (Title: Chronic pain): Dysfunctional dopamine management in the brain could potentially act as a shared mechanism between chronic pain, insomnia and major depressive disorder. Astrocytes, microglia, and Satellite glial cells have also been found to be dysfunctional in chronic pain. Increased activity of microglia, alterations of microglial networks, and increased production of chemokines and cytokines by microglia might aggravate chronic pain. Astrocytes have been observed to lose their ability to regulate the excitability of neurons, increasing spontaneous neural activity in pain circuits. Management
Document 3 (Title: Examination, diagnosis and treatment of occlusal pain-dysfunction.): The complaint of chronic oro-facial pain is common, and this often presents as a frsutrating diagnostic problem. Conventional efforts at dental management of chronic pain-dysfunction in the occlusal components, tend to be unrewarding when the tissue degeneration is advanced. However, early treatment and prevention of the signs and symptoms are in the realm of every-day general practice.
