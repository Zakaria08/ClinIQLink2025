        "title": "Recruiting family physicians as participants in research.",
        "content": "Obtaining the voluntary participation of family physicians in quality of care research is a major problem in family practice research. An innovative approach was therefore required to recruit 120 randomly selected family physicians in southern Ontario in a quality of care study by the College of Family Physicians of Canada. A network of physician recruiters oriented to the study was organized for each district. This recruitment method resulted in an 84.5% participation rate. The relationship of these physician recruiters to the candidate and the method of approach were important factors in the enrolment process: the highest participation rate (95%) was obtained when the recruiters were friends of the candidate and when a personal meeting was arranged (91%). Recruiters were given an information package to help them in the recruitment process and rated the most useful items as follows: a policy statement about confidentiality, a description of the study and reprints of a published feasibility study. These results illustrate that cooperation in research in family physicians' offices can become a reality.",

        "content": "Informed consent is a legal process in which a recruit is instructed about key facts before deciding whether to participate. Researchers explain the details of the study in terms the subject can understand. The information is presented in the subject's native language. Generally, children cannot autonomously provide informed consent, but depending on their age and other factors, may be required to provide informed assent. Statistical power In any clinical trial, the number of subjects, also called the sample size, has a large impact on the ability to reliably detect and measure the effects of the intervention. This ability is described as its \"power\", which must be calculated before initiating a study to figure out if the study is worth its costs. In general, a larger sample size increases the statistical power, also the cost.",
