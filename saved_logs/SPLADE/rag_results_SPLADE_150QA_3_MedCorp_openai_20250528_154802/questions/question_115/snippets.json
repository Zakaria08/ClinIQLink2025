Its use significantly prevents the absorption of many toxic drugs and other poisons if given early post-ingestion.

        "content": "Hemoperfusion with coated activated charcoal is a novel procedure for treating acute poisoning. It enables the elimination of both, water-soluble and liposoluble toxins. Hemoperfusion with coated activated charcoal has proved to be superior to hemodialysis in the treatment of barbiturate or bromocarbamide poisoning both under experimental conditions as well as in the ward. Analogous statements may be made for the therapy of glutethimide poisoning. Methaqualone, on the other hand, could not be eliminated sufficiently well in animal trials. Intoxications by \"mild\" analgetics, such as paracetamol and acetylsalicylic acid, may be treated successfully with hemoperfusion. Treatment of acetylsalicylic acid poisoning is equally effective with hemoperfusion as with hemodialysis. Prospects for the success of hemoperfusion in treating intoxication from tricyclic antidepressants and neuroliptics are slight. It is simply the danger of antidepressant poisoning that justifies using this method of treatment in the first few hours after ingestion in order to reduced the flow of the psychopharmaceutical substance into the tissue.",

        "content": "Treatment There is no known antidote for pennyroyal toxicity. Case studies involving pennyroyal poisonings have reported the use of gastric lavages and administration of emetics or vomiting inducing agents, or absorbents like activated charcoal. As glutathione depletion has been shown to regulate liver toxification, administration of N-acetylcysteine in similar doses as given for acetaminophen toxicity have been given to patients. A study testing pulegone toxicity found inhibitors of cytochrome P450, such as cobaltous chloride or piperonyl butoxide, blocked toxicity. Such testing has not been expanded to humans, however, as the pennyroyal mechanism of toxicity is still not entirely understood.
