Document 1 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): A 21-year-old woman comes with her parents to discuss therapeutic options for her Crohn’s disease. She was diag-nosed with Crohn’s disease 2 years ago, and it involves her terminal ileum and proximal colon, as confirmed by colonoscopy and small bowel radiography. She was initially treated with mesalamine and budesonide with good response, but over the last 2 months, she has had a relapse of her symptoms. She is experiencing fatigue, cramping, abdominal pains, and nonbloody diarrhea up to 10 times daily, and she has had a 15-lb weight loss. She has no other significant medical or surgical his-tory. Her current medications are mesalamine 2.4 g/d and budesonide 9 mg/d. She appears thin and tired. Abdominal examination reveals tenderness without guarding in the right lower quadrant; no masses are palpable. On perianal examination, there is no tenderness, fissure, or fistula. Her laboratory data are notable for anemia and elevated C-reactive protein. What are the options for immediate
Document 2 (Title: [Recovery of Chlamydia pneumoniae and Chlamydia trachomatis in a patient with recurrent tonsillitis, bronchitis and otitis media with effusion].): We report a case of recurrent tonsillitis and otitis media with effusion (OME) from which Chlamydia trachomatis was isolated. Chlamydia pneumoniae, a newly recognized species of Chlamydia, was also recovered from the tonsillar and bronchial swabs. A 8-year-old girl was seen on February 23, 1988, because of a running nose, a productive cough and bilateral hearing difficulty. She had a history of recurrent tonsillitis. The diagnosis was acute sinusitis with tubal obstruction, then cefixime was prescribed. Her symptoms were once resolved, for the time being but she came back to the hospital a week later with a bilateral ear-ache. The tympanic membranes were injected and characteristically retracted. Her left ear showed type B tympanogram (effusion). Tympanocentesis was performed to remove middle-ear effusion, from which C. trachomatis but no ordinary bacterium was isolated. Therefore rokitamycin 300 mg/day was administered for a week. Her condition improved, however, a rhinorrhea, a plugged ear sensation and a hacking cough returned in a month. She was admitted to the hospital on May 10, for tympanostomy and grommet insertion, but from the day before admission, she had a sore throat with fever (39.2 degrees C). The surgery was withheld until May 26. When adenotonsillectomy and grommets insertion were undertaken, C. trachomatis had disappeared from the middle-ear effusion, but C. pneumoniae was recovered from both tonsillar and bronchial swabs. Readministration of rokitamycin was performed and to date (June, 1990) she remains well.
Document 3 (Title: Management of HIV/AIDS): Classes of medication There are six classes of drugs, which are usually used in combination, to treat HIV infection. Antiretroviral (ARV) drugs are broadly classified by the phase of the retrovirus life-cycle that the drug inhibits. Typical combinations include two nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) as a "backbone" along with one non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), protease inhibitor (PI) or integrase inhibitors (also known as integrase nuclear strand transfer inhibitors or INSTIs) as a "base."

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
Question: A 66-year-old woman with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is brought to the emergency department because of fever, body aches, malaise, and a dry cough. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 30 years but quit smoking 1 year ago. She lives with her daughter and her granddaughter, who attends daycare. Her temperature is 38.1°C (101°F). Physical examination shows bilateral conjunctivitis, rhinorrhea, and erythematous tonsils without exudates. Further testing confirms infection with an enveloped orthomyxovirus. Administration of a drug with which of the following mechanisms of action is most appropriate?
Options:
A. Inhibition of nucleoside reverse transcriptase
B. Inhibition of proton translocation
C. Inhibition of neuraminidase
D. Inhibition of protease
