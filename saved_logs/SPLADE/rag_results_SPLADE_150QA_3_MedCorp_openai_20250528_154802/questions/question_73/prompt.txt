Document 1 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Nomograms To better assess risk and guide treatment selection, many groups have developed prognostic models or nomograms that use a combination of the initial clinical T stage, biopsy Gleason score, and baseline PSA. Some use discrete cut points (PSA <10 or ≥10 ng/mL; Gleason score of ≤6, 7, or ≥8); others employ nomograms that use PSA and Gleason score as continuous variables. More than 100 nomograms have been reported to predict the probability that a clinically significant prostate cancer is present, disease extent (organ-confined vs non–organ-confined, node-negative or -positive), or the probability of success of treatment for specific local therapies using pretreatment variables. Considerable controversy exists over what constitutes “high risk” based on a predicted probability of success or failure. In these situations, nomograms and predictive models can only go so far. Exactly what probability of success or failure would lead a physician to recommend and a patient to seek
Document 2 (Title: Prostate cancer): The D'Amico classification stratifies men by low, intermediate, or high risk based on stage, grade and PSA. It is used widely in clinical practice and research settings. The major downside to the three-level system is that it does not account for multiple adverse parameters (e.g., high Gleason score and high PSA) in stratifying patients. The Partin tables predict pathologic outcomes (margin status, extraprostatic extension, and seminal vesicle invasion) based on the same three variables and are published as lookup tables. The Kattan nomograms predict recurrence after surgery and/or radiation therapy, based on data available at the time of diagnosis or after surgery. The Kattan score represents the likelihood of remaining free of disease at a given time interval following treatment.
Document 3 (Title: The use of prostate specific antigen density to enhance the predictive value of intermediate levels of serum prostate specific antigen.): Prostate specific antigen (PSA) is an extremely valuable tumor marker. However, its use in detection is limited by its low positive and negative predictive values. The ability of serum PSA to distinguish between benign and malignant prostatic conditions is particularly poor in the intermediate range of 4.1 and 10 ng./ml. by the Hybritech assay. We used transrectal ultrasound determined prostate volumes in a well characterized population of 533 men to form a serum PSA/prostate volume ratio called prostate specific antigen density (PSAD). The prevalence of cancer in the entire population was 18.4%. Discriminant analysis according to negative or positive outcome allowed for the construction of nomograms, which resulted in a PSAD defined cancer risk ranging from 3 to 100%. Predictive value nomograms created from PSAD may allow for a more individualized approach to evaluation of patients with intermediate levels of Hybritech serum PSA.
