Document 1 (Title: Pathology_Robbins): Despite impressive advances in our understanding and treatment of HIV infection, the long-term prognosis of patients with AIDS remains a concern. Although with effective drug therapy the mortality rate has declined in the United States, the treated patients still carry viral DNA in their lymphoid tissues. Truly curative therapy remains elusive. Similarly, although considerable effort has been mounted to develop a protective vaccine, many hurdles remain before this becomes a reality. Molecular analyses have revealed an alarming degree of variation in viral isolates from patients; this renders the task of producing a vaccine extremely difficult. Recent efforts have focused on producing broadly neutralizing antibodies against relatively invariant portions of HIV proteins. At present, therefore, prevention, public health measures, and anti-retroviral drugs remain the mainstays in the fight against AIDS. Progression of disease. HIVinfectionprogressesthroughphases.
Document 2 (Title: Expansion of a suppressor T-cell population associated with the hyper-IgM syndrome and generalized lymphadenopathy.): Immunoglobulin deficiency with increased IgM (hyper-IgM recurrent infection syndrome) is thought to be due to a defect of IgM/IgG isotype switching in B cells. Considerable genetic heterogeneity (X-linked, autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive inheritance, acquired forms) exists. We describe a case of hyper-IgM syndrome associated with massive lymphadenopathy in a 10-year-old girl with normal B-cell function. Absolute and relative increases of T-suppressor cells (CD8+) and a decrease of circulating CD4+ ("helper") cells were observed. The CD4+ cells present were all of the CD45R+ subtype, representing relatively immature ("naive") helper cells. In contrast, the number of CD4+ cells within the lymph nodes was increased. When tested fractionally, the patient's CD8+ cells selectively inhibited synthesis of IgG and IgA by normal B cells, but spared IgM. Normal allogenic T cells could induce IgG and IgA production by the patient's B cells. These findings suggest (a) a state of selective suppression of IgG and IgA synthesis with exclusive production of IgM, and (b) an abnormal recirculation of immature T-helper cells. This case represents a variant of this heterogeneous syndrome resembling the findings in neonatal lymphocytes and can be distinguished from the "adult" form of hyper-IgM syndrome which may be due to defective switch T cells.
Document 3 (Title: X-Linked Agammaglobulinemia -- Evaluation): A typical diagnostic test sequence would evaluate serum levels of IgG, IgM, and IgA, the number of CD19-positive or CD20-positive B cells in circulation, humoral vaccine responses, BTK protein expression in peripheral monocytes, and Btk gene sequencing. Test results consistent with a diagnosis of XLA in a male patient with a history of recurrent bacterial infections would include finding: Serum levels of IgG, IgM, and IgA that are more than two standard deviations below age-matched controls Absence of mature B lymphocytes in the peripheral circulation (i.e., fewer than 1-2%) Little or no increase in antibody titers 3-4 weeks after protein- or polysaccharide antigen vaccines (e.g., immunizing against pneumococcal pneumonia or diphtheria-tetanus) Low or absent BTK protein or mRNA expression levels Detection of disease-causing mutations in the Btk gene

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
Question: A 6-year-old male who recently immigrated to the United States from Asia is admitted to the hospital with dyspnea. Physical exam reveals a gray pseudomembrane in the patient's oropharynx along with lymphadenopathy. The patient develops myocarditis and expires on hospital day 5. Which of the following would have prevented this patient's presentation and decline?
Options:
A. Increased CD4+ T cell count
B. Secretory IgA against viral proteins
C. Increased IgM preventing bacterial invasion
D. Circulating IgG against AB exotoxin
