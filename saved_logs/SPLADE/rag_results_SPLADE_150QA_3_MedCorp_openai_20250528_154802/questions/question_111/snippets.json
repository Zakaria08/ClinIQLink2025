        "content": "Phospholipase C Pathway Specific signals can trigger a sudden increase in the cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels to 500\u20131,000 nM by opening channels in the ER or the plasma membrane. The most common signaling pathway that increases cytoplasmic calcium concentration is the phospholipase C (PLC) pathway. Many cell surface receptors, including G protein-coupled receptors and receptor tyrosine kinases, activate the PLC enzyme. PLC uses hydrolysis of the membrane phospholipid PIP2 to form IP3 and diacylglycerol (DAG), two classic secondary messengers. DAG attaches to the plasma membrane and recruits protein kinase C (PKC). IP3 diffuses to the ER and is bound to the IP3 receptor. The IP3 receptor serves as a Ca2+ channel, and releases Ca2+ from the ER. The Ca2+ bind to PKC and other proteins and activate them.",

        "title": "Activation of a phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C by colony stimulating factor 1 receptor requires tyrosine phosphorylation and a guanine nucleotide-binding protein.",
        "content": "Receptor tyrosine kinases couple to multiple intracellular effector molecules that are crucial for normal cell growth and transformation. Stimulation of membrane phospholipid hydrolysis by receptor tyrosine kinases is one such pathway for generating intracellular second messengers that may be important for mitogenesis. Certain receptor tyrosine kinases tyrosine phosphorylate a phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C that hydrolyses the membrane phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. In contrast, the glycoprotein receptor for colony stimulating factor 1, a transmembrane tyrosine kinase, does not utilize this pathway, but rather stimulates the hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine. Here we show that eluates of antiphosphotyrosine affinity purified lysates of colony-stimulating factor 1-stimulated cells contain elevated levels of phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C activity. The affinity-purified activity is sensitive to tyrosine-specific T-cell phosphatase, and is detected in the membrane fraction of stimulated cells. Recovery of phospholipase C activity in the antiphosphotyrosine protein fraction is reduced by pertussis toxin pretreatment of cells. The phosphatidylcholine phospholipase C activity in isolated membranes of colony-stimulating factor 1-treated cells was also reduced by pertussis toxin treatment and stimulated by guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate. These results indicate that colony stimulating factor 1 receptor-mediated stimulation of phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C requires tyrosine phosphorylation, and might be affected by a G-protein coupled pathway.",

Detailed structures of cys-loop and glutamate ionotropic receptors are shown in C and D, respectively. Cys-loop receptors include ionotropic receptors for GABA, glycine, serotonin, and acetylcholine. Note the differing membrane topologies of the individual subunits of these two classes of receptors: four transmembrane domains for cys-loop receptors and three plus a pore loop for glutamate receptors. Pore loops form the internal wall of the glutamate channel, whereas transmembrane domain 2 forms the internal wall of cys-loop receptors. (A and B, From Purves D, Augustine GJ, Fitzpatrick D.
