Document 1 (Title: Clinical studies on canine dirofilarial hemoglobinuria: measured and calculated serum osmolalities and osmolar gap.): Serum osmolalities and osmolar gap were determined in 43 normal healthy beagles (control group) and 40 dogs with dirofilarial hemoglobinuria (hemoglobinuria group). In the control group, the measured and calculated serum osmolality levels were in the means of 296 +/- 5 (SD) mOsm/kg and 293 +/- 6 mOsm/kg respectively, showing an osmolar gap less than 10 mOsm/kg. In the hemoglobinuria group, the measured serum osmolality ranged from 272 to 370 mOsm/kg. A considerable number of dogs had normal serum osmolalities in spite of severe intravascular hemolysis, suggesting that the changes in serum osmolality would not be the direct cause of intravascular hemolysis. The measured serum osmolality (331 +/- 28 mOsm/kg) was significantly higher in 11 dogs which died after a surgical removal heartworms than in 29 dogs which recovered after the removal (302 +/- 17 mOsm/kg). The calculated serum osmolality level was 296 +/- 16 mOsm/kg in 24 recovered cases, and 304 +/- 22 mOsm/kg in 10 fatal cases. The osmolar gap stayed in the normal ranges of 5.4 +/- 5.9 mOsm/kg in recovered cases, but it attained a higher level of 22.7 +/- 8.9 mOsm/kg in fatal cases, suggesting poor prognosis in cases with large osmolar gaps. There were significant positive correlations between the measured serum osmolality and osmolar gap, serum sodium, potassium, BUN, GOT, GPT, creatinine, bilirubin and plasma hemoglobin values, as well as between the osmolar gap and serum potassium, BUN, GOT, GPT, creatinine and bilirubin values. The plasma hemoglobin concentration fell markedly without significant change in serum osmolality 20 hr after the heartworm removal.
Document 2 (Title: Physiology_Levy): Equation 1.8 Osmolarity = concentration × number of dissociable particles mOsm/L = mmol/L × number of particles The terms osmolarity and osmolality are frequently confused and incorrectly interchanged. Osmolarity refers to the osmotic pressure generated by the dissolved solute molecules in 1 L of solvent, whereas osmolality is the number of molecules dissolved in 1 kg of solvent. For a dilute solution, the difference between osmolarity and osmolality is cNaCl does not completely dissociate in water. The value for n is 1.88 rather than 2. However, for simplicity, the value of 2 is most often used.
Document 3 (Title: Physiology, Osmoregulation and Excretion -- Cellular Level): It is also noteworthy that there is a distinction between the terms osmolarity and osmolality. While osmolarity is the number of osmoles per liter, osmolality is the number of osmoles per kilogram. In terms of volume status, we are concerned more so with the plasma osmolality, since it is independent of temperature and pressure. However, clinically, it is much easier to express body fluid quantities in liters rather than kilograms. At low concentrations (as in the human body), these two terms are almost synonymous with each other. [5] [6]

Answer the following list question.
Question: Select the correct statement(s) regarding osmolarity and osmolality:
Options:
1. Osmolarity is the number of osmoles per liter of solution
2. Osmolality is the number of osmoles per kilogram of solvent
3. In plasma, proteins representing about 7% of the total volume, osmolality equals osmolarity divided by 0.93
4. Osmolarity and osmolality can be confused for a dilute aqueous solution
5. Plasma osmolarity is measured by cryoscopy
