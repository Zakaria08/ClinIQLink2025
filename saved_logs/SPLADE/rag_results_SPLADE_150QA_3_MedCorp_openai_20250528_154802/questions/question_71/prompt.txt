Document 1 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Clinical Manifestations and Diagnosis Epiglottitis typically presents more acutely in young children than in adolescents or adults. On presentation, most children have had symptoms for <24 h, including high fever, severe sore throat, tachycardia, systemic toxicity, and (in many cases) drooling while sitting forward. Symptoms and signs of respiratory obstruction also may be present and may progress rapidly. The somewhat milder illness in adolescents and adults often follows 1–2 days of severe sore throat and is commonly accompanied by dyspnea, drooling, and stridor. Physical examination of patients with acute epiglottitis may reveal moderate or severe respiratory distress, with inspiratory stridor and retractions of the chest wall. These findings diminish as the disease progresses and the patient tires. Conversely, oropharyngeal examination reveals infection that is much less severe than would be predicted from the symptoms—a finding that should alert the clinician to a cause of
Document 2 (Title: Neonatal MIS-C -- Introduction): World Health Organization declared a COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. SARS-CoV-2 causes COVID-19 infection. It presents as acute respiratory distress syndrome and infects all age groups. In adults, COVID-19 causes acute respiratory failure. In children, COVID-19 usually has a milder clinical course and more favorable outcome than in adults. In contrast to adults and older children, covid-19 infection is uncommon in neonates. [1]
Document 3 (Title: [A clinical score system for children with ARDS].): In a retrospective study we developed a simple acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) scoring system in order to analyze the severity of ARDS as precisely as possible. From March 1983 to May 1990, 17 children with ARDS were admitted and treated at the pediatric intensive care unit of the University Hospital of Graz. The ARDS score was evaluated as a predictor of outcome. The score is based on four variables: mean airway pressure, oxygenation index, additional number of organ system failure and a radiological score, each of which was assigned a score between 0 and 3 (Table 3). The score was recorded on admission or immediately after respiratory failure and after 24, 48 and 72 h. The patients were divided into survivors and non-survivors. After 24 h of mechanical ventilation the ARDS score was 7.16 +/- 0.79 in survivors and 10.4 +/- 0.4 points in non-survivors (P less than 0.0006). Similar differences were found after 48 and 72 h of therapy. In addition, the predictive power of the ARDS score after 24 h was tested at a level of 8 points. The sensitivity and the positive predictive value were 90%, while specificity and negative predictive value were 85.7%. The correct prediction was 88.2%. We conclude that this simple ARDS score can be an useful prognostic factor in patients with ARDS.
