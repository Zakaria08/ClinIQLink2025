Document 1 (Title: Pathology_Robbins): Fig. 6.3 ), just as well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinomas secrete bile. In other instances, unanticipated functions emerge. Some cancers may express fetal proteins not produced by comparable cells in the adult. Cancers of nonendocrine origin may produce so-called “ectopic hormones.” For example, certain lung carcinomas may produce adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), parathyroid hormone– like hormone, insulin, glucagon, and others. More is said about these so-called “paraneoplastic” phenomena later. Also of relevance in the discussion of differentiation and anaplasia is dysplasia, referring to disorderly proliferation.

Document 2 (Title: Hepatocellular Carcinoma  -- Histopathology): Hepatocellular carcinoma is a malignant tumor of the hepatocytes. Cytological features depend on the differentiation of hepatocytes. From well-differentiated to poorly differentiated HCC. The trabecular architectural pattern is the commonest. Other patterns include pseudoacinar (acinar with proteinaceous material), compact and sarcomatoid. Histology may show variation, according to the differentiation of the tissue: Well-Differentiated: cells smaller than normal, minimal nuclear atypia, nuclear density two times of normal liver Moderately Differentiated: larger tumor cells with more eosinophilic cytoplasm, pseudoglands, distinct nucleoli, bile, and giant tumor cells Poorly Differentiated: large tumor cells with hyperchromatic nuclei prominent pleomorphism may have spindle cell or small-cell areas
Document 3 (Title: [Pathomorphologic study on early hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)--a study of cell density in well-differentiated HCC of the early stage].): In order to clarify the histologic characteristics of well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a comparative morphometric study on cell density was performed in 15 HCCs smaller than 2 cm in diameter, 6 HCCs with marked fatty and/or clear cell change, 7 hyperplastic nodules, 5 hyperplastic nodules containing foci of HCC, and non-cancerous areas of the livers bearing small HCC. In well-differentiated HCC, marked increase of cell density accompanying by decrease of cell size and increase of nuclear cytoplasm ratio were prominent, and the cell density was approximately two times larger than that of the non-cancerous area in most cases. In HCCs with marked fatty and/or clear cell change, as an increase of cell density was not evident because of swelling of the cytoplasm due to fat and/or glycogen accumulation, it should be careful to differentiate them from non-cancerous nodular lesions including hyperplastic nodule with marked fatty change. Hyperplastic nodules could be divided into two groups; those with marked increase of cell density, and those without increase of cell density. In the former group, 5 of the 7 nodules contained cancerous foci.
