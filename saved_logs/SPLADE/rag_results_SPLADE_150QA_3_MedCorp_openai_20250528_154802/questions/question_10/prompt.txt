With your own knowledge and the help of the following document:

Document 1 (Title: Pediatrics_Nelson): Decongestants, taken orally or intranasally, may be used to relieve nasal congestion. Oral medications, such as pseudoephedrine and phenylephrine, are available either alone or in combination with antihistamines. Adverse effects of oral decongestants include insomnia, nervousness, irritability, tachycardia, tremors, and palpitations. For older children participating in sports, oral decongestant use may be restricted. Topical nasal decongestant sprays are effective for immediate relief of nasal obstruction but should be used for less than 5 to 7 days to prevent rebound nasal congestion (rhinitis medicamentosa). Topical ipratropium bromide, an anticholinergic nasalspray, is used primarily for nonallergic rhinitis and rhinitis associated with viral upper respiratory infection. Leukotrienemodifiers have been studied in the treatment of allergic rhinitis. Montelukast is approved for use in seasonal allergicrhinitis.
Document 2 (Title: Rhinitis Medicamentosa -- Introduction): Topical decongestants are typically used in the relief of nasal congestion due to allergic rhinitis, acute or chronic rhinosinusitis, nasal polyps, or upper respiratory tract infection. The earliest nasal decongestants mainly derived from ephedrine, where there were reports of rebound congestion after prolonged use. This situation was found to develop as early as 3 days and up to 4 to 6 weeks of use. [1] However, with the emergence of modern vasoconstrictors, such as the imidazoline derivatives, the risk of developing RM is considered to be small or non-existent.
Document 3 (Title: Clinical evaluation of triamcinolone acetonide nasal aerosol in children with perennial allergic rhinitis.): Triamcinolone acetonide aerosol (TAA), a topical corticosteroid, now available for intranasal use, has been shown to be highly effective in the treatment of both seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis (PAR) in adults. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of TAA in children, 210 patients (ages 4 to 12 years) with PAR were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups (placebo, TAA 82.5 micrograms/day, or TAA 165 micrograms/day). Medication was given tid over 12 weeks in a double-blind fashion. Response to medication was evaluated using symptom scoring, physician evaluation, and, in 44 patients, nasal airflow determinations by anterior rhinomanometry. The higher dose of TAA (165 micrograms/day) significantly improved rhinitis symptoms relative to placebo: the total nasal symptom score and most individual symptom scores (eg, nasal stuffiness, itch, sneezing) were significantly better, duration of rhinitis symptoms (hours per day) was significantly reduced, and nasal airflow in a subset of patients showed significant improvement. The lower dose of TAA (82.5 micrograms/day) was superior to placebo by the same parameters as the higher dose, but this improvement was not as consistently significant as the higher dose. There were no clinically significant adverse events; nasal irritation and epistaxis were rare with a similar incidence among treatment groups. In conclusion, TAA at 165 micrograms/day was effective in controlling the symptoms of PAR and in improving nasal airflow in pediatric patients; the lower dose (82.5 micrograms/day) was marginally effective. Both doses were safe and well-tolerated in the children studied.
