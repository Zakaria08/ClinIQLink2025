Document 1 (Title: Root Cause Analysis and Medical Error Prevention -- Function -- Case example 1): A 42-year-old primigravida woman at 34 weeks gestation was brought to the obstetric emergency department at midnight with complaints of severe headache, blurry vision, and right upper quadrant pain for the last 5 to 6 hours. She noted lower extremity edema and facial swelling that was gradually increasing. She has gestational hypertension and, 1 week ago, was prescribed labetalol 200 mg twice a day. On initial presentation, her blood pressure was 190/110 mm Hg on 2 separate occasions, 5 minutes apart. She had gained 2 kilograms since her last antenatal checkup in the clinic a week ago. The patient was diagnosed with severe preeclampsia. The senior obstetric resident ordered a loading dose of magnesium sulfate to prevent imminent seizure. The hospital protocol used an intravenous (IV) and intramuscular (IM) regimen where the patient received a 4 g IV bolus and a 10 g IM dose administered as 5 g in each buttock. The senior resident gave verbal orders for magnesium sulfate administration to the junior resident, who verbally communicated the order to the nurse.
Document 2 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): Her social history is significant for alcohol use (three to four glasses of wine/night). Her vital signs include the following: temperature 99.8°F, blood pressure 132/64 mm Hg, pulse 78 bpm, and respiratory rate 15/min. On physical examination, she had left upper abdominal tenderness with evidence of hepatomegaly and mild scleral icterus. Laboratory data revealed the following: alanine aminotransferase, 527 IU/L (normal 10–35 IU/L); aspartate aminotransferase, 425 IU/L (normal < 35 IU/L); and bilirubin, 2.9 mg/dL (normal 0.1–0.3 mg/dL). What medications do OTC cold and flu preparations typically contain? Which of the OTC medications might have contrib-uted to the patient’s current symptoms? KH, a 55-year-old woman, presents to the emergency department with nausea, vomiting, and complaints of new-onset flu symptoms over the past several days. Her past medical history is significant for allergic rhinitis and chronic lower back pain secondary to a work-related fall 2 years ago. Her
Document 3 (Title: Longitudinal chronobiologic blood pressure monitoring for assessing the need and timing of antihypertensive treatment.): To examine the need for antihypertensive therapy and its timing, a 46 year-old woman with a 10-year history of "mild to moderate hypertension," treated for that span with 50 mg of hydrochlorothiazide per day, usually taken before retiring, carried out a study in a series of stages. Throughout the first 8 stages, she monitored her blood pressure and heart rate at 15-minute intervals around the clock for 70 consecutive days. In the first two stages, her medication was continued for a total of 10 days, of which the last 7 days constituted a double-blind study start. For the next 25 days, she was placed on a placebo once in the evening. For the ensuing week, she received three tablets per day (in the morning, noon and evening), with all three being placebo. Thereafter, for consecutive 7-day spans, she was placed on treatment, only in the morning, only at noon or only in the evening, with placebo at other times. The desirability of one vs. another treatment was assessed by a comparison of slopes fitted to the daily MESORs; on that basis, the morning or noon treatment appeared to be possibly superior to the evening treatment. Eventually the patient was taken off medication; 5 months later her sphygmochrons, based on two-to-six day monitoring, were acceptable by current standards. The slope of MESORs may be a useful endpoint to assess the need for medication, to optimize its timing or to establish the likelihood that medication is not needed. This approach should, however, be based on several (rather than a single) double-blind alternation of drug and placebo treatments for spans that are the longer the smaller the extent of apparent blood pressure elevation. Thus, in the case of apparent mild MESOR-hypertension, the blood pressure MESOR changes following the change in medication should be assessed during spans longer than one week. In the particular case studied, it seems possible that the patient had taken medication for 10 years, perhaps without justification. In cases of very mild blood pressure elevation, it seems desirable, by self-measurement or preferably automatic measurement, to take the patient off medication for spans measured in weeks or preferably months rather than days, in order to rule in or rule out the need for treatment, on the basis of repeated blood pressure profiles, to be compared eventually with reference standards from peers at low familial and personal risk of developing high blood pressure.

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
Question: A 25-year-old primigravida presents to her physician for a routine prenatal visit. She is at 34 weeks gestation, as confirmed by an ultrasound examination. She has no complaints, but notes that the new shoes she bought 2 weeks ago do not fit anymore. The course of her pregnancy has been uneventful and she has been compliant with the recommended prenatal care. Her medical history is unremarkable. She has a 15-pound weight gain since the last visit 3 weeks ago. Her vital signs are as follows: blood pressure, 148/90 mm Hg; heart rate, 88/min; respiratory rate, 16/min; and temperature, 36.6℃ (97.9℉). The blood pressure on repeat assessment 4 hours later is 151/90 mm Hg. The fetal heart rate is 151/min. The physical examination is significant for 2+ pitting edema of the lower extremity. Which of the following tests o should confirm the probable condition of this patient?
Options:
A. Bilirubin assessment
B. Coagulation studies
C. Leukocyte count with differential
D. 24-hour urine protein
