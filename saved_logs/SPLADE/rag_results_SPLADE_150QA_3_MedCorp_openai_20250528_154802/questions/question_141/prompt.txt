With your own knowledge and the help of the following document:

Document 1 (Title: Polycythemia Vera -- Evaluation -- Category B): Platelets of more than 400,000/microliter White blood cell count more than 12,000/microliter Leukocyte alkaline phosphatase (ALP) more than 100 U/L Serum vitamin B12 more than 900 pg/mL or binding capacity more than 2200 pg/mL
Document 2 (Title: Familial polycythemia vera.): The occurrence of polycythemia vera in a father, mother, and two sons is reported. Thirteen kindreds with familial polycythemia vera in 31 members are reviewed. Comprehensive records were available for all four patients as well as other family members, since all were diagnosed and treated at the author's institution over a period of nearly 50 years. The mean age at diagnosis, sex predominance, symptoms, and incidence of chromosomal abnormalities, leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, and elevated leukocyte alkaline phosphatase levels were similar to those of nonfamilial cases. The mean RBC volume at diagnosis and the incidence of splenomegaly appear to be higher in familial than nonfamilial cases. The mode of inheritance is unclear, but genetic factors may be involved in the pathogenesis of this myeloproliferative disorder.
Document 3 (Title: Pathoma_Husain): Negative leukocyte alkaline phosphatase (LAP) stain (granulocytes in a leukemoid reaction are LAP positive) 2. Increased basophils (absent with leukemoid reaction) 3. III. POLYCYTHEMIA VERA (PV) A. Neoplastic proliferation of mature myeloid cells, especially RBCs 1. Granulocytes and platelets are also increased. B. Associated with JAK2 kinase mutation C. Clinical symptoms are mostly due to hyperviscosity of blood. 1. 2. Increased risk of venous thrombosis (e.g., hepatic vein, portal vein, and dural sinus) 3. Flushed face due to congestion (plethora) 4. Itching, especially after bathing (due to histamine release from increased mast cells) D. Treatment is phlebotomy; second-line therapy is hydroxyurea. Fig. 6.11 Chronic myelogenous leukemia. Fig. 6.12 Essential thrombocythemia. 1. Without treatment, death usually occurs within one year. E. PV must be distinguished from reactive polycythemia. 1. In PV, erythropoietin (EPO) levels are decreased, and Sao is normal. 2.
