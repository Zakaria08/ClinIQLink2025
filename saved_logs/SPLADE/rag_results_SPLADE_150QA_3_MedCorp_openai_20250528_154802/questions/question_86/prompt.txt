Document 1 (Title: University of Worcester): In August 2010 the university was granted research degree-awarding powers, enabling it to confer the awards of MPhil and PhD. Before this Coventry University assisted in the academic awarding of these degrees. The university includes eight national research centres: The National Pollen and Aerobiology Research Unit from where all UK national pollen forecasts originate, and testing of new hay fever and anti-allergen devices is conducted. The Centre for Rural Research, which examined the psychological effects of the mass flooding in the UK in recent years. The International Centre for Children's Literature, Literacy and Creativity is, with University of Cambridge and Roehampton University, one of the three UK university centres to employ full-time children's literature professors.
Document 2 (Title: Clinical significance of aero-allergen identification in the western Cape.): Positive identification and documentation of the seasonal variation of aero-allergens and the immune responses to them has important implications for the timing of allergen avoidance measures and the selection of patients suitable for immunotherapy. The relative abundance of aero-allergens in the Cape Peninsula during 1984-1987 was measured by continuous volumetric air sampling, using a Burkard spore trap. Mould spore counts of greater than 3,000 spores/m3 were found throughout the year and were only exceeded by pollen grains in the months of September and October (range 4,800-7,400 spores/m3). Gramineae and Compositae spores were found perennially in significant numbers. Pollen from allergenic trees peaked at fixed times each year: oak in August; plane in September and pine between August and October. Grasses found on the Peninsula include sweet vernal, Bermuda grass, rye grass, common reed, Johnson grass, brome grass, canary grass, annual meadow and kikuyu. In vivo skin tests in 209 children with known allergic disease were positive to Dermatophygoides pteronyssimus (73%), South African grasses (38%), tree pollens (22.4%), flower and weed pollens (19.6%), cat (27%), dog (12%) and feathers (18.6%). One-third of the 1,372 children screened at Red Cross War Memorial Children's Hospital Allergy Service had positive specific IgE responses to environmental allergens. Investigation of 62 children possibly allergic to grass using the radio-allergosorbent test revealed positive results in 25 (41%). Of these, 92% were positive to Timothy grass, a grass not occurring in the Cape Peninsula. Knowledge of cross-reactivity profiles for local allergens minimises the number of tests required in allergy diagnosis.
Document 3 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): ALLERGENS Inhaled allergens activate mast cells with bound IgE directly leading to the immediate release of bronchoconstrictor mediators, resulting in the early response that is reversed by bronchodilators. Often, experimental allergen challenge is followed by a late response when there is airway edema and an acute inflammatory response with increased eosinophils and neutrophils that are not very reversible with bronchodilators. The most common allergens to trigger asthma are Dermatophagoides species, and environmental exposure leads to low-grade chronic symptoms that are perennial. Other perennial allergens are derived from cats and other domestic pets, as well as cockroaches. Other allergens, including grass pollen, ragweed, tree pollen, and fungal spores, are seasonal. Pollens usually cause allergic rhinitis rather than asthma, but in thunderstorms, the pollen grains are disrupted and the particles that may be released can trigger severe asthma exacerbations (thunderstorm asthma).
