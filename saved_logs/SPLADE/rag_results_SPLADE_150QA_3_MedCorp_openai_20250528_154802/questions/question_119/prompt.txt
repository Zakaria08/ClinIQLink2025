Document 1 (Title: Cell_Biology_Alberts): Because an OH– ion combines with a H3O+ ion to form two water molecules, an increase in the OH– concentration forces a decrease in the concentration of H3O+, and vice versa. A pure solution of water contains an equal concentration (10–7 M) of both ions, rendering it neutral. The interior of a cell is also kept close to neutrality by the presence of buffers: weak acids and bases that can release or take up protons near pH 7, keeping the environment of the cell relatively constant under a variety of conditions. Figure 2–5 Protons readily move in aqueous solutions. (a) The reaction that takes place when a molecule of acetic acid dissolves in water. at ph 7, nearly all of the acetic acid is present as acetate ion. (B) Water molecules are continuously exchanging protons with each other to form hydronium and hydroxyl ions. These ions in turn rapidly recombine to form water molecules. a Cell is formed from Carbon Compounds
Document 2 (Title: Primary standard): Arsenic trioxide for making sodium arsenite solution for standardisation of sodium periodate solution (until Ph. Eur. 3, Appendix 2001 also for iodine and cerium(IV) sulfate solutions, since Ph. Eur. 4, 2002 standardised by sodium thiosulfate) Benzoic acid for standardisation of waterless basic solutions: ethanolic sodium and potassium hydroxide, TBAH, and alkali methanolates in methanol, isopropanol, or DMF Potassium bromate (KBrO3) for standardisation of sodium thiosulfate solutions Potassium hydrogen phthalate (usually called KHP) for standardisation of aqueous base and perchloric acid in acetic acid solutions Sodium carbonate for standardisation of aqueous acids: hydrochloric, sulfuric acid and nitric acid solutions (but not acetic acid) Sodium chloride for standardisation of silver nitrate solutions Sulfanilic acid for standardisation of sodium nitrite solutions Zinc powder, after being dissolved in sulfuric or hydrochloric acid, for standardization of EDTA solutions
Document 3 (Title: Studies on the derivatives of thiazole acetic acid. II. Syntheses and pharmacological analysis of 2-N-aralkylidene and 2-N-aralkyl derivatives of 2-amino-4-p-chlorophenylthiazole-5-acetic acid.): A number of 2-N-aralkylidene, 2-N-aralkyl and 2-N-aralkyl-alpha-sulphoderivatives of 2-amino-4-p-chlorophenylthiazole-5-acetic acid (I, R = H) and its methyl ester (I, R = CH3) were synthesized. As a result of condensation of methyl ester I with various aromatic aldehydes in boiling benzene solution, the Schiff-bases (anils) II--VIII were obtained. After reduction with NaBH4 compounds II--VIII were transformed into adequate amino esters IX--XV. Esters IX--XV heated with diluted aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide underwent selective hydrolysis giving the respective amino acids XVI--XXII. Some of Schiff bases (II, III, V, VII, VIII) reacted with aqueous alcoholic solution of sodium bisulphite after its several (XXIII--XXVII). alpha-sulphoderivatives had been obtained. Several tests were performed in order to detect the anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive activity of the compounds. The pharmacological analysis allowed us to draw conclusions concerning the relationship between chemical structure and biological activity in this group of compounds. The most efficacious immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory activity exhibited 2-aralkyl-alpha-sulphoderivatives.
