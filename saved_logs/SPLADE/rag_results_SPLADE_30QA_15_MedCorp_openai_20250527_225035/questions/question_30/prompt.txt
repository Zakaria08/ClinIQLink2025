Document 1 (Title: Fahr Syndrome -- History and Physical -- Clinical Features): (A) Movement disorder like features: [4] Signs and symptoms resembling parkinsonism, such as bradykinesia, rigidity, tremor, hypophonia, hypomimia, mask-like facies, shuffling gait Clumsiness Fatigability Gait dysfunction Choreoathetosis Dystonia Slurred speech Muscle cramping Pyramidal or cerebellar symptoms (rarely) (B) Neuropsychiatric features [5] Depression Apoplexia Dementia, mostly fronto-executive type resembling subcortical dementia in Wilson disease and Huntington disease Concentration deficits Behavioral changes (C) Other CNS features [6] [3] Loss of consciousness Tetany Seizures Spasticity Speech impairment Myoclonus Coma Papilledema Chronic headache Vertigo Urinary urgency or incontinence Impotence Severe hypertension
Document 2 (Title: Temporal dimensions of consonant and vowel production: an acoustic and CT scan analysis of aphasic speech.): This study explored a number of temporal (durational) parameters of consonant and vowel production in order to determine whether the speech production impairments of aphasics are the result of the same or different underlying mechanisms and in particular whether they implicate deficits that are primarily phonetic or phonological in nature. Detailed analyses of CT scan lesion data were also conducted to explore whether more specific neuroanatomical correlations could be made with speech production deficits. A series of acoustic analyses were conducted including voice-onset time, intrinsic and contrastive fricative duration, and intrinsic and contrastive vowel duration as produced by Broca's aphasics with anterior lesions (A patients), nonfluent aphasics with anterior and posterior lesions (AP patients), and fluent aphasics with posterior lesions (P patients). The constellation of impairments for the anterior aphasics including both the A and AP patients suggests that their disorder primarily reflects an inability to implement particular types of articulatory gestures or articulatory parameters rather than an inability to implement particular phonetic features. They display impairments in the implementation of laryngeal gestures for both consonant and vowel production. These patterns seem to relate to particular anatomical sites involving Broca's area, the anterior limb of the internal capsule, and the lowest motor cortex areas for larynx and tongue. The posterior patients also show evidence of subtle phonetic impairments suggesting that the neural instantiation of speech may require more extensive involvement, including the perisylvian area, than previously suggested.
Document 3 (Title: Pediatrics_Nelson): The simplest way to assess intellectual abilities is through language skills. Language function is receptive (understanding speech or gestures) and expressive (speech and use of gestures). Abnormalities of language resulting from cerebral hemisphere disorders are referred to as aphasias. Anterior, expressive, or Broca aphasia is characterized by sparse, non-fluent language. Posterior, receptive, or Wernicke aphasia is characterized by an inability to understand language, with speech that is fluent but nonsensical. Global aphasia refers to impaired expressive and receptive language. The cranial nerve evaluation assesses brainstem integrity but depends on the stage of brain maturation and the ability to cooperate. A colorful toy may capture a young child’s attention and permit observation of coordination, movement, and cranial nerve function.
Document 4 (Title: Neurology_Adams): If there is any suggestion of a speech or language disorder, the nature of the patient’s spontaneous speech should be noted. In addition, the accuracy of reading, writing, and spelling, executing spoken commands, repeating words and phrases spoken by the examiner, naming objects, and parts of objects should be assessed. The ability to carry out commanded tasks (praxis) is pertinent to the evaluation of several aspects of cortical function. For example, commonly used tests are carrying out commanded and imitated gestures such as hammering a nail, blowing out a candle, throwing dice and copying sequential hand positions. Visuospatial abilities may be tested by asking the patient to bisect a line, draw the numbers and hands of a clock face or the floor plan of one’s home or a map of one’s country, and copying figures. Recognition (gnosis) is tested by naming of objects or pictures and describing their use. Testing of Cranial Nerves
Document 5 (Title: Anomic aphasia): Anomic aphasia (also known as dysnomia, nominal aphasia, and amnesic aphasia) is a mild, fluent type of aphasia where individuals have word retrieval failures and cannot express the words they want to say (particularly nouns and verbs). Anomia is a deficit of expressive language. Anomia is a symptom of all forms of aphasia, but patients whose primary deficit is word retrieval are diagnosed with anomic aphasia. Some level of anomia is seen in all of the aphasias. Individuals with aphasia who display anomia can often describe an object in detail and maybe even use hand gestures to demonstrate how the object is used, but cannot find the appropriate word to name the object. Patients with anomic aphasia have relatively preserved speech fluency, repetition, comprehension, and grammatical speech.
Document 6 (Title: Pseudodementia): Pseudodementia (otherwise known as depression-related cognitive dysfunction) is a condition where mental cognition can be temporarily decreased. The term pseudodementia is applied to the range of functional psychiatric conditions such as depression and schizophrenia, that may mimic organic dementia, but are essentially reversible on treatment. Pseudodementia typically involves three cognitive components: memory issues, deficits in executive functioning, and deficits in speech and language. Specific cognitive symptoms might include trouble recalling words or remembering things in general, decreased attentional control and concentration, difficulty completing tasks or making decisions, decreased speed and fluency of speech, and impaired processing speed. People with pseudodementia are typically very distressed about the cognitive impairment they experience. With in this condition, there are two specific treatments that have been found to be effective for the treatment of depression, and
Document 7 (Title: Body Dysmorphic Disorder -- Pathophysiology): Subjects with BDD have a decreased ability to recognize the emotions of others through facial expressions, an emotional processing deficit. One study found that patients with BDD are likelier to misinterpret neutral facial expressions in photographs as angry. [23] Executive function may also be impaired. Specific areas of difficulty are response inhibition, planning, and decision-making. [24] [25] Deficits in executive function combined with neuroimaging findings suggest that subjects with BDD have frontal lobe dysfunction compared to healthy controls. [26]
Document 8 (Title: Alcohol-related dementia): A. The development of multiple cognitive deficits manifested by both: Memory impairment (impaired ability to learn new information or to recall previously learned information) One (or more) of the following cognitive disturbances: (a) Aphasia (language disturbance) (b) Apraxia (impaired ability to carry out motor activities despite intact motor function) (c) Agnosia (failure to recognize or identify objects despite intact sensory function) (d) Disturbance in executive functioning (i.e. planning, organizing, sequencing, abstracting) B. The cognitive deficits in criteria A1 and A2 each cause significant impairment in social or occupational functioning and represent a significant decline from a previous level of functioning. C. The deficits do not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium and persist beyond the usual duration of substance intoxication or withdrawal.
Document 9 (Title: Interaction between verbal and gestural language in progressive aphasia: a longitudinal case study.): The objective of this longitudinal study is to investigate the on-line interaction between praxis and linguistic abilities in a progressive aphasia case. During 3 years of evolution, procedural discourse of a progressive aphasic patient was videotaped five times, allowing us to analyze the progression of both language and gestural production as well as the interaction between these two. We anticipated that, in the absence of apraxia, the patient would compensate for her speech deficit by producing progressively more and more meaningful gestures. Our compensatory hypothesis was confirmed but the compensation was not as efficient as one would expect given the absence of apraxia. With the progression of the speech deficit, the patient could not replace some verbs by pantomimes that were otherwise accompanying her discourse in the preceding testing sessions. We suggest that such a compensatory ability may constitute one important characteristic of the progressive aphasia syndrome.
Document 10 (Title: Broca Aphasia -- History and Physical): Broca aphasia is non-fluent aphasia. The output of spontaneous speech is markedly diminished. There is a loss of normal grammatical structure (agrammatic speech). Specifically, small linking words, conjunctions (and, or, but), and the use of prepositions are lost. For example, a sentence like "I took the dog for a walk." may become "I walk the dog." Patients can exhibit interjectional speech with a long latency, and the words expressed are produced as if under pressure. The ability to repeat phrases is also impaired. Despite these impairments, the produced words are often intelligible and contextually correct. In pure Broca aphasia, comprehension is intact. Patients with Broca aphasia are often very upset about their difficulty communicating. This may be due to the deficit or damage to adjacent frontal lobe structures, which control the inhibition of negative emotions. Broca aphasia can accompany other neurological deficits such as right facial weakness, hemiparesis or hemiplegia, and apraxia.
Document 11 (Title: Neurology_Adams): Broca aphasia conforms to a primary deficit in language output and speech production with relative preservation of comprehension. There is a wide range of variation in the severity of the motor speech deficit, from the mildest poverty of speech and minimal dysarthria with entirely intact comprehension and ability to write (so-called Broca area aphasia; “mini-Broca”), to a complete loss of all means of lingual, phonetic, written, and gestural communication. Because the muscles that can no longer be used in speaking may still function in other acts, they are not paralyzed. The term apraxia has been imprecisely applied to this deficit in oro-buccal-lingual use (it does not represent the loss of a previously learned ability) but there are accompanying apractic deficits of the orofacial apparatus as noted in the following text.
Document 12 (Title: Cognitive and motor abilities in preschool hydrocephalics.): The neuropsychological performance of three groups of preschool children was evaluated: (a) one with hydrocephalus associated with myelomeningocele; (b) one with hydrocephalus associated with intraventricular hemorrhage and very low birth weight; and (c) a nonhydrocephalic normal comparison group. Multivariate profile analysis revealed lower levels of performance on measures of verbal and nonverbal cognitive skills for both groups of hydrocephalic children relative to normals. Comparison of group profiles on tasks requiring figure copying as opposed to figure matching and analysis of specific gross and fine motor skills revealed that both hydrocephalic groups had impaired visual-motor integration in the presence of average visual perceptual matching. In addition, different patterns of motor skill deficits were found for each hydrocephalic group. The results of this study suggest that decreased visual-motor integration and etiology-specific motor deficits are major sequelae of these forms of hydrocephalus in the preschool years.
Document 13 (Title: Localization of speech parameters by brain scan.): Speech was studied in 18 patients who had a positive radioisotope brain scan within the left hemisphere and a history of a single stroke. Seventeen patients had definite language impariment. In most cases of either fluent or nonfluent aphasia, the center of the scan was behind the central sulcus. Patients with perisylvian involvement were much more likely to have severe comprehension deficit than those without such involvement. Those patients with the most severely decreased fluency were significantly more likely than those more fluent to have markedly decreased comprehension. In an occasional patient, involvement of fluency and comprehension was divergent, suggesting that these processes may be differentially affected.
Document 14 (Title: Fluent aphasia in children: definition and natural history.): We compared the course of a preschool child we followed for 4 years with published reports of 24 children with fluent aphasia. Our patient spoke fluently within 3 weeks of the injury. She was severely anomic and made many semantic paraphasic errors. Unlike other children with fluent aphasia, her prosody of speech was impaired initially, and her spontaneous language was dominated by stock phrases. Residual deficits include chronic impairment of auditory comprehension, repetition, and word retrieval. She has more disfluencies in spontaneous speech 4 years after her head injury than acutely. School achievement in reading and mathematics remains below age level. Attention to the timing of recovery of fluent speech and to the characteristics of receptive and expressive language over time will permit more accurate description of fluent aphasia in childhood.
Document 15 (Title: Neuroanatomy, Broca Area -- Clinical Significance): Insults and injury to the brain and the Broca area may lead to Broca's aphasia. Also known as expressive aphasia, it is non-fluent aphasia characterized by partially losing the ability to produce spoken and written language. Their speech will still contain important content, but they may omit articles, prepositions, and other words that only have grammatical significance. Thus, they are said to have "telegraphic speech." The aphasia can vary in severity, and in some cases, patients may only be able to speak in single-word sentences. In other words, these individuals know what they are trying to say, but they cannot say it. Patients will also lose the ability of repetition, as an intact Broca area, Wernicke's area, and arcuate fasciculus are required to repeat words or phrases. These patients do not entirely lose their ability to comprehend, but they exhibit an increased effort of speech. This is because language comprehension is primarily a function of Wernicke's area, located in the posterior superior temporal gyrus. Therefore, they are typically aware of their deficits, and Broca aphasia patients are likely to become frustrated and often develop depression. It is also essential to differentiate dysphasia from dysarthria. Those with dysarthria have problems speaking because of an inability to move mouth and tongue musculature, while expressive aphasia is more issues with word-finding. [11] [12]
