Document 1 (Title: Scrub typhus): Signs and symptoms Signs and symptoms include fever, headache, muscle pain, cough, and gastrointestinal symptoms. More virulent strains of O. tsutsugamushi can cause hemorrhaging and intravascular coagulation. Morbilliform rash, eschar, splenomegaly, and lymphadenopathies are typical signs. Leukopenia and abnormal liver function tests are commonly seen in the early phase of the illness. Pneumonitis, encephalitis, and myocarditis occur in the late phase of illness. It has particularly been shown to be the most common cause of acute encephalitis syndrome in Bihar, India. Causes Scrub typhus is transmitted by some species of trombiculid mites ("chiggers", particularly Leptotrombidium deliense), which are found in areas of heavy scrub vegetation. The mites feed on infected rodent hosts and subsequently transmit the parasite to other rodents and humans. The bite of this mite leaves a characteristic black eschar that is useful to the doctor for making the diagnosis.
Document 2 (Title: Weil Felix Test -- Etiology and Epidemiology): The etiologic agents of rickettsial diseases have diverse transmission mechanisms, wide geographic distributions, and a range of disease manifestations. Rickettsiae are most commonly transmitted through fleas, ticks, mites, or mouse vectors, with humans acting as incidental hosts. [4] The Rickettsiaceae that cause life-threatening infections are R. rickettsii (rocky mountain spotted fever), R. prowazekii (louse-borne typhus), Orientia tsutsugamushi (scrub typhus), R. conorii (Mediterranean spotted fever), R. typhi (murine typhus); and, in rare cases, other organisms of the spotted fever group. Most rickettsial species are limited to a particular region due to climatic conditions and natural host constraints; however, some rickettsia species can be encountered globally, such as R. felis and R. typhi . [5] Epidemiologic clues can be used to narrow the possible bacterial etiologies of a suspected rickettsial infection. [6] These clues include:
Document 3 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): 1154 Rickettsial diseases David H. Walker, J. Stephen Dumler, Thomas Marrie The rickettsiae are a heterogeneous group of small, obligately intra-cellular, gram-negative coccobacilli and short bacilli, most of which are transmitted by a tick, mite, flea, or louse vector. Except in the case of louse-borne typhus, humans are incidental hosts. Among 211 Epidemiologic clues to the transmission of a particular pathogen include (1) environmental exposure to ticks, fleas, or mites during the season of activity of the vector species for the disease in the appropriate geographic region (spotted fever and typhus rickettsioses, scrub typhus, ehrlichioses, anaplasmosis); (2) travel to or residence in an endemic geographic region during the incubation period (Table 211-1); (3) expo-sure to parturient ruminants, cats, and dogs (Q fever); (4) exposure to flying squirrels (R. prowazekii infection); and (5) history of previous louse-borne typhus (recrudescent typhus). Clinical laboratory findings, such
Document 4 (Title: Chigger mites of the genus Leptotrombidium: key to species and their distribution in China.): Chigger mites of the genus Leptotrombidium (Acari: Trombiculidae) transmit scrub typhus, caused by Rickettsia tsutsugamushi (= R.orientalis) in South-East Asia. In China, eighty-two species of Leptotrombidium have been recorded; these are listed with the names of Provinces where they were found. Five species, L.deliense, L.insularae, L.kaohuense, L.rubellum and L.scutellare, have been implicated as Chinese vectors of scrub typhus. A brief key is given to the larvae of all but three of the Leptotrombidium mites known in China.
Document 5 (Title: Rickettsia): Rickettsia species are transmitted by numerous types of arthropod, including chigger, ticks, fleas, and lice, and are associated with both human and plant diseases. Most notably, Rickettsia species are the pathogens responsible for typhus, rickettsialpox, boutonneuse fever, African tick-bite fever, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, Flinders Island spotted fever, and Queensland tick typhus (Australian tick typhus). The majority of Rickettsia bacteria are susceptible to antibiotics of the tetracycline group. Classification The classification of Rickettsia into three groups (spotted fever, typhus, and scrub typhus) was initially based on serology. This grouping has since been confirmed by DNA sequencing. All three of these groups include human pathogens. The scrub typhus group has been reclassified as a related new genus, Orientia, but they still are in the order Rickettsiales and accordingly still are grouped with the rest of the rickettsial diseases.
Document 6 (Title: Weil Felix Test -- Etiology and Epidemiology): Environmental exposure to ticks, fleas, or mites in regions and seasons where vector-borne diseases are prevalent, such as spotted fever and typhus rickettsioses, scrub typhus, ehrlichioses, and anaplasmosis Travel to or residence in an endemic region Exposure to pregnant ruminants, cats, or dogs, indicating possible Q fever Exposure to flying squirrels, associated with R. prowazekii typhus History of previous louse-borne typhus, which may lead to recrudescent typhus [7]
Document 7 (Title: Scrub typhus: an imported Rickettsial disease.): A case of scrub typhus due to Rickettsia tsutsugamushi is reported. This imported rickettsial disease was contracted by a 30-year-old woman while traveling in Thailand, and was transmitted by an infected mite's bite. Diagnosis was confirmed by specific serology and resolution was obtained by tetracycline therapy. Current concepts of the disease are reviewed.
Document 8 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Rickettsial infections dominated by fever may resolve without further clinical evolution. However, after nonspecific early manifestations, the illnesses can also evolve along one or more of several principal clinical lines: (1) development of a macular or maculopapular rash; (2) development of an eschar at the site of tick or mite feeding; (3) development of a vesicular rash (often in rickettsialpox and African tick-bite fever); (4) development of pneumonitis with chest radiographic opacities and/or rales (Q fever and severe cases of Rocky Mountain spotted fever [RMSF], Mediterranean spotted fever [MSF], louse-borne typhus, human monocytotropic ehrlichiosis [HME], human granulocytotropic anaplasmosis [HGA], scrub typhus, and murine typhus); (5) development of meningoencephalitis (louse-borne typhus and severe cases of RMSF, scrub typhus, HME, murine typhus, MSF, and [rarely] Q fever); and (6) progressive hypotension and multiorgan failure as seen with sepsis or toxic shock syndromes
Document 9 (Title: Ectoparasites of commensal rodents in Sulawesi Utara, Indonesia, with notes on species of medical importance.): Ectoparasite records are presented for four species of commensal murid rodents (Rattus rattus palelae Miller &amp; Hollister, R. argentiventer (Robinson &amp; Kloss), R. exulans (Peale) and Mus musculus castaneus Waterhouse) in Sulawesi Utara, with particular reference to the potential for these arthropods to bite and transmit pathogens to humans. The flea, Xenopsylla cheopis (Rothschild), was most common on R.r. palelae and is capable of transmitting plague and other pathogens to humans although no current foci for these diseases are known in Sulawesi. Hoplopleura pacifica Ewing and Polyplax spinulosa (Burmeister) sucking lice parasitized all three Rattus species although H. pacifica was mainly associated with R. exulans and P. spinulosa with R.r. palelae. These lice do not bite humans but may be intramurid vectors of murine typhus and other zoonoses. The mites Laelaps echidnina Berlese and L. nuttalli Hirst were both collected; the latter was recorded from all four murid species, mainly R. exulans. The mite Ornithonyssus bacoti Hirst was rare. Only one chigger mite, Walchiella oudemansi (Walch), was retrieved from murids (from R. exulans) and a single Leptotrombidium deliense (Walch) chigger was taken from a human subject. Although L. deliense is a significant vector of scrub typhus, a disease known from Sulawesi, the L. deliense-R. argentiventer relationship frequently noted in the ecology of this rickettsial disease, was not evident in this survey. Other ectoparasites collected from murids were the ticks, Ixodes granulatus Supino (first record for Sulawesi), Haemaphysalis sp. and Dermacentor sp., the mites Myocoptes musculinus (Koch) and Listrophoroides cucullatus (Trouessart), acarids and a uropodid.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Document 10 (Title: Scrub Typhus -- Etiology): Scrub typhus is a significant cause of underdiagnosed acute febrile illness and is prevalent in endemic regions. This disease can affect multiple organ systems primarily through vasculitis and perivascular inflammation. Mite larvae or chiggers, which carry the pathogenic gram-negative bacteria, are the vectors to humans, and they transmit the organism through their bite. The infection persists in nature through transovarial transmission in the vector and occasionally in small mammals as a reservoir. [4]
Document 11 (Title: Neurology_Adams): The following are the major rickettsial diseases: 1. Epidemic typhus, small pockets of which are present in many developing parts of the world. It is transmitted from lice to humans and from person to person. 2. Murine (endemic) typhus, which is present in the same areas as Rocky Mountain spotted fever (see in the following text). It is transmitted by fleas from rats to humans. 3. Scrub typhus or tsutsugamushi fever, which is confined to eastern and southeastern Asia. It is transmitted by mites from infected rodents or humans. 4. Rocky Mountain spotted fever, first described in Montana, is most common in Long Island, Tennessee, Virginia, North Carolina, and Maryland and in the Southwest. It is transmitted by special varieties of ticks.
Document 12 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): in spotted fever and typhus rickettsioses, ehrlichioses, anaplasmosis, and scrub typhus), normal or low WBC counts, mild to moderate serum elevations of hepatic aminotransferases, and hyponatremia, suggest some common pathophysiologic mechanisms. Application of these clinical, epidemiologic, and laboratory principles requires consideration of a rickettsial diagnosis and knowledge of the individual diseases.

Document 14 (Title: [Scrub typhus--one case report].): Scrub typhus (tsutsugamushi disease) is an acute infectious disease caused by Rickettsia tsutsugamushi transmitted through the bite of larvae of certain trombiculid mites. Geographical distribution in Asian-Pacific region is much of the roughly triangular area bounded by Japan, Pakistan and Australia. It is an endemic illness in the Pescadores Islands, but has scarcely been reported in central Taiwan. An eleven-year-old boy was admitted to Changhua Christian Hospital with the chief complaints of fever, lethargy and skin rash for seven days. On physical examination, he was found to have painless eschar, conjunctivitis, meningoencephalitis, pneumonitis, ascites, jaundice, hepatomegaly, liver function impairment and thrombocytopenia. His Proteus OX-K agglutinin titer increased from 1:160 in the acute sera to 1:640 in the convalescent sera. A greater than four-fold rise (greater than 1:640) in antibody titers to Karp, Gilliam, Kato strains of R. tsutsugamushi between acute and convalescent sera were demonstrated by immunofluorescent antibody. The patient was treated with minocycline and chloramphenicol and was completely recovered.
Document 15 (Title: Pathology_Robbins): Table 9.3 ). Chlamydia and Rickettsia are obligate intracellular bacteria that replicate inside membrane-bound vacuoles in epithelial and endothelial cells, respectively. These bacteria get most or all of their energy source, ATP, from the host cell. Chlamydia trachomatis is a frequent infectious cause of female sterility (by scarring and narrowing of the fallopian tubes) and blindness (by chronic inflammation of the conjunctiva that eventually causes scarring and opacification of the cornea). Rickettsiae injure the endothelial cells in which they grow, causing a hemorrhagic vasculitis, often visible as a rash, but they also may injure the central nervous system (CNS), with potentially fatal outcome, as in Rocky Mountain spotted fever and epidemic typhus. Rickettsiae are transmitted by arthropod vectors, including lice (in epidemic typhus), ticks (in Rocky Mountain spotted fever and ehrlichiosis), and mites (in scrub typhus).
