Document 1 (Title: Pathology_Robbins): Hydronephrosis refers to dilation of the renal pelvis and calyces, with accompanying atrophy of the parenchyma, caused by obstruction to the outflow of urine. The obstruction may be sudden or insidious, and it may occur at any level of the urinary tract, from the urethra to the renal pelvis. The most common causes are categorized as follows: Congenital, such as atresia of the urethra, valve formations in either the ureter or urethra, an aberrant renal artery compressing the ureter, renal ptosis with torsion, or kinking of the ureter Foreign bodies, such as calculi or sloughed necrotic papillae Proliferative lesions, such as benign prostatic hyperplasia, carcinoma of the prostate, bladder tumors (papilloma and carcinoma), contiguous malignant disease (retroperitoneal lymphoma, and carcinoma of the cervix or uterus) Inflammatory lesions, such as prostatitis, ureteritis, urethritis, and retroperitoneal fibrosis
Document 2 (Title: Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia -- Introduction): The development ofÂ BPH is characterized by stromal and epithelial cell proliferation in the prostate transition zone, which surrounds the urethra. This leads to urethral compression and bladder outflow obstruction, which can result in clinical manifestations of LUTS, urinary retention, or infections due to incomplete bladder emptying. [5] Long-term, untreated disease can lead to the development of chronic high-pressure retention (a potentially life-threatening condition) and long-term or permanent changes to the bladder detrusor muscle.
Document 3 (Title: Hydronephrosis): The most common causes of hydronephrosis in children are anatomical abnormalities. These include vesicoureteral reflux, urethral stricture, and stenosis. The most common cause of hydronephrosis in young adults is kidney stones. In older adults, the most common cause of hydronephrosis is benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH), or intrapelvic neoplasms such as prostate cancer. Compression of one or both ureters can also be caused by other developmental defects not completely occurring during the fetal stage such as an abnormally placed vein, artery, or tumor. Bilateral compression of the ureters can occur during pregnancy due to enlargement of the uterus. Changes in hormone levels during this time may also affect the muscle contractions of the bladder, further complicating this condition. Sources of obstruction that can arise from other various causes include kidney stones, blood clots or retroperitoneal fibrosis.
Document 4 (Title: Chronic kidney disease): By anatomical location Vascular disease includes large vessel disease such as bilateral kidney artery stenosis and small vessel disease such as ischemic nephropathy, hemolytic-uremic syndrome, and vasculitis. Glomerular disease comprises a diverse group and is classified into: Primary glomerular disease such as focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and IgA nephropathy (or nephritis) Secondary glomerular disease such as diabetic nephropathy and lupus nephritis Tubulointerstitial disease includes drug- and toxin-induced chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis, and reflux nephropathy. Obstructive nephropathy, as exemplified by bilateral kidney stones and benign prostatic hyperplasia of the prostate gland. Rarely, pinworms infecting the kidney can cause obstructive nephropathy.
Document 5 (Title: [Benign prostatic hyperplasia as a frequent senile disease of the male].): An adenofibromyomatous proliferation starting from the region of the periurethral glands is referred to as benign prostatic hyperplasia. It is the result of a senile endocrinopathy, which leads to a disbalance of the peripheral hormonal milieu, and of an intraglandular disturbance of the utilization of the hormone. It becomes a disease when it is followed by an increase of the vesical outlet resistance and thus by an obstructive disturbance of the voiding of the urinary bladder. The indication for operation is determined by the degree of the obstruction and its pathophysiological sequelae as well as the complaints of the patients. The conservative therapy is above all symptomatic and indicated only at the initial stage of the disease. The transurethral resection is the operative therapy of choice. In very large hyperplasias the open surgical intervention may be necessary. In inoperable patients a urethral catheter should be renounced for a suprapubic puncture cystostomy. Also after operative ectomy of a benign prostatic hyperplasia the patients may fall ill with a carcinoma of the prostatic gland. Therefore, the duty for undergoing an annual preventive medical examination remains.
Document 6 (Title: Cold sensation and bladder instability in patients with outflow obstruction due to benign prostatic hyperplasia.): A series of 73 patients with bladder outflow obstruction caused by benign prostatic hyperplasia underwent urodynamic investigation, including the cold water test. The presence of detrusor instability was associated with a higher urethral opening pressure, maximum detrusor pressure and detrusor pressure at maximum flow. Instability was more common and more pronounced in patients with a lack of cold sensation, but there were some patients who, whilst lacking cold sensation, still possessed the cold reflex. This suggests partial denervation of the bladder or some form of altered modulation of sensory activity within the spinal cord or central nervous system. On the other hand, some of the patients lacked cold sensation but showed a stable detrusor and a high maximum cystometric capacity. This leads to the conclusion that there are different mechanisms by which the bladder reacts to outflow obstruction.
Document 7 (Title: Urethral Strictures -- History and Physical): A key difference between benign prostatic hyperplasia and urethral stricture disease is obstructed ejaculation. [8] In addition, patients with urethral strictures do not respond to typical benign prostatic hyperplasia therapy, such as alpha-blocker medications, and the weak urinary stream is relatively constant without much variation.
Document 8 (Title: Histopathology of prostatic tissue after transurethral hyperthermia.): Histopathological changes were studied in four patients who had moderate to severe urinary outflow obstruction due to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and were treated with transurethral microwave hyperthermia (TUMH). All these patients received TUMH with a helical antenna using a BSD 300 unit. The temperature was controlled on the urethral surface at 45 degrees C +/- 1 degree C. Each treatment session lasted 70 min at this temperature. Histological changes were periurethral, extending up to 6 mm radially and 4-5 cm longitudinally. They were symmetrical and most severe in the immediate periurethral zone. The severity and distribution of these histological changes correlated well with the thermal profile of the helical antenna. Acute changes, observed 24-48 h following administration of a single TUMH session, consisted of periurethral oedema, parenchymal haemorrhages and occasional, partial small-vessel thrombosis. Selective coagulation necrosis of the parenchymal smooth muscles with sparing of smooth muscle fibres in the vessel walls was noted. Histopathological changes found in patients 7 or 26 days following the administration of 10 TUMH treatments given twice-weekly for 5 weeks showed more severe and deeper lesions. They consisted of interstitial haemorrhages, complete obliteration of blood vessel lumina due to thrombosis and further evidence of coagulation and haemorrhagic necrosis. Evidence of a reparative process with ingrowth of granulation tissue in various stages of organization was clearly demonstrated. The effect of TUMH on BPH-obstructed urethra is probably expressed through selective shrinking and retraction of the periurethral prostatic parenchyma due to organizing localized tissue necrosis and cicatrization. Details of this complex process will be presented.
Document 9 (Title: Prostatic titanium urethral stents. A new treatment option for obstructive uropathy: early clinical results and indications.): An expandable titanium stent was used as an alternative to standard treatment for urinary obstruction in 20 men. Six patients had recurrent urethral strictures. Fourteen patients had obstruction secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and were considered high risk surgical candidates. Complete results with a mean follow-up of 12 months are available for 11 patients. Four of the six stricture patients are currently unobstructed. All seven of the available men with BPH are voiding well. No side effects have been related to the stents, and no encrustations or calculi have formed.
Document 10 (Title: Bladder Post Void Residual Volume -- Clinical Significance -- Obstruction): One researcher found that 9.5% of admitted patients to a geriatric unit with acute kidney injury had a pre-existing renal disease caused by obstructive uropathy. [41] Bladder outlet obstruction, namely benign prostatic hyperplasia, leads to profound changes and permanent damage to bladder structure and function, which may be irreversible. [42]
Document 11 (Title: Acute kidney injury): Intrinsic or renal Intrinsic AKI refers to disease processes which directly damage the kidney itself. Intrinsic AKI can be due to one or more of the kidney's structures including the glomeruli, kidney tubules, or the interstitium. Common causes of each are glomerulonephritis, acute tubular necrosis (ATN), and acute interstitial nephritis (AIN), respectively. Other causes of intrinsic AKI are rhabdomyolysis and tumor lysis syndrome. Certain medication classes such as calcineurin inhibitors (e.g., tacrolimus) can also directly damage the tubular cells of the kidney and result in a form of intrinsic AKI. Postrenal Postrenal AKI refers to acute kidney injury caused by disease states downstream of the kidney and most often occurs as a consequence of urinary tract obstruction. This may be related to benign prostatic hyperplasia, kidney stones, obstructed urinary catheter, bladder stones, or cancer of the bladder, ureters, or prostate. Diagnosis
Document 12 (Title: Pathoma_Husain): 2. For example, cardiac myocytes undergo hypertrophy, not hyperplasia, in response to systemic hypertension (Fig. 1.1). E. Pathologic hyperplasia (e.g., endometrial hyperplasia) can progress to dysplasia and, eventually, cancer. 1. A notable exception is benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), which does not increase the risk for prostate cancer. III. ATROPHY A. A decrease in stress (e.g., decreased hormonal stimulation, disuse, or decreased nutrients/blood supply) leads to a decrease in organ size (atrophy). 1. Occurs via a decrease in the size and number of cells B. Decrease in cell number occurs via apoptosis. C. Decrease in cell size occurs via ubiquitin-proteosome degradation of the cytoskeleton and autophagy of cellular components. 1. In ubiquitin-proteosome degradation, intermediate filaments of the cytoskeleton are "tagged" with ubiquitin and destroyed by proteosomes. 2.

Document 14 (Title: Evaluation of flow electromyography in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia.): Combined uroflowmetry and external sphincter electromyography studies were done both preoperatively and postoperatively in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia. In 56 patients preoperative electromyography during voiding showed silent or markedly suppressed activity in 41 patients (73.2%), while the remaining 15 patients (27.8%) revealed active electromyography. In the postoperative studies, 12 patients revealed active electromyography even after the release of obstruction. The urine flow rate following operation was not drastically improved in the active electromyography group compared to the silent electromyography group. We suppose that long-term urethral obstruction with prostatic adenoma could influence the function of relaxation of the external sphincter muscle in some patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia.
