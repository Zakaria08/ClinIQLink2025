Document 1 (Title: [Acute diltiazem (DTZ) poisoning. Survey of french poison control centers].): The end-points of this study upon 134 cases reports by the french Poison Centers from 1979 to 1988 (10 years) were to specify the acute toxicity of diltiazem (DTZ). There were 83 self-poisonings in adults, with diltiazem alone (36 cases) or associated with other non cardiotoxic drugs (47), the doses of DTZ ranging from 300 to 5400 mg, and 51 acute accidental overdose in children, the doses of DTZ ranging from 60 to 420 mg. One case of hypotension was observed in a child, without rhythmic disorder, occurring twelve hours post-ingestion of 180 mg of DTZ. In adults, the clinical effects were observed following 360 mg of dose DTZ, occurring 1 1/2 hour post-ingestion. There were discomfort, brady-cardia in 16% of the cases, hypotension in 23% of the cases, cardiogenic shock in 4% of the cases and cardiac arrest in 2.4% of the cases. The rhythmic disorders occurred 2 to 15 hours post-ingestion. There were conduction defects like atrio-ventricular heart bloc I degree in 9% of the cases, II degree in 2.4% of the cases and III degree in 9% of the cases. Less frequently, sinusal bradycardia in 11% of the cases or sino-auricular heart block in 4% of the cases with sometimes auriculo ventricular heart block. These cardiac disorders occurred with 600 mg of DTZ. A cardiac arrest happened in a young healthy man who had absorbed 5400 mg of DTZ. The cardiogenic shocks occurred in patients with an history of coronary on heart disease. The poison removal is likely to prevent the occurrence of clinical or EKG effects when performed within 2 hours post-ingestion, whatever toxic the dose is. The inotropic drugs have been used in 18% of the cases; a percutaneous ventricular pacing was always effective in patients with II or III degree atrio-ventricular block or/and cardiogenir shock. These data confirm the data in thirteen patients of the literature. The acute diltiazem poisoning can occur after 600 mg of DTZ and can induce severe cardiac disorders which can be prevented with poison removal or treated with supportive care.
Document 2 (Title: Psichiatry_DSM-5): resulting from the use of other substances or medications, such as serotonin syndrome; parkinsonian hyperthermia syndrome following abrupt discontinuation of dopamine ag- thesia; hyperthermia associated with abuse of stimulants and hallucinogens; and atropine poisoning from anticholinergics. In rare instances, individuals with schizophrenia or a mood disorder may present with malignant catatonia, which may be indistinguishable from neuroleptic malignant syn- drome. Some investigators consider neuroleptic malignant syndrome to be a drug- induced form of malignant catatonia. 333.72 (624.02) Medication-Induced Acute Dystonia Abnormal and prolonged contraction of the muscles of the eyes (oculogyric crisis), head, neck (torticollis or retrocollis), limbs, or trunk developing within a few days of starting or raising the dosage of a medication (such as a neuroleptic) or after reducing the dosage of a medication used to treat extrapyramidal symptoms.
Document 3 (Title: Carbamazepine -- Toxicity): In adults, doses of carbamazepine exceeding 24 grams have correlated with fatal outcomes. Acute toxicity appears after 1 to 3 hours of intake and presents with neuromuscular disturbances. Patients have impaired consciousness leading to coma, tremor, restlessness, athetoid movements, psychomotor disturbances, dizziness, drowsiness, mydriasis, and nystagmus. Initially, patients experience hyperreflexia, but during intoxication, they progress into a state of hyporeflexia. Cardiac, vascular signs are generally mild with low toxicity, but with doses higher than 60 grams, severe cardiac dysfunction can occur. In cases of acute toxicity, respiratory depression, ECG abnormalities, tachycardia, shock, and urinary retention require monitoring and management to avoid end-organ damage. Treatment of an overdose focuses on eliminating the drug by inducing vomiting, gastric lavage, activated charcoal, and forced diuresis. Gastric lavage is indicated even after 4 hours of indigestion. [21] Seizures caused by carbamazepine poisoning should receive treatment with benzodiazepines such as diazepam.

Document 5 (Title: Tramadol): Dependence and withdrawal Long-term use of high doses of tramadol causes physical dependence and withdrawal syndrome. These include both symptoms typical of opioid withdrawal and those associated with serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) withdrawal; symptoms include numbness, tingling, paresthesia, and tinnitus. Psychiatric symptoms may include hallucinations, paranoia, extreme anxiety, panic attacks, and confusion. In most cases, tramadol withdrawal will set in 12–20 hours after the last dose, but this can vary. Tramadol withdrawal typically lasts longer than that of other opioids. Seven days or more of acute withdrawal symptoms can occur as opposed to typically 3 or 4 days for other codeine analogues. Overdose Recognised risk factors for tramadol overdose include respiratory depression, addiction, and seizures. Naloxone only partially reverses the toxic effects of tramadol overdose and may increase the risk of seizures.
Document 6 (Title: Diphenhydramine): Acute poisoning can be fatal, leading to cardiovascular collapse and death in 2–18 hours, and in general is treated using a symptomatic and supportive approach. Diagnosis of toxicity is based on history and clinical presentation, and in general specific levels are not useful. Several levels of evidence strongly indicate diphenhydramine (similar to chlorpheniramine) can block the delayed rectifier potassium channel and, as a consequence, prolong the QT interval, leading to cardiac arrhythmias such as torsades de pointes. No specific antidote for diphenhydramine toxicity is known, but the anticholinergic syndrome has been treated with physostigmine for severe delirium or tachycardia. Benzodiazepines may be administered to decrease the likelihood of psychosis, agitation, and seizures in people who are prone to these symptoms. Interactions Alcohol may increase the drowsiness caused by diphenhydramine. Pharmacology Pharmacodynamics
Document 7 (Title: Neurological syndromes produced by some toxic metals encountered industrially or environmentally.): Toxic metals encountered industrially or environmentally may produce the following syndromes: 1) Peripheral neuropathy: which is mainly sensory in arsenic and entirely motor with inorganic lead, organophosphorus compounds and tallium produce a mixed form of peripheral neuropathy. 2) Encephalopathy: usually with lead poisoning where ataxia and hemiplegia or optic atrophy may occur. 3) Optic neuritis: transient or permanent impairment of vision in arsenic poisoning and blurring of vision followed by field fedects with thallium poisoning. 4) Cerebellar disturbances: in the form of ataxia in organic mercury. 5) Parkinsonism: extrapyramidal signs occurs in manganese poisoning shown as mask face and rigidity of muscles. 6) Mental changes: as acute psychosis in organic lead and erethism in organic mercury.
Document 8 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): PART 18 Poisoning, Drug Overdose, and Envenomation 473e-6 in theophylline overdose. For poisons with central dopaminergic effects (methamphetamine, phencyclidine) manifested by psychotic behavior, a dopamine receptor antagonist, such as haloperidol, may be useful. In anticholinergic and cyanide poisoning, specific antidotal therapy may be necessary. The treatment of seizures secondary to cerebral ischemia or edema or to metabolic abnormalities should include correction of the underlying cause. Neuromuscular paralysis is indicated in refractory cases. Electroencephalographic monitoring and continuing treatment of seizures are necessary to prevent permanent neurologic damage. Serotonergic receptor overstimulation in serotonin syndrome may be treated with cyproheptadine. Other Measures Temperature extremes, metabolic abnormalities, hepatic and renal dysfunction, and secondary complications should be treated by standard therapies.
Document 9 (Title: First_Aid_Step2): SSRIs Fluoxetine, sertraline, paroxetine, citalopram, f uvoxamine Depression and anxiety. Sexual side effects, GI distress, agitation, insomnia, tremor, diarrhea. Serotonin syndrome (fever, myoclonus, mental status changes, cardiovascular collapse) can occur if SSRIs are used with MAOIs. Paroxetine can cause pulmonary hypertension in the fetus. Atypicals Bupropion, venlafaxine, mirtazapine, trazodone Depression, anxiety, and chronic pain. Bupropion: ↓ seizure threshold; minimal sexual side effects. Contraindicated in patients with eating disorders as well as in seizure patients. Venlafaxine: Diastolic hypertension. Mirtazapine: Weight gain, sedation. Trazodone: Highly sedating; priapism. Nortriptyline, desipramine, amitriptyline, imipramine Depression, anxiety disorder, chronic pain, migraine headaches, enuresis (imipramine). Lethal with overdose owing to cardiac conduction arrhythmias (e.g., long QRS). Monitor in the ICU for 3–4 days following an OD. Anticholinergic effects (dry
Document 10 (Title: 5'-nucleotidase): Relation to lead poisoning Numerous studies have shown that erythrocyte pyrimidine 5'nucleotidase activity is significantly lowered in patients with lead poisoning, and that pyrimidine 5'nucleotidase activity can be used as an index of lead poisoning. It is believed that lead induced deficiency of the enzyme in maturing erythroid cells is responsible for basophilic stippling and hemolysis in a manner analogous to the pathogenesis of the hereditary enzyme deficiency syndrome. The mechanism of inhibition of 5'nucleotidase in lead poisoning may contribute to the hemolytic syndromes that occur in patients with acute lead poisoning. Since erythrocyte pyrimidine 5'NT activity is inhibited in vitro by various metals (e.g., copper, zinc, cadmium, lead, mercury, and tin), it is likely that inhibition of pyrimidine 5'nucleotidase may contribute to the hemolytic syndromes that occur in patients with acute poisoning by these metals.

Induced emesis or gastric lavage is indicated chrome pigment production industries have consistently had a greater within 4–6 h of acute ingestion; Prussian blue prevents absorption risk of lung cancer. The introduction of cobalt chloride as a fortifier in and is given orally at 250 mg/kg in divided doses. Unlike other types beer led to outbreaks of fatal cardiomyopathy among heavy consum-of metal poisoning, thallium poisoning may be less severe when actiers. Occupational exposure (e.g., of miners, dry-battery manufacturers, vated charcoal is used to interrupt its enterohepatic circulation. Other and arc welders) to manganese can cause a parkinsonian syndrome measures include forced diuresis, treatment with potassium chloride within 1–2 years, including gait disorders; postural instability; a (which promotes renal excretion of thallium), and peritoneal dialysis.
Document 12 (Title: Cyclophosphamide): This risk may be dependent on dose and other factors, including the condition, other agents or treatment modalities (including radiotherapy), treatment length and intensity. For some regimens, it is rare. For instance, CMF-therapy for breast cancer (where the cumulative dose is typically less than 20 grams of cyclophosphamide) carries an AML risk of less than 1/2000, with some studies finding no increased risk compared to background. Other treatment regimens involving higher doses may carry risks of 1–2% or higher. Cyclophosphamide-induced AML, when it happens, typically presents some years after treatment, with incidence peaking around 3–9 years. After nine years, the risk falls to background. When AML occurs, it is often preceded by a myelodysplastic syndrome phase, before developing into overt acute leukemia. Cyclophosphamide-induced leukemia will often involve complex cytogenetics, which carries a worse prognosis than de novo AML.
Document 13 (Title: [State of the nervous system following acute chlorophos poisoning].): The authors describe the clinical traits of myeloradiculopolyneuritis (2 cases) and encephalopolyneuritis (1 case) developing 2--3 weeks following acute poisoning by chlorofos. Along with a distinct toxic polyneuritic syndrome there were also signs of pathology in the spinal cord and brain, as well as in the internal organs in the forms of toxic hepatitis and nephritis. The report contains data indicating a protracted development of the pathology, its direct dependence upon the depth of intoxication and disordered consciousness in the acute period. The authors express the opinion that in the described pathology there may be autoallergic mechanisms in the formation of myeloradiculopolyneuritis and encephalopolyneuritis following poisoning by chlorofos.
Document 14 (Title: Fluoride): Soluble fluoride salts, of which sodium fluoride is the most common, are toxic, and have resulted in both accidental and self-inflicted deaths from acute poisoning. The lethal dose for most adult humans is estimated at 5 to 10 g (which is equivalent to 32 to 64 mg/kg elemental fluoride/kg body weight). A case of a fatal poisoning of an adult with 4 grams of sodium fluoride is documented, and a dose of 120 g sodium fluoride has been survived. For sodium fluorosilicate (Na2SiF6), the median lethal dose (LD50) orally in rats is 0.125 g/kg, corresponding to 12.5 g for a 100 kg adult.
Document 15 (Title: Scombroid poisoning. A report of seven cases involving the Western Australian salmon, Arripis truttaceus.): To present the clinical findings of scombroid poisoning due to ingestion of the Western Australian salmon, Arripis truttaceus, occurring in two separate outbreaks involving seven patients. Both outbreaks occurred in March and the fish had been caught in South Australian waters. Onset of symptoms in all patients occurred within half an hour of ingestion of the affected fish. The clinical syndrome included erythema and urticaria of the skin, facial flushing and sweating, palpitations, hot flushes of the body, headache, nausea, vomiting and dizziness. The fish implicated in one outbreak was noted to have a peppery taste. The diagnosis of scombroid poisoning was confirmed by the presence of the clinical syndrome, and by demonstration of high histamine levels in the cooked fish. Two patients had minor symptoms which had resolved before seeking medical advice. Another two patients had mild symptoms which disappeared after two hours of observation and required no specific treatment. Three patients had evidence of major toxicity which was successfully treated with parenterally administered promethazine. One of the three patients with major toxicity required overnight admission and repeated doses of promethazine to eradicate her symptoms. No patient had symptoms for longer than 12 hours. Scombroid poisoning is caused by ingestion of fish which has accumulated scombrotoxin during spoilage. The toxin is heat stable and has been identified as histamine. The clinical presentation closely resembles an acute allergic reaction. This similarity in symptoms may result in the diagnosis of scombroid poisoning being missed by clinicians. Patients with the symptom complex may be incorrectly informed that they are allergic to the fish species. Diagnosis is clinical and can be confirmed by analysis of the histamine content of the fish. Treatment is with antihistamines, however major toxicity may require the same aggressive management as acute anaphylaxis.
