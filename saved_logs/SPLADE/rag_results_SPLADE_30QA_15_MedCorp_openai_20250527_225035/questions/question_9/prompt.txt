Document 1 (Title: Lipid metabolism): In the cytosol of the cell (for example a muscle cell), the glycerol will be converted to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, which is an intermediate in the glycolysis, to get further oxidized and produce energy. However, the main steps of fatty acids catabolism occur in the mitochondria. Long chain fatty acids (more than 14 carbon) need to be converted to fatty acyl-CoA in order to pass across the mitochondria membrane. Fatty acid catabolism begins in the cytoplasm of cells as acyl-CoA synthetase uses the energy from cleavage of an ATP to catalyze the addition of coenzyme A to the fatty acid. The resulting acyl-CoA cross the mitochondria membrane and enter the process of beta oxidation. The main products of the beta oxidation pathway are acetyl-CoA (which is used in the citric acid cycle to produce energy), NADH and FADH. The process of beta oxidation requires the following enzymes: acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, enoyl-CoA hydratase, 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, and 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase.
Document 2 (Title: Inactivation of soluble 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase of human placenta by fatty acids.): The sensitivity of soluble, 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17 beta-HSD) of human placenta to inactivation by fatty acids was examined. Exposure to the unsaturated fatty acids oleic, arachidonic, linoleic and linolenic acid resulted in the loss of activity. Methyl and ethyl esters of oleic acid, the saturated fatty acid, stearic acid and prostaglandins E2 and F2 alpha were without effect. Inactivation by oleic acid required the fatty acid at levels above its critical micelle concentration, 50 microM, as estimated by light-scattering. Steroid substrates and inhibitors did not protect against inactivation. NAD+, NADH, NADP+ and NADPH did protect. The concentrations of NADP+, 50 microM, and NAD, 1.5 mM, necessary for complete protection were significantly greater than their respective Michaelis constants, 0.16 microM and 15.2 microM. The data suggest that soluble 17 beta-HSD can bind to fatty acid micelles and that the binding site(s) on the enzyme are at or near pyridine nucleotide binding sites.
Document 3 (Title: Biochemistry, Fatty Acid Oxidation -- Fundamentals): Mitochondrial beta-oxidation can be used to supply acetyl coenzyme A (CoA) to 2 separate pathways, depending on which tissue oxidation occurs. In skeletal and cardiac muscle, mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation leads to substrate production for the tricarboxylic acid cycle in the form of acetyl CoA and provides adenosine triphosphate (ATP) for the myocytes. However, in hepatocytes, fatty acid oxidation provides acetyl CoA for ketone body synthesis during prolonged fasting conditions, in which glycogen stores have been depleted. Mitochondrial beta-oxidation yields 4 ATP equivalents per round of oxidation in the form of one flavin adenine dinucleotide, FAD(2H) molecule and 1 nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (reduced, NADH) molecule, as well as one acetyl CoA molecule.
Document 4 (Title: Biochemistry_Lippinco): 7.2. Which one of the following statements concerning dietary fat is correct? A. Coconut oil is rich in monounsaturated fats, and olive oil is rich in saturated fats. B. Fatty acids containing trans double bonds, unlike the naturally occurring cis isomers, raise high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. C. The polyunsaturated fatty acids linoleic and linolenic acids are required components. D. Triacylglycerols obtained from plants generally contain less unsaturated fatty acids than do those from animals. Correct answer = C. Humans are unable to make linoleic and linolenic fatty acids. Consequently, these fatty acids are essential in the diet. Coconut oil is rich in saturated fats, and olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fats. Trans fatty acids raise plasma levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, not high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Triacylglycerols obtained from plants generally contain more unsaturated fatty acids than do those from animals.
Document 5 (Title: Biochemistry_Lippinco): Unsaturated fatty acid β-oxidation: The oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids generates intermediates that cannot serve as substrates for 2,3-enoyl CoA hydratase (see Fig. 16.17). Consequently, additional enzymes are required. Oxidation of a double bond at an odd-numbered carbon, such as 18:1(9) (oleic acid), requires one additional enzyme, 3,2-enoyl CoA isomerase, which converts the 3-cis derivative obtained after three rounds of β-oxidation to the 2-trans derivative required by the hydratase. Oxidation of a double bond at an even-numbered carbon, such as 18:2(9,12) (linoleic acid), requires an NADPH-dependent 2,4-dienoyl CoA reductase in addition to the isomerase. [Note: Because unsaturated fatty acids are less reduced than saturated fatty acids, fewer reducing equivalents are produced by their oxidation.] 8.
Document 6 (Title: NADPH-dependent beta-oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids with double bonds extending from odd-numbered carbon atoms.): The mitochondrial metabolism of 5-enoyl-CoAs, which are formed during the beta-oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids with double bonds extending from odd-numbered carbon atoms, was studied with mitochondrial extracts and purified enzymes of beta-oxidation. Metabolites were identified spectrophotometrically and by high performance liquid chromatography. 5-cis-Octenoyl-CoA, a putative metabolite of linolenic acid, was efficiently dehydrogenated by medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (EC 1.3.99.3) to 2-trans-5-cis-octadienoyl-CoA, which was isomerized to 3,5-octadienoyl-CoA either by mitochondrial delta 3,delta 2-enoyl-CoA isomerase (EC 5.3.3.8) or by peroxisomal trifunctional enzyme. Further isomerization of 3,5-octadienoyl-CoA to 2-trans-4-trans-octadienoyl-CoA in the presence of soluble extracts of either rat liver or rat heart mitochondria was observed and attributed to a delta 3,5,delta 2,4-dienoyl-CoA isomerase. Qualitatively similar results were obtained with 2-trans-5-trans-octadienoyl-CoA formed by dehydrogenation of 5-trans-octenoyl-CoA. 2-trans-4-trans-Octadienoyl-CoA was a substrate for NADPH-dependent 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase (EC 1.3.1.34). A soluble extract of rat liver mitochondria catalyzed the isomerization of 2-trans-5-cis-octadienoyl-CoA to 2-trans-4-trans-octadienoyl-CoA, which upon addition of NADPH, NAD+, and CoA was chain-shortened to hexanoyl-CoA, butyryl-CoA, and acetyl-CoA. Thus we conclude that odd-numbered double bonds, like even-numbered double bonds, can be reductively removed during the beta-oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids.
Document 7 (Title: Vitamin B3 -- Mechanism of Action): Niacin is necessary for adequate cellular metabolism and is a vital component in coenzyme 1 (the oxidized state of NAD) and coenzyme 2 (the reduced form of NADP), which either accept or donate hydrogen ions in essential oxidation-reduction reactions. These coenzymes are important for glycolysis, pyruvate metabolism, protein, amino acid metabolism, pentose biosynthesis, glycerol metabolism, synthesis of high-energy phosphate bonds, and fatty acid metabolism. [2]
Document 8 (Title: Biochemistry, Fatty Acid Oxidation -- Molecular Level): Steps 1 through 4 refer to the beta-oxidation of a saturated fatty acid with an even-numbered carbon skeleton. Unsaturated fatty acids, such as oleate (18:1) and linoleate (18:2), contain cis double bonds that must be isomerized to the trans configuration (enoyl CoA isomerase) or reduced at the expense of an NADPH molecule (2,4-dienoyl CoA reductase).
Document 9 (Title: Branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex): Coenzymes This complex requires the following 5 coenzymes: Thiamine pyrophosphate Lipoate (lipoic acid) Coenzyme A Flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) Biological function In animal tissue, BCKDC catalyzes an irreversible step in the catabolism of the branched-chain amino acids L-isoleucine, L-valine, and L-leucine, acting on their deaminated derivatives (L-alpha-keto-beta-methylvalerate, alpha-ketoisovalerate, and alpha-ketoisocaproate, respectively) and converting them to α-Methylbutyryl-CoA, Isobutyryl-CoA and Isovaleryl-CoA respectively. In bacteria, this enzyme participates in the synthesis of branched, long-chain fatty acids. In plants, this enzyme is involved in the synthesis of branched, long-chain hydrocarbons. The overall catabolic reaction catalyzed by the BCKDC is shown in Figure 1.
Document 10 (Title: The enzymic formation of long chain aldehydes and alcohols by alpha-oxidation of fatty acids in extracts of cucumber fruit (Cucumis sativus).): 1. An enzyme system that catalyses the alpha-oxidation of fatty acids to shorter chain products is present in acetone powders of cucumber fruits. 2. In the absence of NAD+, the predominant product from palmitic acid is pentadecanal. Addition of NAD+ gives rise to a homologous series of n-alkanals, the concentrations of which are in the same order as that reported in the volatile products formed on homogenization of cucumbers, i.e. C15 greater than C14 greater than C13 greater than C12. 3. Pentadecan-1-ol is also formed from palmitic acid in the absence of added NAD+; C15, C14 and C13 n-alkanols are produced in the presence of NAD+. 4. The substrate specificity for saturated fatty acids is in the order C12 less than C14 greater than C16 greater than C18. Unsaturated C18 acids are oxidized more readily than stearic acid. 5. The alpha-oxidation system is inhibited by dithiothreitol, cysteine, imidazole and certain metal ligands (CN-, N3-, diphenylthiocarbazone) but not by EDTA. 6. Differences between the alpha-oxidation system in cucumber and those previously reported in other plants are discussed.
Document 11 (Title: Inhibition of steroid 5 alpha-reductase by specific aliphatic unsaturated fatty acids.): Human or rat microsomal 5 alpha-reductase activity, as measured by enzymic conversion of testosterone into 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone or by binding of a competitive inhibitor, [3H]17 beta-NN-diethulcarbamoyl-4-methyl-4-aza-5 alpha-androstan-3-one ([3H]4-MA) to the reductase, is inhibited by low concentrations (less than 10 microM) of certain polyunsaturated fatty acids. The relative inhibitory potencies of unsaturated fatty acids are, in decreasing order: gamma-linolenic acid greater than cis-4,7,10,13,16,19-docosahexaenoic acid = cis-6,9,12,15-octatetraenoic acid = arachidonic acid = alpha-linolenic acid greater than linoleic acid greater than palmitoleic acid greater than oleic acid greater than myristoleic acid. Other unsaturated fatty acids such as undecylenic acid, erucic acid and nervonic acid, are inactive. The methyl esters and alcohol analogues of these compounds, glycerols, phospholipids, saturated fatty acids, retinoids and carotenes were inactive even at 0.2 mM. The results of the binding assay and the enzymic assay correlated well except for elaidic acid and linolelaidic acid, the trans isomers of oleic acid and linoleic acid respectively, which were much less active than their cis isomers in the binding assay but were as potent in the enzymic assay. gamma-Linolenic acid had no effect on the activities of two other rat liver microsomal enzymes: NADH:menadione reductase and glucuronosyl transferase. gamma-Linolenic acid, the most potent inhibitor tested, decreased the Vmax. and increased Km values of substrates, NADPH and testosterone, and promoted dissociation of [3H]4-MA from the microsomal reductase. gamma-Linolenic acid, but not the corresponding saturated fatty acid (stearic acid), inhibited the 5 alpha-reductase activity, but not the 17 beta-dehydrogenase activity, of human prostate cancer cells in culture. These results suggest that unsaturated fatty acids may play an important role in regulating androgen action in target cells.
Document 12 (Title: Biochemistry_Lippinco): A. fatty acid oxidation. B. the ratio of the reduced oxidized forms of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. C. oxaloacetate and pyruvate. D. use of acetyl coenzyme A in fatty acid synthesis. Correct answer = B. The oxidation of ethanol to acetate by dehydrogenases is accompanied by the reduction of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) to NADH. The rise in the NADH/NAD+ ratio shifts pyruvate to lactate and oxaloacetate (OAA) to malate, decreasing the availability of substrates for gluconeogenesis and resulting in hypoglycemia. The rise in NADH also reduces the NAD+ needed for fatty acid (FA) oxidation. The decrease in OAA shunts any acetyl coenzyme A produced to ketogenesis. Note that the inhibition of FA degradation results in their reesterification into triacylglycerol that can result in fatty liver.
Document 13 (Title: Natural product): Primary metabolite enzymatic cofactors include members of the vitamin B family. Vitamin B1 as thiamine diphosphate is a coenzyme for pyruvate dehydrogenase, 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase, and transketolase which are all involved in carbohydrate metabolism. Vitamin B2 (riboflavin) is a constituent of FMN and FAD which are necessary for many redox reactions. Vitamin B3 (nicotinic acid or niacin), synthesized from tryptophan is a component of the coenzymes NAD and NADP which in turn are required for electron transport in the Krebs cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, as well as many other redox reactions. Vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid) is a constituent of coenzyme A, a basic component of carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism as well as the biosynthesis of fatty acids and polyketides. Vitamin B6 (pyridoxol, pyridoxal, and pyridoxamine) as pyridoxal 5′-phosphate is a cofactor for many enzymes especially transaminases involve in amino acid metabolism. Vitamin B12 (cobalamins) contain a corrin
Document 14 (Title: 2,4-Dienoyl-coenzyme A reductase deficiency: a possible new disorder of fatty acid oxidation.): Several inherited disorders of fatty acid beta-oxidation have been described that relate mainly to saturated precursors. This study is the first report of an enzyme defect related only to unsaturated fatty acid oxidation and provides the first in vivo evidence that fat oxidation in humans proceeds by the reductase-dependent pathway. The patient was a black female, presenting in the neonatal period with persistent hypotonia. Biochemical studies revealed hyperlysinemia, hypocarnitinemia, normal organic acid profile, and an unusual acylcarnitine species in both urine and blood. The new metabolite was positively identified by mass spectrometry as 2-trans,4-cis-decadienoylcarnitine, derived from incomplete oxidation of linoleic acid. In spite of dietary therapy, the patient died of respiratory acidosis at four months of age. Samples of liver and muscle from the autopsy were assayed for 2,4-dienoyl-coenzyme A reductase activity. Using the substrate 2-trans,4-cis-decadienoylcoenzyme A, the reductase activity was 40% of the control value in liver and only 17% of that found in normal muscle. It is suggested that unsaturated substrates should be used for in vitro testing to cover the full range of potential beta-oxidation defects and that acylcarnitine species identification be used for in vivo detection of this disorder.
Document 15 (Title: Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase): Acyl-CoA dehydrogenases (ACADs) are a class of enzymes that function to catalyze the initial step in each cycle of fatty acid β-oxidation in the mitochondria of cells. Their action results in the introduction of a trans double-bond between C2 (α) and C3 (β) of the acyl-CoA thioester substrate. Flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) is a required co-factor in addition to the presence of an active site glutamate in order for the enzyme to function. The following reaction is the oxidation of the fatty acid by FAD to afford an α,β-unsaturated fatty acid thioester of Coenzyme A: ACADs can be categorized into three distinct groups based on their specificity for short-, medium-, or long-chain fatty acid acyl-CoA substrates. While different dehydrogenases target fatty acids of varying chain length, all types of ACADs are mechanistically similar. Differences in the enzyme occur based on the location of the active site along the amino acid sequence.
