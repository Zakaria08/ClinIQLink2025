We have compared this new marker, TRAP, with the classical biochemical markers of bone remodelling, serum alkaline phosphatase (sAP), serum osteocalcin (sBGP), and with the urinary hydroxyproline/creatinine ratio (uOHProl/creatinine), a routine marker of bone resorption. Serum TRAP was significantly higher in pagetic patients (n = 43) than in control subjects (n = 12) (13.02 +/- 4.7 vs 5.48 +/- 1.31 IU/L, P less than 0.001) and a significantly positive linear correlation was found between the sTRAP and uOHProl/creatinine ratio (y = 0.0051x - 0.0069, r = 0.82, P less than 0.001), between sTRAP and sAP (y = 19.3x - 85.0, r = 0.71, P less than 0.001) and also between sTRAP and sBGP (y = 0.02x + 2.23, r = 0.52, P less than 0.01). Serum TRAP levels were higher than the upper limit of normality in all our pagetic patients except for two, whose uOHProl/creatinine levels were in the normal range. We conclude that (1) sTRAP could be a parameter as sensitive as uOHProl/creatinine in the diagnosis of Paget's disease; (2) sTRAP and uOHProl/creatinine are both good markers of bone resorption; (3) the correlation found between sTRAP and formation markers (sAP and sBGP) makes sTRAP a marker of disease activity in Paget's disease of bone; (4) the assay of sTRAP is easier, faster, and of lower cost than the urinary hydroxyproline determination.
