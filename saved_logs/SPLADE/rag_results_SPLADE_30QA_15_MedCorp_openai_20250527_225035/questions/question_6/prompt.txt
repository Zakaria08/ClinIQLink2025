Document 1 (Title: Etomidate): Pharmacokinetics At the typical dose, anesthesia is induced for the duration of about 5–10 minutes, though the half-life of drug metabolism is about 75 minutes, because etomidate is redistributed from the plasma to other tissues. Onset of action: 30–60 seconds Peak effect: 1 minute Duration: 3–5 minutes; terminated by redistribution Distribution: Vd: 2–4.5 L/kg Protein binding: 76% Metabolism: Hepatic and plasma esterases Half-life distribution: 2.7 minutes Half-life redistribution: 29 minutes Half-life elimination: 2.9 to 5.3 hours Metabolism Etomidate is highly protein-bound in blood plasma and is metabolised by hepatic and plasma esterases to inactive products. It exhibits a biexponential decline.
Document 2 (Title: [Studies on buffalo milk. XI. Heterogeneity of the buffalo k-casein and the less moving fractions treated with 2-mercaptoethanol (author's transl)].): The heterogeneity of the buffalo k-casein, treated with 2-mercaptoethanol, has been estimated by disk gel-polyacrylamide electrophoresis on 428 caseins isolated from individual milks. The investigation showed six electrophoretic fractions: A, B, C, D, E, F, that, in ten buffalo farms considered formed ten different groups: ABCDEF; ABCDE; ABCEF; ABCE; BCDE; CDEF; BCE; CDE; CEF; and CE. The group ABCDE is the only that is present in all ten farms considered and presents on the whole, the greater number of observations (161). The fraction C is the most abundant. The investigation showed the heterogeneity of the gamma fraction, showing five electrophoretic fractions: A, B, C, D, E, that constitute the nine following groups; ABCDE; ABCD; BCDE; ABD; BCD; ABC; BD; BC and AB. At present a possible correlation to genetic factors seems hazardous.
Document 3 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): These opioids differ mainly in their potency and biodisposition. Sufentanil is five to seven times more potent than fentanyl. Alfentanil is considerably less potent than fentanyl, but acts more rapidly and has a markedly shorter duration of action. Remifentanil is metabolized very rapidly by blood and nonspecific tissue esterases, making its pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic half-lives extremely short. Such properties are useful when these compounds are used in anesthesia practice. Although fentanyl is now the predominant analgesic in the phenylpiperidine class, meperidine continues to be used. This older opioid has significant antimuscarinic effects, which may be a contraindication if tachycardia would be a problem. Meperidine is also reported to have a negative inotropic action on the heart. In addition, it has the potential for producing seizures secondary to accumulation of its metabolite, normeperidine, in patients receiving high doses or with concurrent renal failure. Given
Document 4 (Title: Relative Risk -- Issues of Concern): The odds ratio compares the odds of some event in an exposed group versus the odds in a non-exposed group and is calculated as the number of events / the number of non-events. Stated another way, if the probability of an event is P, then the odds ratio would be P / (1 – P).  In a two-by-two table with cells a, b, c, and d then the odds ratio is odds of the event in the exposure group (a/b) divided by the odds of the event in the control or non-exposure group (c/d). Thus the odds ratio is (a/b) / (c/d) which simplifies to ad/bc. This is compared to the relative risk which is (a / (a+b)) / (c / (c+d)). If the disease condition (event) is rare, then the odds ratio and relative risk may be comparable, but the odds ratio will overestimate the risk if the disease is more common.  In such cases, the odds ratio should be avoided, and the relative risk will be a more accurate estimation of risk. See Table. Calculations of Relative Risk and Odds Ratio, 2 x 2 Table.
Document 5 (Title: Odds Ratio -- Issues of Concern): The odds ratio can be confused with relative risk.  As stated above, the odds ratio is a ratio of 2 odds. As odds of an event are always positive, the odds ratio is always positive and ranges from zero to very large. The relative risk is a ratio of probabilities of the event occurring in all exposed individuals versus the event occurring in all non-exposed individuals. In a 2-by-2 table with cells a, b, c, and d (see figure), the odds ratio is odds of the event in the exposure group (a/b) divided by the odds of the event in the control or non-exposure group (c/d). Thus the odds ratio is (a/b) / (c/d) which simplifies to ad/bc.  This is compared to the relative risk which is (a / (a+b)) / (c / (c+d)).  If the disease condition (event) is rare, then the odds ratio and relative risk may be comparable, but the odds ratio will overestimate the risk if the disease is more common.  In such cases, the odds ratio should be avoided, and the relative risk will be a more accurate estimation of risk. [3] Commonly, odds ratios will be reported in case-control studies, in which relative risks cannot be calculated.
Document 6 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): 1. Potency—Drugs A and B are said to be more potent than drugs C and D because of the relative positions of their dose-response curves along the dose axis of Figure 2–15. Potency refers to the concentration (EC50) or dose (ED50) of a drug required to produce 50% of that drug’s maximal effect. Thus, the pharmacologic potency of drug A in Figure 2–15 is less than that of drug B, a partial agonist because the EC50 of A is greater than the EC50 of B. Potency of a drug depends in part on the affinity (Kd) of receptors for binding the drug and in part on the efficiency with which drug-receptor interaction is coupled to response. Note that some doses of drug A can produce larger effects than any dose of drug B, despite the fact that we describe drug B as pharmacologically more potent. The reason for this is that drug A has a larger maximal efficacy (as described below).
Document 7 (Title: Malignant Melanoma -- History and Physical): The characteristic signs of early melanoma are recognized with the following well-known ABCDE mnemonic: “ A ” stands for A symmetry “ B ” stands for B order: irregular, ragged, notched, or blurred edges “ C ” stands for C olor: nonuniform or variegated “ D ” stands for D iameter: larger than 6 millimeters “ E ” stands for E volving : changes in size, shape, or color [25]
Document 8 (Title: Metastatic Melanoma -- History and Physical): The characteristic signs of early melanoma are recognized with the well-known ABCDE mnemonic as follows: “ A ” stands for A symmetry “ B ” stands for B order: irregular, ragged, notched, or blurred edges “ C ” stands for C olor: nonuniform or variegated “ D ” stands for D iameter: larger than 6 millimeters “ E ” stands for E volving : changes in size, shape, or color [26]
Document 9 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): B. Structure-Activity Characteristics of Local Anesthetics The smaller and more highly lipophilic local anesthetics have a faster rate of interaction with the sodium channel receptor. As previously noted, potency is also positively correlated with lipid solubility. Lidocaine, procaine, and mepivacaine are more water soluble than tetracaine, bupivacaine, and ropivacaine. The latter agents are more potent and have longer durations of local anesthetic action. These long-acting local anesthetics also bind more extensively to proteins and can be displaced from these binding sites by other protein-bound drugs. In the case of optically active agents (eg, bupivacaine), the R(+) isomer can usually be shown to be slightly more potent than the S(–) isomer (levobupivacaine). C. Neuronal Factors Affecting Block 1.
Document 10 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): Acetohexamide is no longer available in the United States. Its half-life is only about 1 hour but its more active metabolite, hydroxyhexamide, has a half-life of 4–6 hours; thus the drug duration of action is 8–24 hours. Where available, its dosage is 0.25–1.5 g/d as single dose or in two divided doses. Chlorpropamide, tolazamide, and acetohexamide are now rarely used in clinical practice. Glyburide, glipizide, gliclazide, and glimepiride are 100–200 times more potent than tolbutamide. They should be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular disease or in elderly patients, in whom hypoglycemia would be especially dangerous.
Document 11 (Title: Maturational changes and origin of urinary human epidermal growth factor in the neonatal period.): In order to clarify the characteristics of urinary human epidermal growth factor (hEGF) excretion in the newborn period, we examined hEGF in the 41 newborn infants; 12 healthy preterm infants (group A), 10 healthy full-term infants (group B), 12 full-term infants with neonatal asphyxia (group C), 7 full-term infants treated with tobramycin (group D) during the first week of life. Renal function tests, i.e. creatinine clearance (Ccr), and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) as a parameter of renal tubular damage, were examined in 29 full-term infants. Urinary hEGF excretion showed a linear increase with gestational age. During the first week of life, urinary hEGF excretion in group B increased with age. However, urinary hEGF excretion in group A remained at the constant level through the study period. Ccr in group C was significantly decreased through the study period when compared with that in group B. NAG indices in group C during the first week of life and those in group D on days 5-7 of life were more elevated than those in group B. Urinary hEGF excretion in group C on days 4-7 of life and that in group D on day 7 of life were significantly decreased when compared with that in group B. These results suggest that urinary hEGF excretion is related to the maturation and that the source of urinary hEGF may be renal tubular cells.
Document 12 (Title: [Coalition tactics of the weaks in the power struggle].): This study was intended to investigate the coalition tactics of the weaks under the situation where four players in the power relationship such as "A greater than B = C = D, A less than (B + C + D)" struggled for new resources of power. Subjects were 128 male undergraduates divided into 32 groups of four members each. The experimental design was 2 (determinants of power strength; resource size or rank order) x 2 (range of power distance between the strong and the weaks; large or small). As the result, it was revealed that the weaks preferred revolutional coalition "BCD" under the condition where the resource size determined the power strength, while preferred getting-ahead coalition "AB, AC, AD" under the condition where the rank order determined, and that expansion of power distance reinforced such tendency of the weaks. It was also shown, however, that the weaks did not always form the coalitions as they had hoped before bargaining. In conclusion, the necessity to examine the characteristics of the weaks' mentalities and behaviors in coalition bargaining was suggested.
Document 13 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): The kidney appears to play an important role in its metabolism and excretion. Somatostatin has limited therapeutic usefulness because of its short duration of action and multiple effects in many secretory systems. A series of longer-acting somatostatin analogs that retain biologic activity have been developed. Octreotide, the most widely used somatostatin analog (Figure 37–2), is 45 times more potent than somatostatin in inhibiting GH release but only twice as potent in reducing insulin secretion. Because of this relatively reduced effect on pancreatic beta cells, hyperglycemia rarely occurs during treatment. The plasma elimination half-life of octreotide is about 80 minutes, 30 times longer than that of somatostatin.
Document 14 (Title: Neurology_Adams): A. Complete: No sensory or motor function below the level of the lesion including in the sacral segments. B. Sensory incomplete: Sensory function is preserved but motor function is lost below the zone of injury. C. Motor incomplete (first grade): Motor function is reduced in more than half of key muscles below the level of the lesion; this usually renders the patient unable to walk. (Reduced motor function is defined as active movement in a full range of motion only if gravity is eliminated.) D. Motor incomplete (second grade): Motor function is reduced in fewer than half of key muscles below the level of the lesion; this usually allows standing and walking. E. Normal: Reflexes may be abnormal. Obviously, groups C, D, and E have a more favorable prognosis for recovery of ambulation than does groups A and B. Even minimal preserved of sensation at the outset of injury (grade B), which is usually in the perineum, is associated with a better outcome than AIS grade A.
