Document 1 (Title: Prostate Cancer -- Medical Oncology -- Aggressive Prostate Cancer): Aggressive disease in prostate cancer is typically defined as either locally advanced, a higher Gleason score (Gleason 4+4=8 or higher), or a rapid PSA doubling time of 10 months or less. Treatment for aggressive prostate cancers may involve radical prostatectomy, radiation therapy, HIFU, cryosurgery, hormonal therapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, radiopharmaceuticals, or some combination of these. Early use of combinatorial therapies is helpful in many patients presenting with aggressive or advanced, localized disease. [26] [296] [321]
Document 2 (Title: Treatment of localized prostatic cancer.): Discovery of a localized prostatic cancer frequently creates a therapeutic dilemma. A significant number of patients do well for an extended period of time without treatment, while others suffer rapid tumor progression and death from prostatic cancer. Without treatment nearly one third of patients with stage B prostatic cancer can be expected to develop distant metastatic disease or death from prostatic cancer within 10 years. In patients who otherwise have a reasonable life expectancy of 10 years or more, aggressive therapy is justified. Long-term disease-free survival has been reported after both radical prostatectomy and external irradiation. The fact that nearly 50% of patients treated with external irradiation for stage B prostatic cancer have positive postirradiation biopsies is of concern, but the impact of this finding on overall survival is yet to be determined. The only randomized prospective study comparing radical prostatectomy with external irradiation showed a statistically significant decrease in the time to Nevertheless, as evidenced by the National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Panel, further randomized prospective trials are needed to determine the relative value of radical prostatectomy versus external irradiation for localized prostatic cancer. For the forseeable future, definitive scientific data on which to base treatment recommendations will not be available. Therefore, patients should be well informed of the various treatment options available, and the wishes of the patient are paramount. The clinician's roles are to interpret the data, present it in a meaningful manner to patients, be guided in discussions by patient preferences, and make recommendations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Document 3 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): boney structures. Modern CT PET scans have a limited role at this point.Treatment for localized prostate cancer is guided by can-cer aggressiveness and patient’s preferences. Active sur-veillance is recommended for patients with low-risk disease grade 1–2, early-stage disease (cT1c), and small volume disease as determined by biopsy. Large prospective cohorts and randomized clinical trials have established the safety of this approach.134,135 The risk of progression to metastatic disease with close follow-up and repeat prostate biopsies is less than 2% in over 12 years. Radical prostatectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection (robotic, laparoscopic, or open), image modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), and brachytherapy are the standard of care for curative treatments. All provide equal cancer specific survival for low and intermediate risk cancers. For higher risk prostate cancer patients, both surgery and IMRT with androgen 8Figure 40-11.

Document 4 (Title: Pathology_Robbins): The relatively low rate of mortality in men with prostate cancer is related in part to increased detection of the disease through screening (discussed later), but how effective screening is at saving lives is controversial. This seeming paradox is related to the wide variation in the natural history of prostate cancer, from aggressive and rapidly fatal to indolent disease of no clinical significance. Indeed, prostate carcinoma commonly is found incidentally at autopsy in men dying of other causes, and many more men die with prostate cancer than of prostate cancer. It is not currently possible to identify the tumors that will be “bad actors” with certainty; thus, while some men are no doubt saved by early detection and treatment of their prostate cancers, it is equally certain that others are being “cured” of clinically inconsequential tumors.
Document 5 (Title: 5α-Reductase inhibitor): Mild-to-moderate benign prostatic hyperplasia and lower urinary tract symptoms Pattern hair loss in both men and women 5-ARIs can be used in the treatment of hirsutism in women. The usefulness of 5-ARIs for the potential treatment of acne is uncertain. 5-ARIs are sometimes used as antiandrogens in feminizing hormone therapy for transgender women to help reduce body hair growth and scalp hair loss. They have also been explored in the treatment and prevention of prostate cancer. While the 5-ARI finasteride reduces the cancer risk by about a third, it also increases the fraction of aggressive forms of prostate cancer. Overall, there does not seem to be a survival benefit for prostate cancer patients under finasteride.
Document 6 (Title: Biochemical recurrence): Biochemical recurrence is a rise in the blood level of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in prostate cancer patients after treatment with surgery or radiation. Biochemical recurrence may occur in patients who do not have symptoms. It may mean that the cancer has come back. Also called PSA failure and biochemical relapse. It is used to detect metastatic progression of the prostate cancer.

Document 7 (Title: The risk of dying of prostate cancer in patients with clinically localized disease.): From 1966 to 1979, 360 patients with clinical stages A2, B and C1 prostate cancer underwent staging pelvic lymphadenectomy, and completed a course of combined interstitial radioactive gold seeds and external beam radiotherapy. All patients had a normal serum prostatic acid phosphatase level and a bone scan negative for metastases. All patients were followed until death or for a mean of 7.3 years (range 1.2 to 18.25 years) for those alive at analysis. To determine the risk of dying of prostate cancer we reviewed the records of the 142 patients (39%) who died. At analysis 21% of the patients had died of prostate cancer and 17% of other known causes. The cause of death could not be determined in 4 patients (1%). Cardiovascular disease accounted for a fifth of all deaths. The actuarial risk of death of prostate cancer for all patients was 8 +/- 3% (+/- 2 standard errors) at 5 years and 30 +/- 7% at 10 years. The risk of death of all causes was 16 +/- 4% at 5 years and 46 +/- 7% at 10 years. An increased risk of cancer death was associated with established risk factors, including advanced local disease, poorly differentiated histology, pelvic nodal metastases and distant recurrence. We also noted a substantial risk of cancer death in patients who had local tumor recurrence. While previous studies have reported a relatively low incidence of cancer deaths (4 to 17%) in patients initially diagnosed with localized disease, our data suggest that prostate cancer is the major cause of mortality in such patients. Aggressive curative therapy, regardless of treatment modality, should be considered for localized prostate cancer in men with a life expectancy of 10 or more years.
Document 8 (Title: Prostate cancer): Active surveillance involves monitoring the tumor for growth or symptoms, which trigger treatment. The monitoring process may involve PSA tests, digital rectal examination, or repeated biopsies every few months. The goal of active surveillance is to postpone treatment, and avoid overtreatment and its side effects, given a slow-growing or self-limited tumor that in most people is unlikely to cause problems. This approach is not used for aggressive cancers, and may cause anxiety for people who wrongly believe that all cancers are deadly or that their condition is life-threatening. Between 50 and 75% of patients die from other causes without experiencing prostate symptoms. In localized disease, based on long-term follow-up, radical prostatectomy results in significantly improved oncological outcomes when compared with watchful waiting. Prostatectomy is associated with increased rates of urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction, but these findings are based primarily on men
Document 9 (Title: Prostate Cancer -- Evaluation -- Genomic (Somatic) Tumor Biomarkers (Post-Biopsy)): Prolaris test: This test was the first commercially available genomic tumor marker to evaluate prostate cancer aggressiveness. [217] The Prolaris test analyzes 46 genes and specifically measures the RNA expression of 31 genes involved in cell cycle progression. The test is designed to indicate the risk of biochemical recurrence and prostate cancer-specific mortality over the next 10 years when combined with the PSA level, clinical stage, percentage of positive biopsy cores, biopsy grade group, and AUA risk group. [212] In a large prospective registry, the Prolaris test changed the initial treatment selection in 47.8% of 1600 participants, with 75% opting for a less aggressive therapy and 25% choosing a more definitive treatment option. [218] The test is most useful in facilitating decision-making for individuals with localized disease and low- or intermediate-risk cancers (both favorable and unfavorable) who are considering active surveillance versus definitive treatment. Prolaris can identify cancer-specific mortality for men on active surveillance and with biochemical recurrence for those who have had radiation therapy or undergone TURP surgery. [144] [212] Similar to the Decipher test, the Prolaris test is also useful in patients after radical prostatectomy surgery and in high-risk cases for prognostic purposes. [212]
Document 10 (Title: New concepts in the treatment of stage D1 adenocarcinoma of the prostate.): Stage D1 disease will be encountered in 20 per cent of patients by those who treat prostate cancer. There is marked heterogeneity among cancers discovered at this stage, with 5-year disease-free survival rates ranging from 0 to 95 per cent. Generally, when prostate cancer has escaped the confines of the gland, metastasis occurs, and widespread systemic disease prevails. Any significant chance for long-term cure will then depend on systemic therapy. From maturing data in retrospective reviews, preliminary data from prospective trials, and recent well-conducted animal studies, chemotherapy and hormonal deprivation appear most effective when tumor volumes are the smallest. This evidence supports the removal of all cancer possible and the early institution of systemic treatment. Caution must be exercised in extrapolating the aforementioned evidence to include cases of more extensive prostate cancer (i.e., patients with bulky pelvic or retroperitoneal disease, distant metastasis, or significant elevation of serum markers). It is doubtful that "debulking" with removal of the prostate and lymph nodes will provide any justifiable advantages in these patients. Whether removal of the prostate affords any local palliative benefit is an issue for debate. Certainly, the primary tumor, if left untreated, will progress locally and cause symptoms necessitating further procedures in more than half these patients, whereas the incidence of local recurrence and the adverse effects of these recurrences in patients with D1 disease after radical prostatectomy and adjuvant therapy is less than 10 per cent. Surgical refinements coupled with acceptably low morbidity now associated with radical prostatectomy have led some authors to endorse the palliative benefits of removing the primary tumor in selected patients. The purpose of this article is not to endorse or disparage the aggressive treatment of patients with stage D1 prostate cancer. The evidence suggests that if long-term survival is the endpoint used to compare treatment groups, then to date no treatment option offers significant advantages. On the contrary, if progression rates or disease-free survival are compared, then cytoreductive surgery and early systemic adjuvant treatment (testosterone deprivation or chemotherapy) provides significant advantages for selected patients with stage D1 disease. Although ploidy analysis, receptor mapping, and oncogene assays are promising, today, there is no practical way to identify patients who will benefit most from multimodality treatment approaches.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
Document 11 (Title: High-intensity focused ultrasound): The first commercial HIFU machine, called the Sonablate 200, was developed by the Focal Surgery and launched in Europe in 1994 after receiving CE approval, bringing a first medical validation of the technology for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Comprehensive studies by practitioners at more than one site using the device demonstrated clinical efficacy for the destruction of prostatic tissue without surgical loss of blood or long term side effects. Later studies on localized prostate cancer by Murat and colleagues at the Edouard Herriot Hospital in Lyon in 2006 showed that after treatment with the Ablatherm (EDAP TMS, Lyon, France)?, progression-free survival rates are very high for low- and intermediate- risk patients with recurrent prostate cancer (70% and 50% respectively) HIFU treatment of prostate cancer is currently an approved therapy in Europe, Canada, South Korea, Australia. , clinical trials for the Sonablate 500 in the United States are ongoing for prostate cancer
Document 12 (Title: Prostate cancer screening): Screening with PSA has been associated with a number of harms including over-diagnosis, increased prostate biopsy with associated harms, increased anxiety, and unneeded treatment. The evidence surrounding prostate cancer screening indicates that it may cause little to no difference in mortality. On the other hand, up to 25% of men diagnosed in their 70s or even 80s die of prostate cancer, if they have high-grade (i.e., aggressive) prostate cancer. Conversely, some argue against PSA testing for men who are too young, because too many men would have to be screened to find one cancer, and too many men would have treatment for cancer that would not progress. Low-risk prostate cancer does not always require immediate treatment, but may be amenable to active surveillance. A PSA test cannot 'prove' the existence of prostate cancer by itself; varying levels of the antigen can be due to other causes.
Document 13 (Title: Racial differences in prostate-specific antigen levels in patients with local-regional prostate cancer.): Prostate cancer is a significant health problem for blacks. The incidence and mortality rates are higher in blacks than in whites; blacks often present with a higher stage. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is a very useful serum marker in prostate cancer. We analyzed data from a cohort of 161 patients to determine whether there were any racial differences in PSA levels prior to treatment in local-regional prostate cancer. The immunoradiometric method was used to determine the PSA values. The mean PSA levels were significantly higher in blacks than in whites (P = 0.022), and the difference remained significant in multivariate analysis after adjusting for stage and grade (P = 0.020). However, when analyzed further, the difference was statistically significant in one hospital (P = 0.001) and not in another (P = 0.493). Thus, our results are not unequivocal, but our data do suggest that racial differences in PSA levels not accounted for by tumor stage or grade may exist. Assuming that the data truly reflect a racial difference, the cause(s) of this difference remains to be determined. It may exist because, within each clinical stage, blacks are presenting with a higher tumor cell burden, or it may be indicative of more aggressive biological behavior. The possibility that racial differences are due to socioeconomic factors was considered by estimating median income level from zip code of residence; although a correlation between socioeconomic status and PSA level was found, racial differences remained borderline significant (P = 0.055) after adjusting for income level (in addition to stage and grade).
Document 14 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Cancer gene therapies can be divided into local and systemic approaches (Table 91e-3). Some of the earliest cancer gene therapy trials focused on local delivery of a prodrug or a suicide gene that would increase sensitivity of tumor cells to cytotoxic drugs. A frequently used strategy has been intratumoral injection of an adenoviral vector expressing the thymidine kinase (TK) gene. Cells that take up and express the TK gene can be killed after the administration of ganciclovir, which is phosphorylated to a toxic nucleoside by TK. Because cell division is required for the toxic nucleoside to affect cell viability, this strategy was initially used in aggressive brain tumors (glioblastoma multiforme) where the cycling tumor cells were affected but the nondividing normal neurons were not. More recently, this approach has been explored for locally recurrent prostate, breast, and colon tumors, among others.
Document 15 (Title: Localized Prostate Cancer -- Introduction): Men with low-grade tumors rarely die from prostate cancer. They are much more likely to die from other causes first. On the other hand, men with high-grade disease are more likely to die from prostate cancer within ten years without radical treatment. The prognosis of men with intermediate-risk cancer is the most difficult to predict. The perceived increased risk of mortality compared to low-risk disease can often push clinicians towards radical treatment in these cases. Still, such a strategy has been challenged by the findings of studies such as the ProtecT study of treatments for localized prostate cancer. Prognostic markers and scoring will likely be of great interest to this group of patients. [8]
