Document 1 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): 982 Listeria monocytogenes Infections Elizabeth L. Hohmann, Daniel A. Portnoy Listeria monocytogenes is a food-borne pathogen that can cause serious infections, particularly in pregnant women and immunocompromised 176 individuals. A ubiquitous saprophytic environmental bacterium, L. monocytogenes is also a facultative intracellular pathogen with a broad host range. Humans are probably accidental hosts for this microorganism. L. monocytogenes is of interest not only to clinicians but also to basic scientists as a model intracellular pathogen that is used to study basic mechanisms of microbial pathogenesis and host immunity. L. monocytogenes is a facultatively anaerobic, nonsporulating, gram-positive rod that grows over a broad temperature range, including refrigeration temperatures. This organism is motile during growth at low temperatures but much less so at 37°C. The vast majority of cases of human listerial disease can be traced to serotypes 1/2a, 1/2b, and 4.
Document 2 (Title: Western blot analysis of the antibody response in patients with Listeria monocytogenes meningitis and septicemia.): The antibody response in patients with Listeria monocytogenes septicemia and/or meningitis was investigated using Western blot analysis (WBA). Protein antigen preparations were produced from two strains of Listeria monocytogenes, representing serogroup 1 and 4, by sonication and differential centrifugation. IgG antibodies from 8 (50%) of 16 patients with culture verified septicemia and/or meningitis due to Listeria monocytogenes reacted with a 93 kDa antigen from serogroup 1, in contrast to IgG antibodies from only 1 (2%) of 51 controls; these controls represented 21 patients with infections caused by other bacteria and 30 apparently healthy blood donors. Furthermore, IgM antibodies from 3 (19%) of the patients with listeric infections bound to a 106 kDa protein antigen in contrast to none of the controls. In 3 (33%) of 9 patients from whom acute and convalescence serum were available, the patients responded by producing antibodies against new protein antigens. Current methods used in routine serological investigations, i.e. complement fixation and O-agglutination tests, were positive in only 4 (24%) of the 16 patients with listeriosis. The results point to the possibility of designing new immunoassays for detection of septicemia and meningitis caused by Listeria monocytogenes.
Document 3 (Title: Listeria monocytogenes): Listeria monocytogenes is a Gram-positive bacterium, in the division Firmicutes, named after Joseph Lister. Its ability to grow at temperatures as low as 0 °C permits multiplication at typical refrigeration temperatures, greatly increasing its ability to evade control in human foodstuffs. Motile via flagella at 30 °C and below, but usually not at 37 °C, L. monocytogenes can instead move within eukaryotic cells by explosive polymerization of actin filaments (known as comet tails or actin rockets). Studies suggest up to 10% of human gastrointestinal tracts may be colonized by L. monocytogenes. Nevertheless, clinical diseases due to L. monocytogenes are more frequently recognized by veterinarians, especially as meningoencephalitis in ruminants. See: listeriosis in animals.
Document 4 (Title: Listeria monocytogenes): The Anton test is used in the identification of L. monocytogenes; instillation of a culture into the conjunctival sac of a rabbit or guinea pig causes severe keratoconjunctivitis within 24 hours. Listeria species grow on media such as Mueller-Hinton agar. Identification is enhanced if the primary cultures are done on agar containing sheep blood, because the characteristic small zone of hemolysis can be observed around and under colonies. Isolation can be enhanced if the tissue is kept at 4 °C for some days before inoculation into bacteriologic media. The organism is a facultative anaerobe and is catalase-positive and motile. Listeria produces acid, but not gas, when fermenting a variety of carbohydrates. The motility at room temperature and hemolysin production are primary findings that help differentiate Listeria from Corynebacterium.
Document 5 (Title: Listeria Monocytogenes -- Etiology): Listeria commonly causes meningitis in the young (neonates), elderly, and immunocompromised patient population. Healthy individuals infected with L. monocytogenes typically have a self-limiting gastrointestinal infection with fever and diarrhea. The Listeria family consists of 10 different species with L. monocytogenes found most consistently in humans. L. monocytogenes has 13 different serotypes based on a variety of flagellar and surface antigens.  However, there are only three serotypes (1/2a, 1/2b, 4a) that inflict disease in humans. [3] In general, the infectious dose of L. monocytogenes is large, meaning one must ingest a large number to cause clinical infection, but as growth and division can continue at refrigerator temperatures, these levels can be reached despite typical food storage precautions. Host immune response also affects the infectious dose. Utilization of proton pump inhibitors or other stomach acid suppression modalities makes it easier for L. monocytogenes to pass through the stomach and invade enterocytes.
Document 6 (Title: Growth of Listeria monocytogenes Scott A, serotype 4 and competitive spoilage organisms in raw chicken packaged under modified atmospheres and in air.): The development of Listeria monocytogenes Scott A, serotype 4 and aerobic plate counts on minced raw chicken were determined independently at 4, 10 and 27 degrees C. Samples were packaged in flexible film under two modified atmospheres (one containing oxygen and one containing no oxygen) or air. The anaerobic modified atmosphere (75:25, CO2:N2) resulted in the failure of both the aerobic plate counts and L. monocytogenes to grow at all temperatures. Both the L. monocytogenes and aerobic plate counts grew in air at all temperatures. The aerobic modified atmosphere (72.5:22.5:5, CO2:N2:O2), which more closely duplicates commercial practice, inhibited the increase in aerobic plate counts by more than 4 log10 cfu/g compared to air at 4 degrees C. However, the L. monocytogenes was not affected by this atmosphere and increased in numbers by nearly 6 log10 cfu/g at 4 degrees C in 21 days. Regression analysis of the log10 growth and 95% confidence intervals showed that the differences between aerobic plate counts and L. monocytogenes in modified atmosphere were large. The ability of L. monocytogenes to grow in the aerobic modified atmosphere was not affected by level of the L. monocytogenes inoculum nor by the initial level of aerobic plate counts. These data show that modified atmosphere packaging of raw chicken (and probably other meats) can substantially inhibit the aerobic spoilage flora while allowing pathogenic L. monocytogenes to increase.
Document 7 (Title: Listeria Monocytogenes -- Pathophysiology): Once the infection has occurred, L. monocytogenes can cause amnionitis, sepsis, spontaneous abortion in pregnant women, granulomatosis infantiseptica, and meningitis. Healthy individuals infected with L. monocytogenes typically have self-limiting gastroenteritis with diarrhea and vomiting.
Document 8 (Title: Listeria monocytogenes): Routes of infection Listeria monocytogenes has been associated with such foods as raw milk, pasteurized fluid milk, cheeses (particularly soft-ripened varieties), hard-boiled eggs, ice cream, raw vegetables, fermented raw-meat sausages, raw and cooked poultry, raw meats (of all types), and raw and smoked fish. Most bacteria can survive near freezing temperatures, but cannot absorb nutrients, grow or replicate; however, L. monocytogenes has the ability to grow at temperatures as low as 0 °C which permits exponential multiplication in refrigerated foods. At refrigeration temperature, such as 4 °C, the amount of ferric iron can affect the growth of L. monocytogenes. Infectious cycle
Document 9 (Title: Fever in a Neonate -- Treatment / Management): The ill-appearing neonate requires a full septic work and broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage with ampicillin and cefotaxime, the combination of which covers 100% of early neonatal infections and 93% of late-onset bacteremia. Gentamicin and penicillin can cover 94% of early infections. [9] Cefotaxime does not treat some Escherichia coli , Pseudomonas , Enterococci , Acinetobacter, and Listeria monocytogenes . Use of Cefotaxime in the NICU can cause outbreaks of drug-resistant nosocomial infections, which is a serious concern in many centers. Pediatric Infectious diseases specialists consider empiric treatment of neonatal herpes with Intravenous Acyclovir if the CSF has an elevated red cell count or in any ill-looking neonate with suspected herpes. [10] We admit and empirically treat ill-looking infants and infants with risk factors while waiting for the cultures.
Document 10 (Title: Bacterial Meningitis -- Etiology): Listeria monocytogenes and gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli , Klebsiella , Enterobacter , Pseudomonas aeruginosa are other less common causes. Hemophilus influenzae is still occasionally encountered in nonvaccinated individuals. Nosocomial infections are caused by S. pneumonia , Staphylococcus aureus , Staphylococcus albus , and gram-negative bacilli. As per Thigpen etal. out of the 1670 cases reported in the U.S. during 2003–2007, S. pneumoniae was the predominant infective species (58.0%), followed by GBS (18.1%), N. meningitidis (13.9%), H. influenzae (6.7%), and L. monocytogenes (3.4%). [4] Infectious meningitis may also be caused by viruses, fungi, and protozoa. Meningitis may also be non-infectious in etiology and can be caused by cancer, medications, or inflammatory conditions. [5] [6]
Document 11 (Title: Listeriosis): Central nervous system (CNS) infection: Listeria has a predilection for the brain parenchyma, especially the brain stem, and the meninges. It can cause cranial nerve palsies, encephalitis, meningitis, meningoencephalitis and abscesses. Mental status changes are common. Seizures occur in at least 25% of patients. Gastroenteritis: L. monocytogenes can produce food-borne diarrheal disease, which typically is noninvasive. The median incubation period is 21 days, with diarrhea lasting anywhere from 1–3 days. Affected people present with fever, muscle aches, gastrointestinal nausea or diarrhea, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance, or convulsions.
Document 12 (Title: Listeria monocytogenes, a food-borne pathogen.): The gram-positive bacterium Listeria monocytogenes is an ubiquitous, intracellular pathogen which has been implicated within the past decade as the causative organism in several outbreaks of foodborne disease. Listeriosis, with a mortality rate of about 24%, is found mainly among pregnant women, their fetuses, and immunocompromised persons, with symptoms of abortion, neonatal death, septicemia, and meningitis. Epidemiological investigations can make use of strain-typing procedures such as DNA restriction enzyme analysis or electrophoretic enzyme typing. The organism has a multifactorial virulence system, with the thiol-activated hemolysin, listeriolysin O, being identified as playing a crucial role in the organism's ability to multiply within host phagocytic cells and to spread from cell to cell. The organism occurs widely in food, with the highest incidences being found in meat, poultry, and seafood products. Improved methods for detecting and enumerating the organism in foodstuffs are now available, including those based on the use of monoclonal antibodies, DNA probes, or the polymerase chain reaction. As knowledge of the molecular and applied biology of L. monocytogenes increases, progress can be made in the prevention and control of human infection.
Document 13 (Title: Listeria Monocytogenes -- Pathophysiology): L. monocytogenes can grow at refrigerator temperatures.  Low temperatures induce enzymes such as RNA helicase which improves L. monocytogenes’ activity and replication at low temperatures. The ability to produce biofilms enhances L. monocytogenes ability to survive harsh environments. L. monocytogenes also utilizes flagella at lower temperatures. This mechanism enables the ability to propel itself and latch onto enterocytes early in infection, but eventually losing the flagella the longer the bacteria is exposed to higher temperatures.
Document 14 (Title: Roles of Listeria monocytogenes virulence factors in survival: virulence factors distinct from listeriolysin are needed for the organism to survive an early neutrophil-mediated host defense mechanism.): Avirulent mutant strains of Listeria monocytogenes which fail to produce phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C, or which produce reduced amounts of hemolytic listeriolysin O, are incapable of causing progressive infection in normal mice. However, both strains can grow progressively in mice that have been rendered incapable of focusing neutrophils at sites of infection as a result of being treated with monoclonal antibody 5C6, specific for the type 3 complement receptor of myelomonocytic cells. In 5C6-treated mice, phospholipase C-negative and listeriolysin-defective mutant strains of L. monocytogenes, like the wild-type strain, give rise in the liver to large numbers of discrete foci of infected hepatocytes that retain their morphological integrity during the first 24 h, despite their large bacterial burden. In normal mice, in contrast, sites of infection in the liver are indicated by discrete focal accumulations of neutrophils that occupy the space originally occupied by infected hepatocytes. It is apparent that in normal mice neutrophils function to lyse infected hepatocytes and thereby to release L. monocytogenes for ingestion and killing by neutrophils themselves and by macrophages. However, whereas a proportion of wild-type organisms survive this early mechanism of defense to give rise to progressive infection, the phospholipase C-negative organisms are totally eliminated. On the basis of these and other results, it is suggested that virulence factors other than listeriolysin are needed by L. monocytogenes to counteract the early neutrophil-mediated mechanism of defense. Listeriolysin, itself, is an intrinsic virulence factor that allows L. monocytogenes to survive and multiply in a proportion of the fixed phagocytes of the liver (permissive phagocytes) and which enables the organism to go on to infect and replicate in adjacent hepatocytes. It was found that a mutant strain of L. monocytogenes incapable of producing any listeriolysin was incapable of establishing progressive infection, even in 5C6-treated mice.
Document 15 (Title: Listeria): Listeria is a genus of bacteria that acts as an intracellular parasite in mammals. Until 1992, 10 species were known, each containing two subspecies. By 2020, 21 species had been identified. The genus is named in honor of the British pioneer of sterile surgery Joseph Lister. Listeria species are Gram-positive, rod-shaped, and facultatively anaerobic, and do not produce endospores. The major human pathogen in the genus Listeria is L. monocytogenes. It is usually the causative agent of the relatively rare bacterial disease listeriosis, an infection caused by eating food contaminated with the bacteria. Listeriosis can cause serious illness in pregnant women, newborns, adults with weakened immune systems and the elderly, and may cause gastroenteritis in others who have been severely infected.
