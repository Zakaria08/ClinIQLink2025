Retrospective study consisting of a one in three sample of all children admitted to the hospital's general medical units over one year. All admissions were listed sequentially, and every third patient was included in the study. Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne; a tertiary paediatric hospital with a major primary care role. There were a total of 660 patients eligible for inclusion in the study; 220 were selected, and all records were reviewed. It was found that although 87.7% of admissions could be justified on medical grounds alone, the children quickly recovered with at least 65% being fit for discharge within 12 hours of admission. In spite of this the mean duration of admission was 17.0 hours. The majority of patients were suffering from easily diagnosed and treated disorders, with 78.9% falling into four diagnostic groups (asthma, ingestions, infections, and convulsions). Criteria for admission to a short stay observation area were satisfied in 65% of patients (at the time of the study no such area existed in the hospital). No patients were discharged inappropriately early. A significant number of children require brief hospitalisation for relatively minor illness, but unnecessary delays caused by administrative aspects of hospital admission and relatively infrequent inpatient review by medical staff often lengthen the period of admission. Significant cost savings are possible with the use of a short stay facility, and a large number of patients are suitable for this form of care.",

Sixty-eight house staff and 16 teaching attending physicians participated during a 35-week period, taking care of 1057 eligible patients. No significant differences in charges were seen when all patients were included. Since 45% of patients had planned protocol admissions (diagnostic workups or protocol treatment) on which the house staff had little change to impact, a subgroup analysis was performed, excluding these patients. In the remaining patients, a highly significant reduction in mean total charges (17%), length of stay (18%), room charges (18%), and diagnostic testing (20%) was found. In-hospital mortality and preventable readmission within 30 days were similar on the two wards.
