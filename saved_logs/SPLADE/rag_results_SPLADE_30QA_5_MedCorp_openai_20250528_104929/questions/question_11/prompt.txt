With your own knowledge and the help of the following document:

Document 1 (Title: Assisting Patients With Personal Hygiene -- Nursing, Allied Health, and Interprofessional Team Interventions -- Bathing): Bathing in a bed can be done either with a washbasin filled with water or with prepackaged cloths that do not require water. The wipes that do not require water are known as bag baths. If using a wash bin and cloths, ensure they are single-use items to prevent the spread of bacteria. In 2017, a systematic review found that patients preferred a standard water and soap bath, but the bag bath was a useful alternative. [6] When bathing, gloves are not required, but patients may prefer the helper to use gloves. [8] When bathing elderly patients, moisturizing soaps or water and oil soaked with lotion are used to prevent dryness. [9] Bathing toiletries should be either assigned to a specific patient or single-use items to prevent the spread of infection between patients.
Document 2 (Title: Hydrotherapy): The general idea behind hydropathy during the 1800s was to be able to induce something called a crisis. The thinking was that water invaded any cracks, wounds, or imperfections in the skin, which were filled with impure fluids. Health was considered to be the natural state of the body, and filling these spaces with pure water, would flush the impurities out, which would rise to the surface of the skin, producing pus. The event of this pus emerging was called a crisis, and was achieved through a multitude of methods. These methods included techniques such as sweating, the plunging bath, the half bath, the head bath, the sitting bath, and the douche bath. All of these were ways to gently expose the patient to cold water in different ways.
Document 3 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): vascular collapse; it is distinguished from cholinergic urticaria by presenting with wheals of conventional size and by not occurring with fever or a hot bath. Cold urticaria is local at body areas exposed to low ambient temperature or cold objects but can progress to vascular collapse with immersion in cold water (swimming). Solar urticaria is subdivided into six groups by the response to specific portions of the light spectrum. Vibratory angioedema may occur after years of occupational exposure or can be idiopathic; it may be accompanied by cholinergic urticaria. Other rare formsofphysicalallergy,alwaysdefinedbystimulus-specificelicitation, include local heat urticaria, aquagenic urticaria fromcontactwithwater of anytemperature (sometimesassociatedwithpolycythemiavera),and contact urticaria from direct interaction with some chemical substance.
Document 4 (Title: Alternatives to hexachlorophene bathing of newborn infants.): In controlled trials newborn infants were bathed with Lactacyd, pHisoHex, Hibitane, Lanohex or tap water. Bacteriologic samples were taken from three sites (groin, axilla and cord) immediately after birth, following an initial bath with one of the test agents, and on day 3 or 5 after a water bath. Initial bathing with all agents, including water, reduced the concentration of bacteria on the skin to a similar extent. However, comparisons of bacterial flora at birth versus those on days 3 and 5 indicated differences in the actions of the various agents on pathogenic and nonpathogenic organisms. Lactacyd and Hibitane appeared to be suitable alternatives to hexachlorophene in the control of pathogenic bacteria on the skin of newborns. However, their absorption and toxicity in the newborn are unknown and, unless use of a skin disinfectant is warranted, routine bathing of newborns with tap water appears to be satisfactory.
Document 5 (Title: Pediatrics_Nelson): The most common physical urticaria is dermatographism, affecting 2% to 5% of persons. Dermatographism means “writing on the skin” and is easily diagnosed by firmly scratching the skin with a blunt point, such as the wooden tip of a cotton swab or tongue depressor. It is characterized by an urticarial reaction localized to the site of skin trauma. It has been suggested that trauma induces an IgE-mediated reaction causing histamine to be released from the mast cells. Cholinergic urticaria, characterized by the appearance of 1to 3-mm wheals surrounded by large erythematous flares after an increase in core body temperature, occurs commonly in young adults. Lesions may develop during strenuous exercise, after a hot bath, or emotional stress. The lack of airway symptoms differentiates it from exercise-induced anaphylaxis.
