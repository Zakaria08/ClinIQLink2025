Document 1 (Title: Visual acuity): The precise distance at which acuity is measured is not important as long as it is sufficiently far away and the size of the optotype on the retina is the same. That size is specified as a visual angle, which is the angle, at the eye, under which the optotype appears. For 6/6 = 1.0 acuity, the size of a letter on the Snellen chart or Landolt C chart is a visual angle of 5 arc minutes (1 arc min = 1/60 of a degree). By the design of a typical optotype (like a Snellen E or a Landolt C), the critical gap that needs to be resolved is 1/5 this value, i.e., 1 arc min. The latter is the value used in the international definition of visual acuity:
Document 2 (Title: Neurology_Adams): Impairment of visual function, expressed as defects in acuity and alterations of visual fields, obviously stands as the most important symptom of eye disease. A number of terms are commonly used to describe visual loss. Amaurosis is a general term that refers to partial or complete loss of sight. Amblyopia refers to any monocular deficit in vision that occurs in the presence of normal ocular structures. A major cause of amblyopia is the suppression by the brain of vision from one eye during early childhood caused by either strabismus, anisometropia (a significant difference in refractive error), or by media opacities. Nyctalopia is a term for poor twilight or night vision and is associated with extreme myopia, cataracts, vitamin A deficiency, retinitis pigmentosa, and, often, color blindness. There are also a number of positive visual symptoms that are named based on their characteristics, phosphenes, migrainous scintillations, visual illusions, and hallucinations. Irritation,
Document 3 (Title: Snellen Chart -- Definition/Introduction): Tumbling E: Dr. Snellen also developed this chart, which he designed for children and those unable to read or unfamiliar with the Roman alphabet. This chart displays a capital letter E facing in various directions. While observing each character, the patient points in the direction that the E is facing. Landolt C: Comparable to the Tumbling E, this chart displays a C - which some say appears more similar to a broken ring - facing in various directions. The chart was developed by the Swiss ophthalmologist Landolt and is regarded as a laboratory standard by the International Council of Ophthalmology. LEA Symbols Chart : This chart was designed for visual acuity screening in children to eliminate the problems of language barriers. The chart utilizes symbols and creates a play environment to entertain the pediatric patient during the exam. Vivekanand et al. determined that the LEA symbols chart performs better than the Snellen chart for visual acuity assessments in preschool children. [4]
Document 4 (Title: [Amblyopia: reading speed in comparison with visual acuity for gratings, single Landolt Cs and series Landolt Cs].): In the treatment of amblyopia in preschool children, a means of predicting later reading ability would be helpful. This prediction might be possible using a test for visual acuity where the results correlate with reading ability in adult patients with amblyopia. We measured the following four parameters in 18 experienced readers with strabismic amblyopia: (1) time spent reading ten lines of a standard text in one of three magnifications, (2) visual acuity for gratings, (3) visual acuity for single Landolt Cs, and (4) visual acuity for crowded Landolt Cs (one Landolt C flanked by two full rings on each side each at a distance of 2.6 min of arc). The reading text was presented on paper at a distance of 40 cm; the subject had a choice of three magnifications. The acuity tests were generated by a computer on a VDU at 4.6 m. The relative impairment of the amblyopic eye was defined as the quotient between the performance of the amblyopic and the good eye. In addition, the difference between the times spent reading the ten lines with the amblyopic and with the good eye was calculated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Document 5 (Title: [The Teller Acuity Card Test: possibilities and limits of clinical use].): The Teller Acuity Card test was used to examine 49 normal children, 77 with strabismus, 9 with anisometropia and 19 with various organic ocular diseases. The vision of some of these children was also tested with the Landolt C and fixation preference tests. A comparison of the three tests showed that strabismic amblyopia is not reliably detected with the Teller Acuity Cards. On the other hand, this test appears to be a good one for detecting loss of acuity due to ocular diseases.
