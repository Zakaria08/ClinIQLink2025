Document 1 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): 1154 Rickettsial diseases David H. Walker, J. Stephen Dumler, Thomas Marrie The rickettsiae are a heterogeneous group of small, obligately intra-cellular, gram-negative coccobacilli and short bacilli, most of which are transmitted by a tick, mite, flea, or louse vector. Except in the case of louse-borne typhus, humans are incidental hosts. Among 211 Epidemiologic clues to the transmission of a particular pathogen include (1) environmental exposure to ticks, fleas, or mites during the season of activity of the vector species for the disease in the appropriate geographic region (spotted fever and typhus rickettsioses, scrub typhus, ehrlichioses, anaplasmosis); (2) travel to or residence in an endemic geographic region during the incubation period (Table 211-1); (3) expo-sure to parturient ruminants, cats, and dogs (Q fever); (4) exposure to flying squirrels (R. prowazekii infection); and (5) history of previous louse-borne typhus (recrudescent typhus). Clinical laboratory findings, such
Document 2 (Title: Scrub typhus): Signs and symptoms Signs and symptoms include fever, headache, muscle pain, cough, and gastrointestinal symptoms. More virulent strains of O. tsutsugamushi can cause hemorrhaging and intravascular coagulation. Morbilliform rash, eschar, splenomegaly, and lymphadenopathies are typical signs. Leukopenia and abnormal liver function tests are commonly seen in the early phase of the illness. Pneumonitis, encephalitis, and myocarditis occur in the late phase of illness. It has particularly been shown to be the most common cause of acute encephalitis syndrome in Bihar, India. Causes Scrub typhus is transmitted by some species of trombiculid mites ("chiggers", particularly Leptotrombidium deliense), which are found in areas of heavy scrub vegetation. The mites feed on infected rodent hosts and subsequently transmit the parasite to other rodents and humans. The bite of this mite leaves a characteristic black eschar that is useful to the doctor for making the diagnosis.
Document 3 (Title: Weil Felix Test -- Etiology and Epidemiology): The etiologic agents of rickettsial diseases have diverse transmission mechanisms, wide geographic distributions, and a range of disease manifestations. Rickettsiae are most commonly transmitted through fleas, ticks, mites, or mouse vectors, with humans acting as incidental hosts. [4] The Rickettsiaceae that cause life-threatening infections are R. rickettsii (rocky mountain spotted fever), R. prowazekii (louse-borne typhus), Orientia tsutsugamushi (scrub typhus), R. conorii (Mediterranean spotted fever), R. typhi (murine typhus); and, in rare cases, other organisms of the spotted fever group. Most rickettsial species are limited to a particular region due to climatic conditions and natural host constraints; however, some rickettsia species can be encountered globally, such as R. felis and R. typhi . [5] Epidemiologic clues can be used to narrow the possible bacterial etiologies of a suspected rickettsial infection. [6] These clues include:
Document 4 (Title: Chigger mites of the genus Leptotrombidium: key to species and their distribution in China.): Chigger mites of the genus Leptotrombidium (Acari: Trombiculidae) transmit scrub typhus, caused by Rickettsia tsutsugamushi (= R.orientalis) in South-East Asia. In China, eighty-two species of Leptotrombidium have been recorded; these are listed with the names of Provinces where they were found. Five species, L.deliense, L.insularae, L.kaohuense, L.rubellum and L.scutellare, have been implicated as Chinese vectors of scrub typhus. A brief key is given to the larvae of all but three of the Leptotrombidium mites known in China.
Document 5 (Title: Weil Felix Test -- Etiology and Epidemiology): Environmental exposure to ticks, fleas, or mites in regions and seasons where vector-borne diseases are prevalent, such as spotted fever and typhus rickettsioses, scrub typhus, ehrlichioses, and anaplasmosis Travel to or residence in an endemic region Exposure to pregnant ruminants, cats, or dogs, indicating possible Q fever Exposure to flying squirrels, associated with R. prowazekii typhus History of previous louse-borne typhus, which may lead to recrudescent typhus [7]
