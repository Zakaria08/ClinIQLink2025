Document 2 (Title: Adjustment disorder): A stressor is generally an event of a serious, unusual nature that an individual or group of individuals experience. Adjustment disorders can come from a wide range of stressors that can be traumatic or relatively minor, like the loss of a girlfriend/boyfriend, a poor report card, or moving to a new neighborhood. It is thought that the more often the stressor occurs, the more likely it is to produce Adjustment disorder. The objective nature of the stressor is of secondary importance. A stressor gains its pathogenic potential when the patient perceives it as stressful. The identification of a causal stressor is necessary if a diagnosis of adjustment disorder is to be made. There are certain stressors that are more common in different age groups:
Document 3 (Title: REM Rebound Effect -- Treatment / Management): Respiratory, cardiac, gastrointestinal, endocrine, psychiatric, and neurological disorders that affect sleep and potentially cause REM rebound should be diagnosed and treated. Medications or substances that might contribute to REM rebound should be adjusted as necessary to minimize their impact on REM sleep.
Document 4 (Title: Unrecognized association of sleep disorders and depression with chronic pelvic pain.): Assessment of cases of chronic pelvic pain presents a challenging problem, and many physicians overlook the association of sleep disorders and depression with such pain. We examined these linkages in our chronic pelvic pain clinic, using a questionnaire that assists in diagnosis and management of these cases. To date, the cases of 72 patients (both physician- and self-referred) with pelvic pain have been evaluated. Of these patients, 51 of 71 (72%) reported sleep disorders, and 37 of 72 (51%) had clinical depression, as determined by the Beck Depression Inventory. After adjustment for a sleep-related item on the Beck scale, these two measures showed a positive correlation of .355 (P &lt; .01). The scores of pain patients differed significantly from those of a control group of asymptomatic patients on the depression and sleep disorder measures. By being aware and using a simple questionnaire, the clinician may readily identify overlooked factors, such as sleep disorders and depression, when assessing cases of chronic pelvic pain.
Document 5 (Title: Sleep and Neurodegenerative Disorders -- Evaluation -- Insomnia): In patients with Parkinson disease, a detailed evaluation is warranted to identify a potential contributor to insomnia. Patients should be asked about the presence of any motor symptoms at night (cramps, stiffness, or impaired turning in bed), autonomic symptoms such as nocturia, presence of concomitant mood disorder, sleep apnea, or RLS. A history of recent dose adjustments in medications for Parkinson disease should also be obtained. If the patient has difficulty providing a history, sleep logs, diaries, and sleep trackers may be helpful. Self-reported screening tools could be used through validated questionnaires such as the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and sleep problems questionnaire. [49] [50] In patients with Parkinson disease-associated insomnia, Parkinson disease-specific screening questionnaires such as Parkinson Disease Sleep Scale-2 (PDSS-2) or Scales for Outcomes in Parkinson disease-SLEEP can be used. [51] Evaluation tools such as the STOP-Bang score help determine the probability of OSA. [52]
