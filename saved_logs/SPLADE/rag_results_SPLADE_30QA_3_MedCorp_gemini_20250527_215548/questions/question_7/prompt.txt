Document 1 (Title: Nitroimidazole): Nitroimidazole antibiotics From the chemistry perspective, nitroimidazole antibiotics can be classified according to the location of the nitro functional group. Structures with names 4- and 5-nitroimidazole are equivalent from the perspective of drugs since these tautomers readily interconvert. Drugs of the 5-nitro variety include metronidazole, tinidazole, nimorazole, dimetridazole, pretomanid, ornidazole, megazol, and azanidazole. Drugs based on 2-nitromidazoles include benznidazole. Nitroimidazole antibiotics have been used to combat anaerobic bacterial and parasitic infections. Perhaps the most common example is metronidazole. Other heterocycles such as nitrothiazoles (thiazole) are also used for this purpose. Nitroheterocycles may be reductively activated in hypoxic cells, and then undergo redox recycling or decompose to toxic products. References Disulfiram-like drugs
Document 2 (Title: Ofloxacin. A reappraisal of its antimicrobial activity, pharmacology and therapeutic use.): Ofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone whose primary mechanism of action is inhibition of bacterial DNA gyrase. In vitro it has a broad spectrum of activity against aerobic Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, although it is poorly active against anaerobes. Ofloxacin, unlike most other broad spectrum antibacterial drugs, can be administered orally as well as intravenously. Penetration into body tissues and fluids is highly efficient. Clinical trials with orally and intravenously administered ofloxacin have confirmed its potential for use in a wide range of infections, where it has generally proved as effective as standard treatments. Ofloxacin in well tolerated, and in comparison with other available fluoroquinolones is less likely to cause clinically relevant drug interactions. Ofloxacin thus offers a valuable oral treatment (with an option for intravenous administration if necessary) for use in a wide range of clinical infections, but with a particular advantage in more severe or chronic infections when recourse to parenteral broad spectrum agents would normally be required, thereby providing cost savings and additionally allowing outpatient treatment.
Document 3 (Title: Metronidazole -- Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes): There should be judicious prescribing of metronidazole by providers only for known indications and high clinical suspicion for needing treatment of anaerobic bacterial infections, protozoal infections, and microaerophilic bacterial infections. Overprescribing may contribute to increasing future antibiotic resistance to the drug, so a pharmacy consult is necessary for the prescriber to ensure directed therapy. The documentation already exists regarding increased resistance to metronidazole in the treatment of C. difficile infections. Also, prescribers, nurses, and pharmacists should routinely educate patients to abstain from alcoholic beverages while taking metronidazole, which will help lead to fewer disulfiram reaction symptoms; nursing will play a role in this monitoring and for other potential adverse effects. The patient should also be informed by the health care provider of the possible change in urine color while on this medicine. The team of health professionals, including physicians, physician assistants, nurses, and pharmacists, must work together to provide the best care for these patients when using metronidazole in any formulation.
