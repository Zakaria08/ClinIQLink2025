The obstruction may be sudden or insidious, and it may occur at any level of the urinary tract, from the urethra to the renal pelvis. The most common causes are categorized as follows: Congenital, such as atresia of the urethra, valve formations in either the ureter or urethra, an aberrant renal artery compressing the ureter, renal ptosis with torsion, or kinking of the ureter Foreign bodies, such as calculi or sloughed necrotic papillae Proliferative lesions, such as benign prostatic hyperplasia, carcinoma of the prostate, bladder tumors (papilloma and carcinoma), contiguous malignant disease (retroperitoneal lymphoma, and carcinoma of the cervix or uterus) Inflammatory lesions, such as prostatitis, ureteritis, urethritis, and retroperitoneal fibrosis",

        "content": "An adenofibromyomatous proliferation starting from the region of the periurethral glands is referred to as benign prostatic hyperplasia. It is the result of a senile endocrinopathy, which leads to a disbalance of the peripheral hormonal milieu, and of an intraglandular disturbance of the utilization of the hormone. It becomes a disease when it is followed by an increase of the vesical outlet resistance and thus by an obstructive disturbance of the voiding of the urinary bladder. The indication for operation is determined by the degree of the obstruction and its pathophysiological sequelae as well as the complaints of the patients. The conservative therapy is above all symptomatic and indicated only at the initial stage of the disease. The transurethral resection is the operative therapy of choice. In very large hyperplasias the open surgical intervention may be necessary. In inoperable patients a urethral catheter should be renounced for a suprapubic puncture cystostomy. Also after operative ectomy of a benign prostatic hyperplasia the patients may fall ill with a carcinoma of the prostatic gland. Therefore, the duty for undergoing an annual preventive medical examination remains.",
