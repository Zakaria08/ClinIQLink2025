        "content": "Diagnosis The first clinical manifestation of Paget's disease is usually an elevated alkaline phosphatase in the blood. Paget's disease may be diagnosed using one or more of the following tests: Pagetic bone has a characteristic appearance on X-rays. A skeletal survey is therefore indicated. An elevated level of alkaline phosphatase in the blood in combination with normal calcium, phosphate, and aminotransferase levels in an elderly patient are suggestive of Paget's disease. Markers of bone turnover in urine eg. Pyridinoline Elevated levels of serum and urinary hydroxyproline are also found. Bone scans are useful in determining the extent and activity of the condition. If a bone scan suggests Paget's disease, the affected bone(s) should be X-rayed to confirm the diagnosis. Differential diagnosis",

        "content": "Since bone and kidney play central roles in bone mineral homeostasis, conditions that alter bone mineral homeostasis usually affect one or both of these tissues secondarily. Effects on bone can result in osteoporosis (abnormal loss of bone; remaining bone histologically normal), osteomalacia (abnormal bone formation due to inadequate mineralization), or osteitis fibrosa (excessive bone resorption with fibrotic replacement of resorption cavities and marrow). Biochemical markers of skeletal involvement include changes in serum levels of the skeletal isoenzyme of alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, and Nand C-terminal propeptides of type I collagen (reflecting osteoblastic activity), and serum and urine levels of tartrateresistant acid phosphatase and collagen breakdown products (reflecting osteoclastic activity). The kidney becomes involved when the calcium \u00d7 phosphate product in serum rises above the point at which ectopic calcification occurs (nephrocalcinosis) or when the calcium \u00d7",

        "content": "Rapid detection of the exact changes in bone remodelling is exceptionally important. In this paper, the latest bone remodelling biochemical markers are reviewed. Some of them have already been used for a long time, and their utility has been widely demonstrated. The newest ones, in experimental stage, can be used as a complement to the others. The bone remodelling markers reviewed are: 1) Alkaline phosphatase; 2) osteocalcin; 3) other noncollagen of bone matrix such as osteonectin, GLA-protein of the matrix, osteopontine and alpha 2-HS-glycoprotein; 4) Procollagenous and other collagenous peptides of the matrix (C terminal of type I procollagen and urinary elimination of non-dialysis hydroxyproline. Amongst the bone resorption markers studied are: 1) Calcium/creatinine urinary quotient; 2) Tartrate resistant acid phosphatase; 3) Urinary hydroxyproline; 4) Other substance derived from collagen disruption such as hydroxylysine glycoside, piridinolinic intermolecular bridges and the enzymatic activity of proline iminopeptidase. We endeavored to collect all the most important references on the matter, especially those relating to Paget's disease of the bone, primary hyperparathyroidism, tumoral hypercalcemia and postmenopausal osteoporosis.",
