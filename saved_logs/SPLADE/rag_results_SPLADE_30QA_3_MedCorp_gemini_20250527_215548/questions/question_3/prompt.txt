With your own knowledge and the help of the following document:

Document 1 (Title: Gastric surgery for morbid obesity. Complications and long-term weight control.): The efficacy of gastric surgery for morbid obesity has often been questioned because of incomplete long-term patient follow-up. Between 1977 and 1984, 537 consecutive patients received either a gastric bypass with a Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy, an unbanded gastrogastrostomy, or a vertical banded gastroplasty. The follow-up period was 5 years for all patients who underwent Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy and unbanded gastrogastrostomy and 3 years for all patients who underwent vertical banded gastroplasty. Only 5.8% of all patients were unavailable for this late follow-up. The unbanded gastrogastrostomy was not an effective weight-control operation. Both the Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy and vertical banded gastroplasty provided effective long-term weight control. Although the Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy gave slightly better weight control than the vertical banded gastroplasty, the more simple, safe, and physiological vertical banded gastroplasty is the procedure of choice for most patients with morbid obesity.
Document 2 (Title: Surgical Options in the Treatment of Severe Obesity -- Issues of Concern -- Bariatric Procedures for Management of Severe Obesity): The weight loss mechanism typically falls into 1 of 2 categories, but some procedures have both components. These mechanisms include malabsorption and restriction. Neurohormonal effects contribute to the regulation of energy balance and hunger control. Key hormones include leptin and ghrelin. Examples of restrictive procedures include vertical banded gastroplasty, laparoscopic adjustable gastric band, and sleeve gastrectomy. Malabsorptive procedures include jejunoileal bypass, biliopancreatic diversion (BPD), or biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch. A combination procedure commonly performed is the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. [6]
Document 3 (Title: Adjustable gastric band): Unlike more open forms of weight loss surgery (e.g. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery (RNY), Biliopancreatic diversion (BPD) and Duodenal Switch (DS)), gastric banding does not require cutting or removing any part of the digestive system. It is removable, requiring only a laparoscopic procedure to remove the band, after which the stomach usually returns to its normal pre-banded size so it is not unusual for a person to gain weight after having a band removed. However, it is not entirely reversible as adhesions and tissue scarring are inevitable. Unlike those who have procedures such as RNY, DS, or BPD, it is unusual for gastric band patients to experience any nutritional deficiencies or malabsorption of micro-nutrients. Calcium supplements and Vitamin B12 injections are not routinely required following gastric banding (as is often the case with RNY, for example). Gastric dumping syndrome issues also do not occur since intestines are not removed or re-routed.
