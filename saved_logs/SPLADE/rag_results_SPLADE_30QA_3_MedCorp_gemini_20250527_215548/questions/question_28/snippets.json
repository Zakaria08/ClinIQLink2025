        "title": "Colposcopy in women with papillomavirus lesions of the uterine cervix.",
        "content": "Colposcopic examinations for human papillomavirus lesions were performed in 271 women, some of whom had developed concomitant cervical intraepithelial neoplasia since 1981. The colposcopic appearance was classified into one of the following categories: normal, punctate, mosaic, warty, leukoplakial, or combination, and was related to findings in Papanicolaou smears and punch biopsy specimens. There was a good correlation between the colposcopic appearance and the findings in the Papanicolaou smears and punch biopsy specimens, facilitating the diagnosis of the lesions. The accuracy of colposcopy in disclosing the atypias varied according to the growth pattern of the papillomavirus lesions, with the most accurate (100%) in cases of papillomatous condylomas, and the least accurate (50%) in the inverted lesions. White epithelium and combination patterns were most frequently associated with the papillomavirus lesions and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, as evidenced by both cytology and biopsy. During the follow-up, normal colposcopic appearance increased from 32 to 50%, reflecting the established spontaneous regression of a certain percentage of the cervical lesions, or their regression as a result of biopsy. The results are discussed in terms of the mutually complementary roles of colposcopy, cytology, and biopsy, and in view of the clinical behavior of cervical papillomavirus lesions. Colposcopy is mandatory for adequate prospective follow-up of these patients but should not replace cytology and punch biopsy.",

Mosaic Terminal capillaries surrounding roughly circular or polygonal-shaped blocks of acetowhite epithelium crowded together are called mosaic because their appearance is similar to mosaic tile (Fig. 19.11). These vessels form a \u201cbasket\u201d around the blocks of abnormal epithelium. They may arise from a coalescence of many terminal punctate vessels or from the vessels that surround the cervical gland openings (5). Mosaicism tends to be associated with higher-grade lesions and CIN 2 (Fig. 19.12) and CIN 3 (Fig. 19.13). Atypical Vascular Pattern Atypical vascular patterns are characteristic of invasive cervical cancer and include looped vessels, branching vessels, and reticular vessels.",
