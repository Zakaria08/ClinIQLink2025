Document 1 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): 982 Listeria monocytogenes Infections Elizabeth L. Hohmann, Daniel A. Portnoy Listeria monocytogenes is a food-borne pathogen that can cause serious infections, particularly in pregnant women and immunocompromised 176 individuals. A ubiquitous saprophytic environmental bacterium, L. monocytogenes is also a facultative intracellular pathogen with a broad host range. Humans are probably accidental hosts for this microorganism. L. monocytogenes is of interest not only to clinicians but also to basic scientists as a model intracellular pathogen that is used to study basic mechanisms of microbial pathogenesis and host immunity. L. monocytogenes is a facultatively anaerobic, nonsporulating, gram-positive rod that grows over a broad temperature range, including refrigeration temperatures. This organism is motile during growth at low temperatures but much less so at 37°C. The vast majority of cases of human listerial disease can be traced to serotypes 1/2a, 1/2b, and 4.
Document 2 (Title: Western blot analysis of the antibody response in patients with Listeria monocytogenes meningitis and septicemia.): The antibody response in patients with Listeria monocytogenes septicemia and/or meningitis was investigated using Western blot analysis (WBA). Protein antigen preparations were produced from two strains of Listeria monocytogenes, representing serogroup 1 and 4, by sonication and differential centrifugation. IgG antibodies from 8 (50%) of 16 patients with culture verified septicemia and/or meningitis due to Listeria monocytogenes reacted with a 93 kDa antigen from serogroup 1, in contrast to IgG antibodies from only 1 (2%) of 51 controls; these controls represented 21 patients with infections caused by other bacteria and 30 apparently healthy blood donors. Furthermore, IgM antibodies from 3 (19%) of the patients with listeric infections bound to a 106 kDa protein antigen in contrast to none of the controls. In 3 (33%) of 9 patients from whom acute and convalescence serum were available, the patients responded by producing antibodies against new protein antigens. Current methods used in routine serological investigations, i.e. complement fixation and O-agglutination tests, were positive in only 4 (24%) of the 16 patients with listeriosis. The results point to the possibility of designing new immunoassays for detection of septicemia and meningitis caused by Listeria monocytogenes.
Document 3 (Title: Listeria monocytogenes): Listeria monocytogenes is a Gram-positive bacterium, in the division Firmicutes, named after Joseph Lister. Its ability to grow at temperatures as low as 0 °C permits multiplication at typical refrigeration temperatures, greatly increasing its ability to evade control in human foodstuffs. Motile via flagella at 30 °C and below, but usually not at 37 °C, L. monocytogenes can instead move within eukaryotic cells by explosive polymerization of actin filaments (known as comet tails or actin rockets). Studies suggest up to 10% of human gastrointestinal tracts may be colonized by L. monocytogenes. Nevertheless, clinical diseases due to L. monocytogenes are more frequently recognized by veterinarians, especially as meningoencephalitis in ruminants. See: listeriosis in animals.
