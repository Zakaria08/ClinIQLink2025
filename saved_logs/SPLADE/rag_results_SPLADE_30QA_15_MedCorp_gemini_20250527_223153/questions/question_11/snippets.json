Bacteriologic samples were taken from three sites (groin, axilla and cord) immediately after birth, following an initial bath with one of the test agents, and on day 3 or 5 after a water bath. Initial bathing with all agents, including water, reduced the concentration of bacteria on the skin to a similar extent. However, comparisons of bacterial flora at birth versus those on days 3 and 5 indicated differences in the actions of the various agents on pathogenic and nonpathogenic organisms. Lactacyd and Hibitane appeared to be suitable alternatives to hexachlorophene in the control of pathogenic bacteria on the skin of newborns.

The thinking was that water invaded any cracks, wounds, or imperfections in the skin, which were filled with impure fluids. Health was considered to be the natural state of the body, and filling these spaces with pure water, would flush the impurities out, which would rise to the surface of the skin, producing pus. The event of this pus emerging was called a crisis, and was achieved through a multitude of methods. These methods included techniques such as sweating, the plunging bath, the half bath, the head bath, the sitting bath, and the douche bath.

It is characterized by an urticarial reaction localized to the site of skin trauma. It has been suggested that trauma induces an IgE-mediated reaction causing histamine to be released from the mast cells. Cholinergic urticaria, characterized by the appearance of 1to 3-mm wheals surrounded by large erythematous flares after an increase in core body temperature, occurs commonly in young adults. Lesions may develop during strenuous exercise, after a hot bath, or emotional stress. The lack of airway symptoms differentiates it from exercise-induced anaphylaxis.",

        "content": "I present a technique that permits evaluation of the permeability to water of the luminal membrane of the toad urinary bladder, independently of constraints to water flow imposed by the remainder of the tissue. This technique essentially depends on fixation of the luminal membrane with 1% glutaraldehyde for 5 min, and subsequent elimination of cytosolic constraints by decreasing the tonicity of the serosal bath to 1/2 normal strength. The increased hydraulic conductivity found with serosal hypotonicity is readily reversible, as the bladder returns to an isotonic serosal bath. By evaluating water flow in luminally fixed bladders during bathing in normal and hypotonic bath, one may identify the relative contribution of the luminal membrane and the \"cytosol\" on water flow. Using this technique, I found that the effect of the prostaglandin inhibitor Naproxen to increase vasopressin-stimulated water flow is due to increased luminal membrane permeability. The effect of histidine to increase vasopressin-stimulated water flow, however, depends on increased permeability of both the luminal membrane as well as the underlying structures. The action of serosal hypertonicity to induce water flow is due to an increased luminal permeability. However, serosal hypertonicity decreases \"cytosolic\" permeability, so that its overall function is a composite effect of its action at the luminal membrane and the \"cytosolic\" level.",
