With your own knowledge and the help of the following document:

Document 1 (Title: Metronidazole -- Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes): There should be judicious prescribing of metronidazole by providers only for known indications and high clinical suspicion for needing treatment of anaerobic bacterial infections, protozoal infections, and microaerophilic bacterial infections. Overprescribing may contribute to increasing future antibiotic resistance to the drug, so a pharmacy consult is necessary for the prescriber to ensure directed therapy. The documentation already exists regarding increased resistance to metronidazole in the treatment of C. difficile infections. Also, prescribers, nurses, and pharmacists should routinely educate patients to abstain from alcoholic beverages while taking metronidazole, which will help lead to fewer disulfiram reaction symptoms; nursing will play a role in this monitoring and for other potential adverse effects. The patient should also be informed by the health care provider of the possible change in urine color while on this medicine. The team of health professionals, including physicians, physician assistants, nurses, and pharmacists, must work together to provide the best care for these patients when using metronidazole in any formulation. [Level 5]
Document 2 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): Adverse effects include nausea, diarrhea, stomatitis, and peripheral neuropathy with prolonged use. Metronidazole has a disulfiram-like effect, and patients should be instructed to avoid alcohol. Although teratogenic in some animals, metronidazole has not been associated with this effect in humans. Other properties of metronidazole are discussed in Chapter 52. A structurally similar agent, tinidazole, is a once-daily drug approved for treatment of trichomonas infection, giardiasis, amebiasis, and bacterial vaginosis. It also is active against anaerobic bacteria, but is not approved in the USA for treatment of anaerobic infections.
Document 3 (Title: Nitroimidazole): Nitroimidazole antibiotics From the chemistry perspective, nitroimidazole antibiotics can be classified according to the location of the nitro functional group. Structures with names 4- and 5-nitroimidazole are equivalent from the perspective of drugs since these tautomers readily interconvert. Drugs of the 5-nitro variety include metronidazole, tinidazole, nimorazole, dimetridazole, pretomanid, ornidazole, megazol, and azanidazole. Drugs based on 2-nitromidazoles include benznidazole. Nitroimidazole antibiotics have been used to combat anaerobic bacterial and parasitic infections. Perhaps the most common example is metronidazole. Other heterocycles such as nitrothiazoles (thiazole) are also used for this purpose. Nitroheterocycles may be reductively activated in hypoxic cells, and then undergo redox recycling or decompose to toxic products. References Disulfiram-like drugs
Document 4 (Title: Ofloxacin. A reappraisal of its antimicrobial activity, pharmacology and therapeutic use.): Ofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone whose primary mechanism of action is inhibition of bacterial DNA gyrase. In vitro it has a broad spectrum of activity against aerobic Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, although it is poorly active against anaerobes. Ofloxacin, unlike most other broad spectrum antibacterial drugs, can be administered orally as well as intravenously. Penetration into body tissues and fluids is highly efficient. Clinical trials with orally and intravenously administered ofloxacin have confirmed its potential for use in a wide range of infections, where it has generally proved as effective as standard treatments. Ofloxacin in well tolerated, and in comparison with other available fluoroquinolones is less likely to cause clinically relevant drug interactions. Ofloxacin thus offers a valuable oral treatment (with an option for intravenous administration if necessary) for use in a wide range of clinical infections, but with a particular advantage in more severe or chronic infections when recourse to parenteral broad spectrum agents would normally be required, thereby providing cost savings and additionally allowing outpatient treatment.
Document 5 (Title: Gynecology_Novak): Treatment Ideally, treatment of BV should inhibit anaerobes but not vaginal lactobacilli. The following treatments are effective: 1. Metronidazole, an antibiotic with excellent activity against anaerobes but poor activity against lactobacilli, is the drug of choice for the treatment of BV. A dose of 500 mg administered orally twice a day for 7 days should be used. Patients should be advised to avoid using alcohol during treatment with oral metronidazole and for 24 hours thereafter. 2. Metronidazole gel, 0.75%, one applicator (5 g) intravaginally once daily for 5 days, may also be prescribed. The overall cure rates range from 75% to 84% with the aforementioned regimens (16). Clindamycin in the following regimens is effective in treating BV: 1. Clindamycin ovules, 100 mg, intravaginally once at bedtime for 3 days 2. Clindamycin bioadhesive cream, 2%, 100 mg intravaginally in a single dose 3. Clindamycin cream, 2%, one applicator full (5 g) intravaginally at bedtime for 7 days 4.
Document 6 (Title: Acetaldehyde dehydrogenase): The drug disulfiram (Antabuse) prevents the oxidation of acetaldehyde to acetic acid and is used in the treatment of alcoholism. ALDH1 is strongly inhibited by disulfiram, while ALDH2 is resistant to its effect. The cysteine residue at 302 in ALDH1 and 200 in ALDH2 is implicated as a disulfiram binding site on the enzyme and serves as a disfulfiram sensitive thiol site. Covalent binding of disulfiram to the thiol blocks the binding of one of the cysteine residues with iodoacetamide, thereby inactivating the enzyme and significantly lowering catalytic activity. Activity can be recovered by treatment with 2-mercaptoethanol, although not with glutathione. Metronidazole (Flagyl), which is used to treat certain parasitic infections as well as pseudomembranous colitis, causes similar effects to disulfiram. Coprine (which is an amino acid found in certain coprinoid mushrooms) metabolizes in vivo to 1-aminocyclopropanol which causes similar effects as well.
Document 7 (Title: Quinolones -- Indications): Quinolones are a class of broad-spectrum antibiotics with excellent oral bioavailability and can be used to treat a wide variety of bacterial infections. Their clinical utility is restricted, particularly in the outpatient setting, due to their potential for severe side effects. Due to these safety concerns, quinolones are not recommended as first-line agents by the FDA if there are other available antibiotic options with less potential for severe adverse events. There are currently four generations of quinolones. While initial quinolones were effective only against Gram-negative bacteria, succeeding generations gained activity against Pseudomonas sp ., Gram-positive, and atypical bacterial strains. Many different quinolones have undergone development, and among them, the ones currently approved by the FDA for systemic use include moxifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, gemifloxacin, levofloxacin, delafloxacin, and ofloxacin. A few key differences exist in the spectrum of activity between the quinolones. Ciprofloxacin is ineffective against S. pneumoniae . Moxifloxacin lacks sufficient activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa but is effective in treating anaerobes (along with delafloxacin). Delafloxacin is the only quinolone effective against methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). [1]
Document 8 (Title: Toxic leukoencephalopathy): Medication neurotoxicity Besides its role in chemotherapy, methotrexate is also used as an orally administered treatment for rheumatoid arthritis. Leukoencephalopathy can develop from long-term treatment of methotrexate even at low doses. In contrast to intravenous methotrexate for cancer patients, leukoencephalopathy induced by orally taken methotrexate may be associated with cognitive dysfunction and even death. Oxycodone is the main active ingredient in various oral pain relief medications. High doses of opiates such as oxycodone can lead to leukoencephalopathy. The activity of various opioid and nociceptive receptors appear to play a role in the disease; however, the exact mechanism remains unknown. Metronidazole, an antibiotic used to treat aerobic and protozoal infections, has been known at high doses to produce neurologic symptoms associated with toxic leukoencephalopathy.
Document 9 (Title: Treatment of sexually transmitted vaginosis/vaginitis.): Although much has been learned about sexually transmissible forms of vaginitis/vaginosis during the past decade, therapeutic options for these disorders remain limited. A single 2-g oral dose of metronidazole still remains highly effective against most Trichomonas vaginalis infections. Mildly resistant infections can usually be cured with metronidazole oral doses of 2 g daily for 3-7 days. When highly resistant infections occur, toxic levels of metronidazole may be needed for the drug to cure the infection. Metronidazole (500 mg twice daily for 7 days) continues to be highly efficacious in the treatment of bacterial vaginosis. Shorter oral treatment regimens that use single 2-g doses of metronidazole for 2-3 days appear promising but may be associated with higher relapse rates. Oral clindamycin (300 mg twice daily) or local 2% clindamycin cream (once daily for 7 days) also may be effective. Metronidazole intravaginal sponges (250-1,000 mg) used for 3 days may also be effective in the treatment of bacterial vaginosis.
Document 10 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): Metronidazole is well absorbed after oral administration, is widely distributed in tissues, and reaches serum levels of 4–6 mcg/mL after a 250-mg oral dose. It can also be given intravenously. The drug penetrates well into the cerebrospinal fluid and brain, reaching levels similar to those in serum. Metronidazole is metabolized in the liver and may accumulate in hepatic insufficiency. Metronidazole is indicated for treatment of anaerobic or mixed intra-abdominal infections (in combination with other agents with activity against aerobic organisms), vaginitis (trichomonas infection, bacterial vaginosis), Clostridium difficile infection, and brain abscess. The typical dosage is 500 mg three times daily orally or intravenously (30 mg/kg/d). Vaginitis may respond to a single 2-g dose. A vaginal gel is available for topical use.
Document 11 (Title: Guidelines for clinical care: anti-infective agents for intra-abdominal infection. A Surgical Infection Society policy statement.): Several antibiotics have been marketed for therapeutic use in intra-abdominal infection. Often, these agents do not provide a sufficient spectrum activity against both facultative and obligate anaerobic gram-negative organisms, or have certain toxic effects that would not otherwise support their use. Guidelines have been developed for selection of antibiotic therapy for intra-abdominal infections and are presented as a statement of the Surgical Infection Society endorsed by the Executive Council. These guidelines are restricted to infections derived from the gastrointestinal tract and deal with those microorganisms commonly seen in such infections. The recommendations are based on in vitro activity against enteric bacteria, experience in animal models, and documented efficacy in clinical trials. Other concerns regarding pharmacokinetics, mechanisms of action, microbial resistance, and safety were also used in the formation of these guidelines. For community-acquired infections of mild to moderate severity, single-agent therapy with cefoxitin, cefotetan, or cefmetazole or ticarcillin-clavulanic acid is recommended. For more severe infections, single-agent therapy with carbapenems (imipenem/cilastatin) or combination therapy with either a third-generation cephalosporin, a monobactam (aztreonam), or an aminoglycoside plus clindamycin or metronidazole is recommended. Regimens with little or no activity against facultative gram-negative rods or anaerobic gram-negative rods are not considered acceptable.
Document 12 (Title: Ascending cholangitis): Treatment Fluids and antibiotics Cholangitis requires admission to hospital. Intravenous fluids are administered, especially if the blood pressure is low, and antibiotics are commenced. Empirical treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics is usually necessary until it is known for certain which pathogen is causing the infection, and to which antibiotics it is sensitive. Combinations of penicillins and aminoglycosides are widely used, although ciprofloxacin has been shown to be effective in most cases, and may be preferred to aminoglycosides because of fewer side effects. Metronidazole is often added to specifically treat the anaerobic pathogens, especially in those who are very ill or at risk of anaerobic infections. Antibiotics are continued for 7–10 days. Drugs that increase the blood pressure (vasopressors) may also be required to counter the low blood pressure.
Document 13 (Title: Pharmacokinetics and therapeutic efficacy of metronidazole at different dosages.): Metronidazole, a drug effective against certain protozoal and anaerobic infections, was given female patients with Trichomoniasis urogenitalis. Group I received twice daily 250 mg of metronidazole (supplied as 250 mg tablets Vagimid). Group II received in a single dose 1.0 g (4 tablets); and group III, 2.0 g (8 tablets). Serum and urine metronidazole levels were measured polarographically. Kinetic parameters were determined from the measured values of the concentration time curve by a computing program. An exact control of the therapeutic result was carried out. In all patients peak serum levels occurred within 1-3 hr and averaged 5.1 +/- 1.7 microgram/ml after 250 mg doses, 19.6 +/- 3.8 microgram/ml after 1.0 g doses and 40.6 +/- 9.3 microgram/ml after 2.0 g doses. About 35% of the administered dose was recovered in the urine in 12 hr and about 50% in 24 hr. Metronidazole shows protein binding of 10-20% equally in vivo and in vitro. Minimum trichomonacidic concentrations of nearly 1 microgram/ml were still present 12 hr after oral application of 250 mg metronidazole, and 24 hr to 36 hr, respectively after 1.0 g and 2.0 g daily doses. The cure rate was 100%. No serious side effects ocurred in any of the patients.
Document 14 (Title: Foscarnet -- Indications -- Off-Label Uses): Foscarnet also has off-label use in certain instances, such as gastrointestinal diseases including esophagitis or colitis, outer retinal necrosis, allogeneic stem cell transplant, varicella zoster virus (VZV) treatment, and even in the prevention of CMV infection itself. [3] [4] [1] Foscarnet is often administered as monotherapy or in combination with agents such as ganciclovir for CMV and acyclovir for HSV. When ganciclovir alone is ineffective, clinicians will often combine it with foscarnet. If ganciclovir therapy causes strong adverse effects in a patient, foscarnet is administered instead. [5] While foscarnet is often indicated for the above-mentioned viral infections in immunocompromised patients, it has no use in treating HIV because it does not have antiretroviral properties. Preemptive treatment with foscarnet for early human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) reactivation in allogeneic stem cell transplant patients effectively prevents complications, with no cases of encephalitis or pneumonitis. The treatment results in undetectable viral loads and minimal adverse effects, demonstrating a safe, effective strategy. [6] The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) acknowledges the potential use of foscarnet as an option for outpatient parenteral antibiotic therapy (OPAT) in select patients. [7]
Document 15 (Title: Antiparasitic Drugs -- Mechanism of Action -- Antiprotozoal Agents): Metronidazole and tinidazole are 5-nitroimidazole derivatives. Metronidazole has both antibacterial and antiprotozoal properties. It is active against amoebiasis and other protozoal diseases such as trichomoniasis and giardiasis. Within the parasites, it engages in redox reactions, releasing toxic reactive intermediates, making it effective as a luminal and extra-luminal amoebicide. The metronidazole metabolites are taken up by the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), leading to the DNA disruption and, consequently, protein synthesis inhibition. Tinidazole has a similar structure to metronidazole and shares a similar activity profile. However, tinidazole has a higher cure rate for protozoal infections and a better toxicity profile than metronidazole.
