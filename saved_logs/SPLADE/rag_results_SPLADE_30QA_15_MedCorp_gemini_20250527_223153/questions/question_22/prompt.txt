Document 1 (Title: Comparative study of chromatography on thin layers impregnated with organic stationary phases. Chromatographic separation of nitrophenols.): The chromatographic behaviour of nitrophenols on thin layers of silica gel and cellulose was compared, both without impregnation and impregnated with non-aqueous polar stationary phases (formamide, dimethylformamide) and less polar stationary phases (liquid paraffin, octan-1-ol, 1-bromonaphthalene). Cellulose is preferred when using formamide or dimethylformamide if a pure partition process is required. For each particular analyte a certain amount of the stationary phase is always required to suppress the adsorption activity of silica gel. Separation by reversed-phase thin-layer chromatography is strongly affected by the type of stationary phase (the possibility of forming charge-transfer complexes with 1-bromonaphthalene) and its support (the acidic properties of silica gel and its adsorption activity), the mobile phase (content of organic modifier, pH, presence of salts) and the properties of the solutes (polarity, ionizability).
Document 2 (Title: Chromatography -- Introduction -- Column Chromatography): This is the most commonly used type, where a column of fiberglass or steel filled with silica particles acts as a stationary phase. [1] The mobile phase is gas or liquid. In normal-phase column chromatography, a polar stationary phase separates non-polar compounds; in reversed-phase chromatography, the nonpolar stationary phase and the polar mobile phase are used. [7]
Document 3 (Title: Reversed-phase chromatography): Reversed-phase chromatography is a technique using alkyl chains covalently bonded to the stationary phase particles in order to create a hydrophobic stationary phase, which has a stronger affinity for hydrophobic or less polar compounds. The use of a hydrophobic stationary phase is essentially the reverse of normal phase chromatography, since the polarity of the mobile and stationary phases have been inverted – hence the term reversed-phase chromatography. Reversed-phase chromatography employs a polar (aqueous) mobile phase. As a result, hydrophobic molecules in the polar mobile phase tend to adsorb to the hydrophobic stationary phase, and hydrophilic molecules in the mobile phase will pass through the column and are eluted first. Hydrophobic molecules can be eluted from the column by decreasing the polarity of the mobile phase using an organic (non-polar) solvent, which reduces hydrophobic interactions. The more hydrophobic the molecule, the more strongly it will bind to the
Document 4 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Metabolism Metabolism is the chemical transformation of a drug by the body. This modification can occur within several areas; the liver is the organ most commonly involved. Drugs are metabolized by enzymes, but enzyme systems have a finite capacity to metabolize a substrate drug. If a drug is given in a dose at which the concentration does not exceed the rate of metabolism, then the metabolic process is generally linear. If the dose exceeds the amount that can be metabolized, drug accumulation and potential toxicity may occur. Drugs are metabolized through phase I or phase II reactions. In phase I reactions, the drug is made more polar through dealkylation, hydroxylation, oxidation, and deamination. Polarity facilitates drug removal from the body. Phase II reactions, which include glucuronidation, sulfation, and acetylation, result in compounds larger and more polar than the parent drug. Both phases usually inactivate the parent drug, but some drugs are rendered more active. The
Document 5 (Title: Physiology_Levy): Fig. 16.1 illustrates action potentials found in different cardiac cells. Two main types of action potentials occur in the heart and are depicted. One type, the fast response, occurs in normal atrial and ventricular myocytes and in the specialized conducting fibers (Purkinje fibers of the heart) and is divided into five phases. The rapid upstroke of the action potential is designated phase 0. The upstroke is followed by a brief period of partial, early repolarization (phase 1) and then by a plateau (phase 2) that persists for approximately 0.1 to 0.2 second. The membrane then repolarizes (phase 3) until the resting state of polarization (phase 4) is again attained. Final repolarization (phase 3) develops more slowly than depolarization (phase 0). The other type of action potential, the slow response, occurs in the sinoatrial (SA) node, which is the natural pacemaker region of the heart, and in the atrioventricular (AV) node, which is the specialized tissue that conducts the cardiac
Document 6 (Title: Separation of amino acids and peptides on non-polar stationary phases by high-performance liquid chromatography.): Microparticulate non-polar stationary phases, such as octadecyl-silica offer a rapid and efficient means for the separation of peptides and amino acids by high-performance liquid chromatography. Retention is attributed to hydrophobic interaction between the solutes and the hydrocarbonaceous functions covalently bound to the stationary phase surface. Consequently the species are eluted in the order of increasing hydrophobicity. Various peptide mixtures were analyzed by using gradient elution with increasing acetonitrile concentration in the eluent and monitoring the column effluent at 200 or 210 nm with an UV detector. The separation of angiotensins and enzymic digest of polypeptides illustrates the speed of the method which can be used to assay the purity of peptide hormones such as alpha-melanotropin and gramicidin or to analyze the composition of reaction mixtures involving peptides. The efficiency of the method is superior to that obtained on the conventionally used ion-exchanger columns, except for hydrophilic amino acids and peptides that are poorly retarded. Nevertheless, with a suitable ionic surfactant in the mobile phase, non-polar stationary phases can be used for the separation of these species as well.
Document 7 (Title: Chromatography -- Introduction -- Stationary Phase): The stationary phase is a crucial component of chromatography that interacts with analytes as they pass through, leading to separation. Solid, liquid, or gas can be held over a supporting medium. The stationary phase interacts with various mixture components based on the polarity, affinity, size, and charge. Thus, different analytes have varying degrees of interaction with the stationary phase, leading to differential retention times and elution profiles. [1] Different types of chromatography use combinations of stationary and mobile phases to achieve separation. Refer to image 1 for the classification of chromatography.
Document 8 (Title: High-performance liquid chromatography): Reversed-phase chromatography (RPC) Reversed phase HPLC (RP-HPLC) has a non-polar stationary phase and an aqueous, moderately polar mobile phase. One common stationary phase is a silica which has been surface-modified with RMe2SiCl, where R is a straight chain alkyl group such as C18H37 or C8H17. With such stationary phases, retention time is longer for molecules which are less polar, while polar molecules elute more readily (early in the analysis). An investigator can increase retention times by adding more water to the mobile phase; thereby making the affinity of the hydrophobic analyte for the hydrophobic stationary phase stronger relative to the now more hydrophilic mobile phase. Similarly, an investigator can decrease retention time by adding more organic solvent to the eluent. RP-HPLC is so commonly used that it is often incorrectly referred to as "HPLC" without further specification. The pharmaceutical industry regularly employs RP-HPLC to qualify drugs before their release.
Document 9 (Title: [High-performance liquid-liquid chromatography in beverage analysis].): Liquid liquid chromatography was performed with columns packed with stationary phases chemically bonded to silica microparticules. These columns show a high efficiency and are used very easily. Flavouring compounds like aromatic aldehydes which have a low volatility were analyzed in brandy using a polar phase alkylnitrile. Sapid substances like amarogentin in Gentiana lutea or glyryrrhizin in Glycyrrhiza glabra were determined by reversed phase chromatography. Finally ionizable substances like synthetic dyes can be analyzed by paired ion chromatography witha non polar stationary phase.
Document 10 (Title: Chromatography -- Introduction -- Planar Chromatography): The stationary phase is spread as a thin layer on a flat surface. The sample is added as a small spot or a band over it, and the entire plane is kept in a slanting position over a liquid mobile phase. The mobile phase moves over the stationary phase due to capillary action carrying the sample, resulting in separation. When a sheet of paper is used, it is called paper chromatography. If a thin layer of absorbent material like silica, aluminum, or cellulose coated over a glass plate is used, it is called thin-layer chromatography. [5] After separation, the colorless compounds are identified using fluorescence, radioactivity, or by producing visible color. The position of each molecule is identified, and the distance traveled is measured. The retention factor or Rf value for each of the molecules is expressed, and the identification of the molecules is compared with the standard Rf. The Rf value is calculated by dividing the distance a solute travels by the distance the solvent travels. A number between 0 and 1 represents the Rf value and is affected by several factors, including the type of stationary phase, the polarity of the solvent, the temperature, and the solvent concentration. [6] Refer to image 2 (planar chromatography).
Document 11 (Title: Reversed-phase chromatography): Stationary phases In the 1970s, most liquid chromatography was performed using a solid support stationary phase (also called a column) containing unmodified silica or alumina resins. This type of technique is now referred to as normal-phase chromatography. Since the stationary phase is hydrophilic in this technique, molecules with hydrophilic properties contained within the mobile phase will have a high affinity for the stationary phase, and therefore will adsorb to the column packing. Hydrophobic molecules experience less of an affinity for the column packing, and will pass through to be eluted and detected first. Elution of the hydrophilic molecules adsorbed to the column packing requires the use of more hydrophilic or more polar solvents in the mobile phase to shift the distribution of the particles in the stationary phase towards that of the mobile phase.
Document 12 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): Phase I reactions usually convert the parent drug to a more polar metabolite by introducing or unmasking a functional group (–OH, –NH2, –SH). Often these metabolites are inactive, although in some instances activity is only modified or even enhanced. If phase I metabolites are sufficiently polar, they may be readily excreted. However, many phase I products are not eliminated rapidly and undergo a subsequent reaction in which an endogenous substrate such as glucuronic acid, sulfuric acid, acetic acid, or an amino acid combines with the newly incorporated functional group to form a highly polar conjugate. Such conjugation or synthetic reactions are the hallmarks of phase II metabolism. A great variety of drugs undergo these sequential biotransformation reactions, although in some instances, the parent drug may already possess a functional group that may form a conjugate directly. For example, the hydrazide moiety of isoniazid is known to form an
Document 13 (Title: Neurology_Adams): Spikes are transient high-voltage waveforms that have a pointed peak at recording speeds and duration of 20 to 70 ms; a sharp waves is a similarly configured transient with a duration of 70 to 200 ms (Fig. 2-7F). Spikes or sharp waves that occur interictally are referred to as epileptiform discharges. At times, it is possible to infer localization from the reversal of the polarity of a sharp transient or spike in the EEG record. This “phase reversal” between two channels implies that the electrical activity originates near the site of the position of the common electrode (Fig. 2-7G, H).
Document 14 (Title: Mass Spectrometer -- Specimen Requirements and Procedure -- Liquid Chromatography): Liquid chromatography separates samples based on interactions with the mobile and stationary phases, often depending on polarity. If a component's polarity differs from that of the mobile phase, it migrates more quickly through the chromatography column. The sample is separated into bands of individual components that can be further analyzed in mass spectrometry. [18] Other techniques used for sample preparation include electrospray ionization, which uses high voltages to separate components, and fast atom bombardment, which uses a beam to generate ions from a solid phase. [19] [20] The types of samples that can be analyzed within mass spectrometry include proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, and fatty acids. [21]
Document 15 (Title: Aqueous normal-phase chromatography): Aqueous normal-phase chromatography (ANP) is a chromatographic technique that involves the mobile phase region between reversed-phase chromatography (RP) and organic normal-phase chromatography (ONP). Principle In normal-phase chromatography, the stationary phase is polar and the mobile phase is nonpolar. In reversed phase we have just the opposite; the stationary phase is nonpolar and the mobile phase is polar. Typical stationary phases for normal-phase chromatography are silica or organic moieties with cyano and amino functional groups. For reversed phase, alkyl hydrocarbons are the preferred stationary phase; octadecyl (C18) is the most common stationary phase, but octyl (C8) and butyl (C4) are also used in some applications. The designations for the reversed phase materials refer to the length of the hydrocarbon chain.
