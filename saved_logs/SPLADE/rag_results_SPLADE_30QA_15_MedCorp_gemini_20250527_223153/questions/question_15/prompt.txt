Document 1 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Missense and nonsense mutations in the apoA-I gene are present in some patients with low plasma levels of HDL-C (usually 15–30 mg/ dL), but are a rare cause of low plasma HDL-C levels. Most individuals with low plasma HDL-C levels due to missense mutations in apoA-I do not appear to have premature CHD. Patients who are heterozygous for an Arg173Cys substitution in apoA-I (so-called apoA-IMilano) have very low plasma levels of HDL-C due to impaired LCAT activation and accelerated clearance of the HDL particles containing the abnormal apoA-I. Despite having very low plasma levels of HDL-C, these individuals do not have an increased risk of premature CHD. A few selected missense mutations in apoA-I and apoA-II promote the formation of amyloid fibrils, which can cause systemic amyloidosis.
Document 2 (Title: Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia -- Complications): Patients with CAH are at an increased risk of cardiometabolic diseases, including hypertension, obesity, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, impaired glucose homeostasis, increased carotid intima-media thickness, and cardiovascular events. However, most data available are based on surrogate markers rather than definitive outcomes. [51] [52] Practitioners should remain cautious, promote a healthy lifestyle, and continue analyzing longer-term data to assess hard outcomes.
Document 3 (Title: Hepatic lipase): Secretion of HDL from the liver into the circulatory system regulates the release of HL into the body's bloodstream. This is because factors that increase the release of HDL (such as fasting, leading to low levels of HDL) increases the amount of HL bound to HDL and released into the bloodstream. Another lipoprotein, ApoA-I, which increases release of HDL was shown to have a similar effect by mutating the gene that coded it. Mutated ApoA-I protein caused a decrease in HL release and thus decreased the amount of HL bound to HDL and released into the bloodstream. Clinical significance Hepatic lipase deficiency is a rare, autosomal recessive disorder that results in elevated high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol due to a mutation in the hepatic lipase gene. Clinical features are not well understood and there are no characteristic xanthomas. There is an association with a delay in atherosclerosis in an animal model.
Document 4 (Title: Determinants of carotid intima-media thickness: a population-based ultrasonography study in eastern Finnish men.): We investigated the determinants of maximal intima-media thickness of common carotid arteries in a population-based sample of 1224 Eastern Finnish men aged 42, 48, 54 or 60 years. A high-resolution B-mode ultrasonographic examination was performed as part of the Kuopio Ischaemic Heart Disease Risk Factor Study (KIHD). The maximal intima-media thickness (IMT) varied between 0.48 mm and 4.09 mm (mean value +/- SD, 0.94 mm +/- 0.38 mm). Age (standardized partial coefficient, beta = 0.238, P less than 0.0001), ambulatory pulse pressure (beta = 0.130, P less than 0.0001), cigarette-years of smoking (beta = 0.125, P less than 0.0001), serum LDL cholesterol concentration (beta = 0.125, P less than 0.0001), history of ischaemic heart disease (beta = 0.125, P less than 0.0001), pre-exercise systolic blood pressure (beta = 0.070, P = 0.0113) and diabetes (beta = 0.068, P = 0.0072) were most strongly associated with IMT. This study confirms the role of systolic blood pressure, smoking and serum LDL cholesterol levels as major risk factors for increased carotid intima-media thickness.
Document 5 (Title: Intima-media thickness): Carotid IMT has been used in many epidemiological and clinical studies and these have shown associations with several risk factors, including type 2 diabetes, familial hypercholesterolemia, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), triglycerides, rheumatoid arthritis, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and air pollution. Since the 1990s, some clinical trials of lifestyle and pharmaceutical interventions have also used carotid artery IMT as a surrogate endpoint for evaluating the regression and/or progression of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; however the appropriateness of carotid IMT in this context is uncertain. Although carotid intima-media thickness is strongly associated with atherosclerosis, thickening of the intima-media may not always be due to atherosclerosis. Intima-medial thickening is a complex process, depending on a variety of factors, including blood pressure, local hemodynamics, shear stress and circumferential tensile stress. Variations in IMT between
Document 6 (Title: Familial Combined Hyperlipidemia -- Evaluation): Several studies have reported an association between FCH and increased carotid intima-media thickness (IMT), a marker of subclinical atherosclerosis. Therefore, a carotid ultrasound may be performed to assess the presence of subclinical atherosclerosis in patients with FCH. [24] [25]
Document 7 (Title: Arterial wall thickness in familial hypercholesterolemia. Ultrasound measurement of intima-media thickness in the common carotid artery.): B-mode ultrasound was used to noninvasively determine wall thickness and lumen diameter in the common carotid artery in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (n = 53) and in a control group (n = 53). The controls were matched for sex, age, height, and weight, and all had a serum cholesterol level below 6.5 mmol/l. The study was performed to evaluate whether the patients had a thicker arterial wall compared with that of the control group. Wall thickness was determined as the combined intima-media thickness of the far wall and is presented as the mean and maximum thickness of a 10-mm-long section of the common carotid artery. The difference between the groups was 0.13 mm in mean wall thickness (p less than 0.001; 95% confidence interval, 0.07-0.18 mm) and 0.20 mm in maximum wall thickness (p less than 0.001; 95% confidence interval, 0.09-0.23 mm). Fifty of the subjects were examined twice to estimate the interobserver variability. The coefficients of variation for mean and maximum wall thickness were 10.2% and 8.9%, respectively. The two study groups were well matched and differed only in lipid levels. Thus, there is reason to believe that the difference in wall thickness can be explained by the background of familial hypercholesterolemia and the increased cholesterol levels.
Document 8 (Title: High density lipoprotein deficiency syndrome in chickens is not associated with an increased susceptibility to atherosclerosis.): A spontaneous high density lipoprotein (HDL) deficiency syndrome in chickens associated with a Z-linked (sex-linked) mutation has been reported (F. Poernama et al, J Lipid Res 1990;31:955-963). The mutant, called WHAM (Wisconsin hypo-alpha mutant), has a 70-90% reduction in plasma HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I (apo A-I) concentrations. In the present study, the effect of the HDL deficiency on diet-induced or spontaneous atherosclerosis was assessed. Control chickens maintained on a high-cholesterol diet for 28 weeks experienced a 2.4-fold rise in the plasma very low density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration, while the same diet induced a 3.7-fold rise in the low density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration in WHAM chickens. The high-cholesterol diet did not elevate the plasma HDL cholesterol or apo A-I concentrations in either group. Both the aortic area of involvement and the width of lesions were quantified by gross and microscopic examination, respectively. Cholesterol feeding produced a significant increase in the area of the aorta with atherosclerotic lesions in both control and mutant chickens. The HDL deficiency in WHAM chickens did not correlate with a higher lesion area or increased lesion thickness. To assess the effect of HDL deficiency on spontaneous atherosclerosis, a separate group of control and WHAM chickens was maintained on a low-fat, cholesterol-free diet for 3 years. At the end of the 3-year period, the area and thickness of the spontaneous aortic lesions in control and WHAM chickens were not significantly different. Spontaneous HDL deficiency in chickens is therefore not associated with increased susceptibility to atherosclerosis.
Document 9 (Title: Ultrasound measurement of wall thickness in the carotid artery: fundamental principles and description of a computerized analysing system.): A B-mode [two-dimensional (2D)] image from the carotid artery may be described as containing seven echo zones. The aim of the present work is to discuss how lumen diameter and wall thickness can be measured from these zones, and to review some of the basic principles of ultrasound physics and imaging. Simple experiments were performed to identify the echoes defining intima-lumen interfaces. The results showed that: (1) The intima-media thickness of the near wall cannot be measured in a valid way. (2) The lumen diameter of a blood vessel is defined by the distance from the leading edge of the intima-lumen interface of the near wall (echo zone 3) to the leading edge of the lumen-intima interface of the fall wall (echo zone 5). (3) Previously published studies have validated the intima-media complex of the far wall as the distance from the leading edge of the lumen-intima interface of the far wall to the leading edge of the media-adventitia interface of the far wall (echo zone 7). We suggest that if measurements on the near wall are performed, measurements from the far wall should also be presented separately, and if lumen diameter is measured, that this measurement is carried out according to the leading edge principle. We describe a computerized analysing system for the measurement of wall thickness and plaque area on the carotid and femoral arteries. The system is based on a low-cost PC and a frame grabber board and calculates minimum, maximum and mean values of lumen diameter and wall thickness from a section of the artery.
Document 10 (Title: Low HDL Cholesterol -- Pathophysiology): Several mutations were found in a population study to determine the frequency of familial hypoalphalipoproteinemia. In the children with the identified mutations, apo A-I levels were reduced by roughly 50% in the heterozygotes, and homozygotes were deficient in plasma HDL and apo A-I. The deleterious mutation is believed to be autosomal dominant. ATP binding cassette transporter (ABC1) mutations were detected in both familial HDL deficiency, and Tangier disease resulting in impaired cholesterol efflux from macrophages via the cholesterol efflux regulatory protein. [7] [8] This impairment in cholesterol efflux leads to foam cells, which may explain the increased risk of coronary artery disease in these two conditions. [7] [8]
Document 11 (Title: Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator): Having a homozygous pair of genes with the ΔF508 mutation prevents the CFTR protein from assuming its normal position in the cell membrane. This causes increased water retention in cells, corresponding dehydration of the extracellular space, and an associated cascade of effects on various parts of the body. These effects include: thicker mucous membranes in the epithelia of afflicted organs; obstruction of narrow respiratory airways as a result of thicker mucous and inhibition of the free movement of mucocilia; congenital absence of the vas deferens due to increased mucus thickness during fetal development; pancreatic insufficiency due to blockage of the pancreatic duct with mucus; and increased risk of respiratory infection due to build-up of thick, nutrient-rich mucus where bacteria thrive. These are the symptoms of cystic fibrosis, a genetic disorder; however, ΔF508 is not the only mutation that causes this disorder.
Document 12 (Title: Biochemistry_Lippinco): Answer = A. The clinical manifestations of cystic fibrosis (CF) are the consequence of chloride retention with increased water absorption that causes mucus on an epithelial surface to be excessively thick and sticky. The result is pulmonary and gastrointestinal problems such as respiratory infection and impaired exocrine and endocrine pancreatic functions (pancreatic insufficiency). Impaired endocrine pancreatic function can result in diabetes with associated hyperglycemia. The genetic testing technique described, and one used in the diagnosis of CF, is the use of allele-specific oligonucleotides (ASO). Some mutations do result in increased degradation of the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein, but degradation is initiated by tagging the protein with ubiquitin. Frameshift mutations alter the reading frame through the addition or deletion of nucleotides by a number not divisible by three. Because the ∆F509 mutation is caused by the loss of three nucleotides that code
Document 13 (Title: Interactions of serum copper, selenium, and low density lipoprotein cholesterol in atherogenesis.): To investigate the interactions between serum copper, selenium, and low density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations with regard to the progression of carotid atherosclerosis. Longitudinal study of a cohort of middle aged men followed up for 24 months. Epidemiological survey of the population of seven communities in eastern Finland. 126 men aged 42, 48, 54, or 60 at examination randomly selected from a population based sample of 2682 men. Increase in maximal carotid intima media thickness. The mean increase in the maximal common carotid intima media thickness after two years was greater in men with high serum copper concentrations (0.16 mm compared with 0.08 mm in men with concentrations less than 17.6 mumol/l; p = 0.010), those with low serum selenium concentrations (0.15 mm compared with 0.09 mm in men with concentrations greater than or equal to 1.40 mumol/l; p = 0.035), and those with raised serum low density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations (0.15 mm compared with 0.08 mm in men with concentrations less than 4.0 mmol/l; p = 0.032) after adjustment for age and cigarette pack years in a three way analysis of covariance. A raised serum low density lipoprotein concentration was associated with accelerated progression of atherosclerosis only in men with higher than median serum copper concentrations (net difference 0.22 mm; p less than 0.001 for two way interaction), and this synergism was even more pronounced in men with serum selenium concentrations below the median value (net difference 0.41 mm; p = 0.042 for three way interaction). These data provide evidence of a synergistic effect of copper (a pro-oxidant), a low serum concentration of selenium (a cofactor of an enzyme that scavenges free radicals), and low density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration in atherogenesis.
Document 14 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): GENETIC ASSOCIATIONS WITH SPECIFIC AIDS AND NON-AIDS CONDITIONS • carotid artery disease Many of the non-AIDS events in HIV-infected individuals resemble those related to immune senescence and those found in the HIV-uninfected aging population. A functional SNP in the ryanodine receptor 3 (RYR3) gene was found to be associated with an increased risk of common carotid intima–media thickness (cIMT), which is a surrogate for subclinical atherosclerosis. Functional studies on RYR3 and its isoforms demonstrate a major role of these receptors in modulating endothelial function and atherogenesis via calcium signaling pathways, providing a biologically plausible mechanism by which the SNP in RYR3 may associate with increased cIMT risk.
Document 15 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Disorders of Lipoprotein Metabolism 2446 disease. This syndrome is often referred to as isolated low HDL. A family history of low HDL-C facilitates the diagnosis of an inherited condition, which may follow an autosomal dominant pattern. The metabolic etiology of this disease appears to be primarily accelerated catabolism of HDL and its apolipoproteins. Some of these patients may have ABCA1 mutations and therefore technically have heterozygous Tangier disease. Several kindreds with primary hypoalphalipoproteinemia and an increased incidence of premature CHD have been described, although it is not clear if the low HDL-C level is the cause of the accelerated atherosclerosis in these families. Association of hypoalphalipoproteinemia with premature CHD may depend on the specific nature of the gene defect or the underlying metabolic defect that either directly or indirectly causes the low plasma HDL-C level.
