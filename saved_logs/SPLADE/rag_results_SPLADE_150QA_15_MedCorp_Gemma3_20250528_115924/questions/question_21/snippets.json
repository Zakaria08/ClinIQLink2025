These symptoms were progressively getting worse, and he was admitted to our department on June 12, 1990. General physical examination was unremarkable. Neurologically cranial nerves were intact except old right, traumatic strabismus. Muscle tone and deep tendon reflexes were normal throughout, but bilateral Babinski and Chaddock reflexes were present. Mild weakness of lower extremities were found on muscle testing (4/5). In sensory system, superficial sensory disturbance below T10 was seen, and markedly diminished vibration and position senses of lower extremities were noted. Cerebellar test was intact, although unsteadiness was found on heel-shin test. Romberg sign was definitely positive. His gait was wide-based and ataxic. Laboratory data showed no abnormalities in CBC, chemistry, urinalysis, serological tests and endocrinological examinations. Spinal MRI (Siemens 1.5 Tesla) showed abnormal deposition of epidural fatty tissues compressing spinal cord with flattening of cord from T4 to T8. Spinal ataxia as compressive myelopathy due to epidural lipomatosis was considered and he underwent laminectomy from T4 to T8 with improvement in walking. Epidural lipomatosis is an unusual cause of spinal cord compression, presenting compressive myelopathy, radiculopathy, cauda equina syndrome, intermittent claudication, or back pain. Most of cases were associated with long-term administration of adrenocortical steroid hormone, or underlying diseases, except only 3 cases including ours. This is the first case of spinal epidural lipomatosis presenting progressive gait disturbance due to spinal ataxia.",

        "content": "Cauda equina and conus medullaris syndromes have overlap in anatomy and clinical presentation. Therefore, for the purpose of\u00a0this discussion, they will be grouped, and notable differences highlighted. The conus medullaris is the terminal end of the spinal cord, which typically occurs at the L1 vertebral level in the average adult. [1] Conus medullaris syndrome (CMS) results when there is compressive damage to the spinal cord from T12-L2. [1] The cauda equina is a group of nerves and nerve roots stemming from the distal end of the spinal cord, typically levels L1-L5 and contains axons of nerves that give both motor and sensory innervation to the legs, bladder, anus, and perineum. [2] Cauda equina syndrome (CES) results from compression and disruption of the function of these nerves and can be inclusive of the conus medullaris or distal to it, and most often occurs when damage occurs to the L3-L5 nerve roots. [1] Both syndromes are neurosurgical emergencies as they can present with back pain radiating to the legs, motor and sensory dysfunction of the lower extremities, bladder and/or bowel dysfunction, sexual dysfunction and saddle anesthesia. [3] CMS and CES also carry a high risk of litigation as delays in diagnosis and management can lead to devastating life-long impairment.",
