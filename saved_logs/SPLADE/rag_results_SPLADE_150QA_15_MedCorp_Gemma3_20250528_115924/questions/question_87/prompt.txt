Document 1 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): radiographic imaging with CT scan, positron emission tomography (PET), or preferably CT-PET. PET scanning attempts to identify sites of malignancy based on glucose metabolism by measuring the uptake of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). Rapidly dividing cells, presumably in the lung tumors, will preferentially take up 18F-FDG and appear as a “hot spot.” To date, PET has been mostly used for staging and detection of metastases in lung cancer and in the detection of nodules >15 mm in diameter. Combined 18F-FDG PET-CT imaging has been shown to improve the accuracy of staging in NSCLC compared to visual correlation of PET and CT or either study alone. CT-PET has been found to be superior in identifying pathologically enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes and extrathoracic metastases. A standardized uptake value (SUV) of >2.5 on PET is highly suspicious for malignancy. False negatives can be seen in diabetes, in lesions <8 mm, and in slow-growing tumors (e.g., carcinoid tumors or well-differentiated
Document 2 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): fistulas in ano. The use of an endorectal coil may increase sensitivity.Positron Emission Tomography. Positron emission tomog-raphy (PET) is used for imaging tissues with high levels of anaerobic glycolysis, such as malignant tumors. 13F-fluorode-oxyglucose (FDG) is injected as a tracer; metabolism of this molecule then results in positron emission. PET has been used as an adjunct to CT in the staging of colorectal cancer and may prove useful in discriminating recurrent cancer from fibrosis. By combining PET and CT technology (PET/CT), anatomic correlation between regions of high isotope accumulation (“hot spots”) on PET and abnormalities on CT can be determined. PET/CT increasingly is used to diagnose recurrent and/or meta-static colorectal cancer. However, the efficacy and utility of this technology remains unproven.Scintigraphy to Assess Gastrointestinal Bleeding.

Document 3 (Title: Uptake of 2-deoxy, 2-(18F) fluoro-D-glucose in bladder cancer: animal localization and initial patient positron emission tomography.): An orthotopically transplanted, locally metastasizing rat bladder tumor model was developed to evaluate the extent of uptake of fluoro-deoxy-glucose (FDG) in bladder cancer. Significant uptake of FDG in localized bladder tumors in rats was shown, with an average tumor-to-blood ratio of 39 at 2 hours after intravenous FDG administration. Metastases (3 nodal and 1 peritoneal) also showed significant uptake of FDG, with an average metastasis-to-blood ratio of 21.7, and tumor involved-to-normal lymph node ratio of 5.3. Because FDG is excreted in the urine, urinary FDG potentially could prevent the use of FDG/positron emission tomography (FDG/PET) scanning for localized bladder cancer. Bladder lavage successfully reduced the retention of FDG in the normal rat bladder, with an estimated uptake ratio of tumor-to-normal bladder of 13.1 after 5 ml. saline irrigation. Based on these data, we performed an FDG/PET scan of a patient with biopsy proved recurrent intravesical bladder cancer after radiation therapy. Computerized tomography (CT) of the pelvis showed abnormalities consistent with radiation scarring and extravesical tumor. Due to the scarring, the extent of tumor growth could not be determined. The patient also had pulmonary opacities seen on chest radiography. The FDG/PET scan of this patient showed significant extravesical uptake in the pelvis, confirming the abnormality noted on CT. Good images of the clinically apparent metastases in the chest also were obtained. These preliminary data indicate that FDG/PET imaging of bladder cancer is feasible and it may provide new information for the diagnosis and staging of patients with bladder cancer.
Document 4 (Title: Recurrent rectal cancer and scar: differentiation with PET and MR imaging.): The value of positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in differentiating recurrent rectal cancer and scar was investigated. PET with fluorine-18 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) and MR imaging were performed in 15 patients with suspected recurrence. FDG accumulation in the mass was measured by means of the differential absorption ratio (DAR). All 11 patients with confirmed recurrent rectal cancer had increased accumulation of FDG in the mass (DAR = 4.73 +/- 2.28). Low FDG accumulation in the mass (DAR = 0.97 +/- 0.15) was noted in the remaining four patients, in whom the presence of a scar was proved by means of follow-up observation with or without biopsy. On the MR images, the recurrent tumor could be differentiated from scar in all but one case. The lesion-muscle signal intensity ratios on the T2-weighted images for the recurrent tumor and scar were 2.18 +/- 0.55 and 0.89 +/- 0.30, respectively. PET and MR imaging complement each other in the differential diagnosis between recurrent rectal cancer and scar. PET may also permit the evaluation of the effect of therapy.
Document 5 (Title: Fludeoxyglucose (18F) -- Administration -- Special Population): COVID-19 Vaccination: Transient FDG uptake in axillary, supraclavicular, and cervical lymph nodes is noted after ipsilateral deltoid vaccination, which may confound interpretation in patients with cancer FDG PET/CT. [23] Therefore, the COVID-19 Task Force Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (SNMMI) recommends that it is essential to acknowledge that FDG-avid lymphadenopathy can occur in the axillary, lower cervical, and supraclavicular lymph nodes ipsilateral to the vaccination site. FDG-avid lymphadenopathy can be seen for 4 to 6 weeks or longer after the most recent dose of the vaccination. Consequently, questionnaires should be revised to include details about the dates and sites of vaccination and which vaccine was administered. If possible, the COVID-19 vaccination should be administered in the contralateral arm for patients with a history of breast, head, and neck cancers. These recommendations may help oncologists decide the appropriate workup and suggest that breast cancer patients be vaccinated on their healthy side to avoid unnecessary biopsies. In approximately half the patients receiving the novel mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine, PET/CT demonstrated avid ipsilateral lymphadenopathy, significantly less common in immunocompromised and elderly patients. These results suggest that 18F-FDG PET/CT may give a clue regarding the patient's immune response to the vaccination. [24]
Document 6 (Title: Fluorodeoxyglucose (18F)): Applications In PET imaging, 18F-FDG is primarily used for imaging tumors in oncology, where a static 18F-FDG PET scan is performed and the tumor 18F-FDG uptake is analyzed in terms of Standardized Uptake Value (SUV). FDG PET/CT can be used for the assessment of glucose metabolism in the heart and the brain. 18F-FDG is taken up by cells, phosphorylated by hexokinase (whose mitochondrial form is greatly elevated in rapidly growing malignant tumours), and retained by tissues with high metabolic activity, such as most types of malignant tumours. As a result, FDG-PET can be used for diagnosis, staging, and monitoring treatment of cancers, particularly in Hodgkin's disease, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, colorectal cancer, breast cancer, melanoma, and lung cancer. It has also been approved for use in diagnosing Alzheimer's disease.
Document 7 (Title: Fluorodeoxyglucose (18F)): Since its development in 1976, 18F-FDG had a profound influence on research in the neurosciences. The subsequent discovery in 1980 that 18F-FDG accumulates in tumors underpins the evolution of PET as a major clinical tool in cancer diagnosis. 18F-FDG is now the standard radiotracer used for PET neuroimaging and cancer patient management. The images can be assessed by a nuclear medicine physician or radiologist to provide diagnoses of various medical conditions.
Document 8 (Title: PET Scanning -- Indications -- Oncology): FDG-PET has a role in the detection of recurrent cervical cancer in symptomatic and asymptomatic women. Thiry percent of asymptomatic women had recurrent disease detected by PET scan compared to 66.7% of symptomatic women. The sensitivity of PET for recurrent disease in asymptomatic women was 80.0%, with a specificity of 100%, a positive predictive value of 100%, and a negative predictive value of 88.9%. For symptomatic women, the sensitivity of PET was 100%, specificity 85.7%, the positive predictive value was 93.3%, and the negative predictive value was 100%. Hence, whole-body PET can be a sensitive imaging modality for the detection of recurrent cervical carcinoma in both symptomatic and asymptomatic women. [11]
Document 9 (Title: PET Scanning -- Indications -- Oncology): A positive FDG-PET scan means a tissue biopsy is indicated in that location. [8] In FDG-PET evaluation of cancers of the esophagus and gastroesophageal junction, FDG-PET had lower accuracy in the diagnosis of locoregional nodes (N1–2) than combined CT (computed tomography) and EUS (endoscopic ultrasound) (48% vs. 69%) because of a lack of sensitivity (22% vs. 83%). The accuracy for distant nodal metastasis was significantly higher for FDG-PET than the combined use of CT & EUS. Sensitivity was no different; however, specificity was higher. FDG-PET correctly upstaged 5 patients (12%) from the N1–2 stage to the M+Ly stage, while 1 was falsely downstaged by FDG-PET scanning. [9] In a study on the role of FDG PET scan in colorectal cancer screening in asymptomatic adults, it was found that the sensitivity of FDG-PET to detect primary colorectal cancer is high, with primary colorectal cancer being detected with FDG PET in a resectable stage. FDG-PET could detect large size (> 0.7 cm) and pre-malignant change of colonic adenomas. It’s possible to differentiate adenoma from colon carcinoma by assessing the increase in the rate of glycolysis in carcinoma. [10]
Document 10 (Title: Triple-negative breast cancer): Pre-clinical research/speculations Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC) have, on average, significantly higher fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake (measured by the SUVmax values) compared with uptake in ER+/PR+/HER2- tumors using fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET). It is speculated that enhanced glycolysis in these tumors is probably related to their aggressive biology. The widely used diabetes drug, metformin, holds promise for the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer. In addition metformin may influence cancer cells through indirect (insulin-mediated) effects, or it may directly affect cell proliferation and apoptosis of cancer cells. Epidemiologic and preclinical lab studies indicate that metformin has anti-tumor effects, via at least two mechanisms, both involving activation of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). A large-scale phase III trial of metformin in the adjuvant breast cancer setting is being planned in 2009.
Document 11 (Title: Primary and metastatic breast carcinoma: initial clinical evaluation with PET with the radiolabeled glucose analogue 2-[F-18]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose.): The authors assessed whether breast cancers can be detected by means of positron emission tomography (PET) with the positron-emitter-labeled glucose analogue 2-[fluorine-18]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG). In 12 patients with primary and/or metastatic breast cancer, PET images of F-18 distribution in vivo were obtained approximately 1 hour after intravenous injection of 10 mCi of FDG. Scan findings were correlated with other imaging data and physical examination and biopsy results. Ten of 10 primary breast cancers were imaged by means of FDG PET with a tumor:background FDG uptake ratio of 8.1 (median). Ten of 10 bone metastases were imaged with a tumor:normal bone uptake ratio of 6.05 (median). Five of five known soft-tissue metastases and four previously unsuspected nodal lesions were found with PET. No false-positive foci of FDG uptake were demonstrated. In two cases with negative mammograms due to dense breast parenchyma, FDG PET clearly delineated the primary tumors. These preliminary data demonstrate the feasibility and substantial potential of PET scanning with FDG to detect and localize both primary and metastatic breast cancers.
Document 12 (Title: Gardasil): The FDA approved Gardasil 9 for women and men aged 27 to 45 based on the vaccine being 88% effective against persistent HPV infections that cause certain types genital warts and cancers in females. Vaccine efficacy in males in this age group was inferred. Efficacy A 2020 longitudinal study tracking over 1,600 Swedish girls and women over an eleven year period found half as many cervical cancer cases in all women who had been vaccinated, and amongst women who had been vaccinated before the age of 17 a 78% reduction in cervical cancer, "a substantially reduced risk of invasive cervical cancer at the population level." An alternative vaccine known as Cervarix protects against two oncogenic strains of HPV, 16 and 18.
Document 13 (Title: Nuclear Medicine PET/CT Breast Cancer Assessment, Protocols, and Interpretation -- Indications): Currently, FDG PET/CT does not have a role in screening for breast cancer. Studies have found FDG PET/CT to be most clinically useful in staging recurrent or metastatic breast cancer in addition to the evaluation of the response of locally advanced breast cancer during neoadjuvant and post-treatment. Currently, FDG is the main radiotracer utilized in clinical practice though studies have found 18F-Fluoroestradiol to be used in imaging estrogen receptor expression. [2] The clinical indications for FDG PET/CT in patients with breast cancer routinely reimbursed by Centers for Medicare and Medicaid services include locoregional staging, axillary nodal disease in high-risk patients, internal mammary nodal status, systemic staging, and in the evaluation for skeletal metastatic involvement. [3]
Document 14 (Title: PET-fluorodeoxyglucose of cranial and spinal neuromas.): Five patients with eighth nerve, one with ninth nerve and one with cervical neuromas were studied with PET and [18F] fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). Four of the patients had had surgery prior to the PET study, and six patients had subsequent surgery. All tumors were well-visualized on the PET images. Only one patient with bilateral acoustic neuroma exhibited tumor recurrence or growth after the PET study; these two lesions showed the highest FDG uptakes in the PET studies (tumor-to-cerebellum ratio of 0.93-0.98). All other tumors were relatively hypometabolic (tumor-cerebellum ratios of 0.43-0.65) and showed no tumor growth or recurrence during follow-up periods ranging from 5 to 8 yr. These results suggest that PET-FDG may be of value in the evaluation of cranial and spinal schwannomas.
Document 15 (Title: Cervical lymph nodes): Clinical significance Infectious mononucleosis (glandular fever) affects the cervical lymph nodes which become swollen. The characterization of cancerous lymph nodes on CT scan, MRI or ultrasound is difficult, and usually requires confirmation by other nuclear imaging techniques such as PET scans. Tissue diagnosis by fine needle aspiration (which has a high rate of accuracy), may also be required. Involvement of the cervical lymph nodes with metastatic cancer is the single most important prognostic factor in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and may be associated with a halving of survival. Where the cancer has penetrated the capsule of the lymph gland (extracapsular extension) survival may be decreased by a further 50%. Other important factors are the level, the number of nodes and their size, which are also correlated with the risk of distant metastases. Cervical lymph node metastasis is also a common feature of papillary thyroid carcinoma. Additional images References
