Document 1 (Title: Sultamicillin versus trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole in the treatment of urinary tract infections.): Sultamicillin, a novel compound in which ampicillin and the beta-lactamase inhibitor sulbactam are linked as a double ester, was compared with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole with regard to in vitro activity, therapeutic efficacy and safety in the treatment of UTIs. The MICs of ampicillin and ampicillin in combination with sulbactam (10 micrograms), trimethoprim and trimethoprim in combination with sulfamethoxazole (1:19) were determined for 400 isolates causing UTI using an agar dilution technique (multipointer, cfu = 10(4]. The organisms isolated consisted of about one-third E. coli, one-third other Gram-negative strains and one-third Gram-positive strains. About half of the Gram-positive strains were enterococci and the other half staphylococci. A concentration of 8 micrograms/ml ampicillin inhibited 76% of the isolates while ampicillin in combination with sulbactam inhibited 86%. A concentration of 4 micrograms/ml trimethoprim inhibited 77% of the isolates, while trimethoprim in combination with sulfamethoxazole inhibited 83%. In a prospectively randomized clinical trial, 38 patients with UTI were treated orally with either sultamicillin (375 mg) or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (160 mg/800 mg) twice daily for 7 d. Sultamicillin eradicated bacteriuria during therapy and up to 1 to 2 weeks after therapy in 63% and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole in 50% of evaluable patients. Side effects were reported for 2 sultamicillin (gastric pain, diarrhea) and 2 trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole patients (gastric pain, exanthema), with the latter 2 being withdrawn after 6 days of therapy. Sultamicillin appeared as effective and safe as trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole in the treatment of UTI.

Nelfinavir: [P] Increased estrogen metabolism, possible reduction in oral contraceptive efficacy. Nevirapine: [NP] Increased estrogen metabolism, possible reduction in oral contraceptive efficacy.
Document 3 (Title: Emergency contraception): Types A variety of emergency contraceptive pills are available, including combined estrogen and progestin pills; progestin-only (levonorgestrel, LNG) pills; and antiprogestin (ulipristal acetate or mifepristone) pills. Progestin-only and anti-progestin pills are available as specifically packaged pills for use as emergency contraceptive pills. Emergency contraceptive pills originally contained higher doses of the same hormones (estrogens, progestins, or both) found in regular combined oral contraceptive pills. Combined estrogen and progestin pills are no longer recommended as dedicated emergency contraceptive pills (because this regimen is less effective and caused more nausea), but certain regular combined oral contraceptive pills (taken 2-5 at a time in what was called "the Yuzpe regimen") have also been shown to be effective as emergency contraceptive pills.
Document 4 (Title: Progestins -- Contraindications): Women who have undergone bariatric surgery and those taking certain medications that induce hepatic enzymes, such as antibiotics (rifampin), antifungals (griseofulvin), and anticonvulsants (phenytoin, carbamazepine, topiramate, and barbiturates) are advised not to use combined or progestin-only contraception. [10] [17] [18]
Document 5 (Title: Postpartum Care of the New Mother -- Function -- Components of Postpartum Care): Contraception: The prenatal period is the best time to discuss postpartum contraception. Adolescents begin motivational interviewing and discussion of long-acting reversible contraception during pregnancy. [16] For breastfeeding women, nonhormonal modalities are usually preferred. The ACOG recommends progestin-only contraceptives as the best hormonal contraceptive modality for breastfeeding women. Breastfeeding mothers should not use combination estrogen-progestin contraceptives as it can interfere with breast milk production. [17] Among hormonal methods, combined estrogen-progestin vaginal rings can be used after 4 weeks postpartum. Hormonal methods such as progestin-only oral contraceptives, depot medroxyprogesterone acetate injections, and progestin implants are preferred, as they do not affect milk production. A vaginal diaphragm and cervical cap should be fitted only after complete involution of the uterus, at 6 to 8 weeks after delivery. Intrauterine devices are typically best placed after 4 to 6 weeks after delivery. Breastfeeding is not an effective contraceptive choice. The lactational amenorrhea method alone or other forms of contraception has a failure rate of 2%, but a specific criterion has to be fulfilled. The woman must be breastfeeding exclusively on demand to be amenorrheic) ie, no vaginal bleeding after 8 weeks postpartum), and have an infant younger than 6 months. This becomes less reliable as the infant starts to eat solid foods. Both breastfeeding and non-breast-feeding women can use barrier contraceptives, intrauterine devices (copper-releasing and hormone-releasing), and progestin-only contraception. WHO recommends breastfeeding women wait 6 weeks postpartum before starting progestin-only contraceptives. ACOG recommends combination hormonal contraceptive use should not start until 3 weeks postpartum because of the increased risk of thromboembolism. Women should wait at least 6-18 months before trying to become pregnant again.
Document 6 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): ■ HORMONAL CONTRACEPTION (ORAL, PARENTERAL, & IMPLANTED CONTRACEPTIVES) A large number of oral contraceptives containing estrogens or progestins (or both) are now available for clinical use (Table 40–3). These preparations vary chemically and pharmacologically and have many properties in common as well as definite differences important for the correct selection of the optimum agent. Two types of preparations are used for oral contraception: (1) combinations of estrogens and progestins and (2) continuous progestin therapy without concomitant administration of estrogens. The combination agents are further divided into monophasic forms (constant dosage of both components during the cycle) and biphasic or triphasic forms (dosage of one or both components is changed once or twice during the cycle). The preparations for oral use are all adequately absorbed, and in combination preparations the pharmacokinetics of neither drug is significantly altered by the other.
Document 7 (Title: Progestins -- Adverse Effects -- Progestin-Only Contraception): The DMPA injection can delay returning to fertility for as long as 18 months after it is discontinued and should not be chosen by women considering pregnancy within the next 2 years. [16] According to the US Box Warning for DPMA, it is not recommended for long-term use (>2 years) as a birth control method or as medical therapy for endometriosis-associated pain unless other options are considered inadequate. The warning also includes the following claims not directly addressed previously: (1) prolonged use of DPMA may result in a loss of bone mineral density, and (2) the incidence of probable dementia increased in women ≥65 years old taking conjugated estrogen in combination with DMPA.
Document 8 (Title: Combined oral contraceptive pill): Combined oral contraception decreases total testosterone levels by approximately 0.5 nmol/l, free testosterone by approximately 60%, and increases the amount of sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) by approximately 100 nmol/l. Contraceptives containing second generation progestins and/or estrogen doses of around 20 –25 mg EE were found to have less impact on SHBG concentrations. Combined oral contraception may also reduce bone density. Drug interactions Some drugs reduce the effect of the pill and can cause breakthrough bleeding, or increased chance of pregnancy. These include drugs such as rifampicin, barbiturates, phenytoin and carbamazepine. In addition cautions are given about broad spectrum antibiotics, such as ampicillin and doxycycline, which may cause problems "by impairing the bacterial flora responsible for recycling ethinylestradiol from the large bowel" (BNF 2003).
Document 9 (Title: Comparison of birth control methods): Oral contraceptives are another option, these are commonly known as 'the pill'. These are prescribed by a doctor and must be taken at the same time everyday in order to be the most effective. There are two different options, there is a combined pill option that contains both of the hormones estrogen and progestin. The other option is a progestin only pill. The failure rate of both of these oral contraceptives is 7%. Some choose to get an injection or a shot in order to prevent pregnancy. This is an option where a medical professional will inject the hormone progestin into a woman's arm or buttocks every 3 months to prevent pregnancy. The failure rate is 4%. Women can also get an implant into their upper arm that releases small amounts of hormones to prevent pregnancy. The implant is a thin rod shaped device that contains the hormone progestin that is inserted into the upper arm and can prevent pregnancy for up to 3 years. The failure rate is 0.1%.
Document 10 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Drugs may cause intrahepatic cholestasis that is usually reversible after discontinuation of the offending agent, although it may take many months for cholestasis to resolve. Drugs most commonly associated with cholestasis are the anabolic and contraceptive steroids. Cholestatic hepatitis has been reported with chlorpromazine, imipramine, tolbutamide, sulindac, cimetidine, and erythromycin estolate. It also occurs in patients taking trimethoprim; sulfamethoxazole; and penicillin-based antibiotics such as ampicillin, dicloxacillin, and clavulanic acid. Rarely, cholestasis may be chronic and associated with progressive fibrosis despite early discontinuation of the offending drug. Chronic cholestasis has been associated with chlorpromazine and prochlorperazine.
Document 11 (Title: Treatment of traveler's diarrhea with sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim and loperamide.): In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 227 US adults with acute diarrhea in Mexico received a single dose of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim (1600/320 mg) or 3 days of therapy with loperamide hydrochloride (4-mg loading dose, then 2 mg orally after each loose stool), sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (800/160 mg orally twice daily), or the combination of both. Subjects treated with the combination had the shortest average duration of diarrhea compared with the placebo group (1 hour vs 59 hours), took the least amount of loperamide after the loading dose (3.8 mg), and had the shortest duration of diarrhea associated with fecal leukocytes or blood-tinged stools (4.5 hours). A single dose of sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim was also efficacious (28 vs 59 hours), but loperamide alone was significantly effective only when treatment failures were treated with antibiotics (33 vs 58 hours). The combination of sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim plus loperamide can be highly recommended for the treatment of most patients with traveler's diarrhea.
Document 12 (Title: Progestogen (medication)): Estrogens induce the production of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) in the liver. As such, SHBG levels indicate hepatic estrogenic exposure and may be a reliable surrogate marker for coagulation and VTE risk with estrogen therapy. Combined birth control pills containing different progestins result in SHBG levels that are increased 1.5- to 2-fold with levonorgestrel, 2.5- to 4-fold with desogestrel and gestodene, 3.5- to 4-fold with drospirenone and dienogest, and 4- to 5-fold with cyproterone acetate. SHBG levels differ depending on the progestin because androgenic progestins oppose the effect of ethinylestradiol on hepatic SHBG production as with its procoagulatory effects. Contraceptive vaginal rings and contraceptive patches likewise have been found to increase SHBG levels by 2.5-fold and 3.5-fold, respectively. Birth control pills containing high doses of ethinylestradiol (>50 μg) can increase SHBG levels by 5- to 10-fold, which is similar to the increase that occurs during
Document 13 (Title: [Current status of gestagen administration. 2. Gestagen therapy in the area of reproduction].): The spectrum of progestin therapy has changed and expanded during the last few years. 1. The drug-therapy of choice in endometriosis is the medication of progestins for at least six months, for instance ethinyl-testosterone. If a patient wants additional children the "more gentle" dydrogesterone should be considered. 2. In the treatment of dysmenorrhea combination pills should be given, sequentials should be avoided. In the case of incompatibility of estrogens or in danger of oversuppression syndrome dydrogesterone should be applicated. 3. Dysfunctional bleedings should lead to an intense search for their cause. The treatment consists in an estrogen-progestin combination for 9 days and in cyclic continuation of this therapy for at least a further three months. In the case of hemorrhagic diathesis progestin treatment should be continued. 4. Cyclic adequate progestins have proofed to be successful in handling of hirsutism. The choice of the preparation depends on the patient's wish for children. 5. The progestin test is still the first step in diagnosis of amenorrhea. 6. Progestin therapy is indicated in progressive endometrial carcinoma. Some medical centres treat carcinoma of the mamma successfully with progestins. 7. Nowadays fast and early hormonal pregnancy tests are available. The progestin-pregnancy-test is limited to cases of premenopause. 8. The so-called short luteum phase has received considerable attention as a possible cause of infertility. In these cases a substitutional therapy of progestins should follow. Clomiphene or HCG-therapy is advisable. In short luteum phase and premenstrual spottings potent progestins should be given. 9. High dosage of progestins are in common use in the treatment of abortus imminens. 10. Combination pills and sequentials are widely used, the possible methods of a pure progestin contraception are: minipills, three-month-injections, implanted silastic capsules with progestional compounds, progestin impregnated intrauterine devices, vaginal silastic rings impregnated with progestional compounds. 11. Carcinogenesis of progestins was not detectable. 12. Some progestins are teratogenic.
Document 14 (Title: Progestins -- Indications): Progestins are used in medications primarily for contraception, either alone or in combination with estrogen and postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy (HRT), but they are also used in the treatment and management of a variety of other conditions. The contraceptive vaginal ring and the transdermal patch contain an estrogen and progestin combination. There are no differences in contraceptive efficacy among various progestins in combined (estrogen and progestin) oral contraceptives (COC). In women who use COCs, there is a decrease in the risk of endometrial and ovarian cancer. Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) use also has been shown to reduce endometrial and ovarian cancer. There is a lack of data on progestin-only pills (POP), progestin-containing implants, and intrauterine devices (IUD).
Document 15 (Title: Gynecology_Novak): Use of combination estrogen–progestin hormonal methods (OCs, the patch, and the ring) is generally not advised during lactation because they reduce the amount and quality of breast milk. Combination hormonal methods can be used after 6 weeks, once milk production is established. Progestin-only OCs, implants, and injectable contraception do not affect milk quality or quantity (16). Labeling of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and guidelines from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists suggest that progestinonly OCs can be started 2 to 3 days postpartum, whereas depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (Depo Provera) injections or implants can begin at 6 weeks (19). These recommendations are not based on any observed adverse effect of early administration, and many maternity programs begin injectable contraception with progestin at the time of hospital discharge. Barrier methods, spermicides, and the copper T380A intrauterine device (IUD) (ParaGard) are good options
