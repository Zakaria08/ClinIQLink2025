Document 1 (Title: Direct therapeutic exposure): Direct therapeutic exposure (DTE) is a behavior therapy technique pioneered by Patrick A. Boudewyns, where stressors are vividly and safely confronted to help combat veterans, and patients suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), panic disorder, or phobias. Exposure therapy has supporting evidence with both simple and complex traumas. A similar therapy is Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR). First known publication in book form is Flooding and Implosive Therapy: Direct Therapeutic Exposure in Clinical Practice by Patrick A. Boudewyns, Robert H. Shipley. 1983. . It is not uncommon to combine DTE treatment with other therapies. Use Direct exposure has been used with a variety of populations including agoraphobia and chronic PTSD It involves as the name applies placing the client either real or imaginally in the feared situation.
Document 2 (Title: Using anticoagulants safely. Guidelines for therapeutic and prophylactic regimens.): Heparin and warfarin sodium (Coumadin, Panwarfin, Sofarin) are used most often to treat acute and recurrent venous thromboembolic disease, arterial disease, valvular heart disease, and atrial fibrillation. These agents along with dextran, pneumatic compression devices, and gradient stockings are also used to prevent deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in patients at high risk (eg, those with venous stasis, lower limb or spinal cord trauma, clotting abnormalities). Anticoagulation therapy is monitored by maintaining the activated partial thromboplastin time and the prothrombin time in the therapeutic range.
Document 3 (Title: Trauma-Informed Therapy -- Function): Trauma-focused psychotherapy is defined as any therapy that uses cognitive, emotional, or behavioral techniques to facilitate the processing of a traumatic experience, with the trauma focus being a central component of the therapeutic process. [7] Trauma-informed therapy encompasses a range of therapeutic modalities aimed at addressing the complex needs of individuals affected by trauma. These therapies are applied in behavioral health contexts to create a safe and supportive environment that fosters healing and resilience while integrating trauma awareness into every facet of care.
Document 4 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): bleeding Like the situation with heparin, bleeding with LMWH is more common in patients receiving concomitant therapy with anti-platelet or fibrinolytic drugs. Recent surgery, trauma, or underlying hemostatic defects also increase the risk of bleeding with LMWH. Although protamine sulfate can be used as an antidote for LMWH, protamine sulfate incompletely neutralizes the anticoagulant activity of LMWH because it only binds the longer chains of LMWH. Because longer chains are responsible for catalysis of thrombin inhibition by antithrombin, protamine sulfate completely reverses the anti-factor IIa activity of LMWH. In contrast, protamine sulfate only partially reverses the anti-factor Xa activity of LMWH because the shorter pentasaccharide-containing chains of LMWH do not bind to protamine sulfate. Consequently, patients at high risk for bleeding may be more safely treated with continuous IV unfractionated heparin than with SC LMWH.
Document 5 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): have manifestations of lower extremity VTE and absolute contraindications to anticoagulation, those that have a bleeding complication from anticoagulation therapy of acute VTE, or those who develop recurrent DVT or PE despite adequate anticoagula-tion therapy and for patients with severe pulmonary hypertension.When possible, anticoagulation therapy should be contin-ued in patients with vena cava filters. The duration of antico-agulation is determined by the underlying VTE and not by the presence of the IVC filter itself. Practically speaking, however, many patients who require an IVC filter for recurrent VTE are the same ones who would benefit most from indefinite antico-agulation. In patients who are not able to receive anticoagulants due to recent surgery or trauma, the clinician should continually reassess if anticoagulation may be started safely at a later date.Placement of permanent IVC filters has been evaluated as an adjunct to routine anticoagulation in patients with proximal
Document 6 (Title: Trauma-Informed Therapy -- Introduction -- Trauma-Informed Care (Clinician Level)): Trauma-informed therapy emphasizes shifting the focus from "What's wrong with you?" to "What happened to you?" This approach provides a framework for understanding and responding to the effects of trauma, prioritizing the creation of a safe, supportive, and empowering environment for individuals who have experienced trauma. This therapy involves recognizing the prevalence and impact of trauma, understanding its effects on individuals, and integrating this awareness into all aspects of therapeutic practice. [6]
Document 7 (Title: Trauma-Informed Therapy -- Continuing Education Activity): Objectives: Identify the various manifestations and effects of trauma in individuals, including cognitive, emotional, and physical impacts. Implement trauma-informed practices in therapeutic settings to create a safe and supportive environment for patients. Apply trauma-informed principles to develop individualized treatment strategies that address the unique experiences and needs of trauma survivors. Collaborate with an interprofessional healthcare team to integrate trauma-informed approaches across all aspects of patient care and support. Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.
Document 8 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Patients undergoing tooth extraction or alveolar and gingival surgery rarely experience uncontrolled bleeding when warfarin anticoagulation is maintained within the therapeutic range currently recommended for prevention of venous thrombosis, atrial fibrillation, or mechanical heart valve. Embolic complications and death, however, have been reported during subtherapeutic anticoagulation. Therapeutic anticoagulation should be confirmed before and continued through the procedure. Likewise, low-dose aspirin (e.g., 81–325 mg) can safely be continued. For patients taking aspirin and another antiplatelet medication (e.g., clopidogrel), the decision to continue the second antiplatelet
Document 9 (Title: Morita therapy): As clients move through the four stages, their senses are activated and curiosity about the natural world increases. Herein, they engage and respond more spontaneously and creatively, while gaining a sense of their authentic self (Fujita, C., 1986. Morita Therapy: A Psychotherapeutic System for Neurosis. Tokyo: Igaku-Shoin). For Morita, it was the progressive design and ecological context that made it unique to other therapies of his time, as well as today. Therapeutic change runs deeper than thinking and behaving. One's perception of self-in-the-world shifts while moving through the therapeutic stages. A client's mind, body, and imagination have therapeutic time in a safe place in a natural environment to become revitalized; this is particularly necessary when they have survived trauma ('Classic Morita Therapy'). For instance, while pulling weeds and watching earthworms seek moist soil, they notice that their anxiety has dissipated and they soon embody such experiences. It is the
Document 10 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): prophylactic anticoagulants should be used during hospitalization and in nonambulatory patients. Those who have had either a deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolus can receive therapeutic doses of anticoagulation safely and without increasing the risk for hemorrhage into the tumor. Inferior vena cava filters are reserved for patients with absolute contraindications to anticoagulation such as recent craniotomy.
Document 11 (Title: Percutaneous ibuprofen therapy with Trauma-Dolgit gel: bioequivalence studies.): The plasma and tissue kinetics of ibuprofen after topical application of 5% Trauma-Dolgit gel were determined in two bioequivalence studies. In eight patients, high ibuprofen concentrations, largely within the therapeutic range, were found in subcutaneous tissue, tendon, muscles and joint capsule. In plasma, however, very low concentrations (decimal exponents below the therapeutically relevant plasma ibuprofen level even after repeated application) were found in nine volunteers. Based upon the comparison of oral and topical ibuprofen forms, the test preparation was found to be bioequivalent and, from a kinetic viewpoint, safe and effective.
Document 12 (Title: Vascular trauma secondary to diagnostic and therapeutic procedures: laparoscopy.): Diagnostic and therapeutic laparoscopy are safe procedures that only rarely cause significant morbidity. However, major abdominal arterial and venous injury may occur, requiring prompt recognition and laparotomy. Direct compression will control major hemorrhage until resuscitation is complete. Vascular repair utilizing principles of proximal and distal control, good exposure, appropriate anticoagulation, and lateral suture technic should result in restoration of normal blood flow without significant sequelae.
Document 13 (Title: Psychological trauma): Diana Fosha, a pioneer of modern psychodynamic perspective, also argues that social relations can help people recover from trauma, but specifically refers to attachment theory and the attachment dynamic of the therapeutic relationship. Fosha argues that the sense of emotional safety and co-regulation that occurs in a psychodynamically-oriented therapeutic relationship acts as the secure attachment that is necessary to allow a client to experience and process through their trauma safely and effectively. Stress disorders
Document 14 (Title: Perioperative Anticoagulation Management -- Evaluation -- Determine the Procedural Bleeding Risk): Another common scenario is the patient with coronary stents, most of which are on dual anti-aggregation. Approximately 5% of these patients require surgery during the next year after coronary stent implantation. Suppose aspirin and thienopyridine need to be suspended during the perioperative period. In that case, the elective surgical procedure should be delayed 6 weeks for patients with bare-metal stents and 6 months for drug-eluting stents. [4] [12] In case the elective surgery cannot be postponed, the dual anti-aggregation therapy should be continued throughout the perioperative period. [21] [22] Despite limited evidence, there are scenarios where anticoagulation therapy continuation is preferable in patients with low bleeding risk. Dental procedures are considered low-bleeding-risk procedures. Most evidence comes from patients receiving warfarin with a therapeutic INR range. The studies conclude that continuing anticoagulation therapy is safe, not only in dental extraction but in other dental procedures, and that bridging therapy could be related to even more bleeding associated with these procedures. [23] [24] One 4-year, cross-sectional study assessed bleeding risk in patients with DOACs, showing no significant bleeding association with continuing anticoagulation therapy.
Document 15 (Title: Oral anticoagulant therapy: practical considerations.): The key to safe and effective oral anticoagulation is to have an understanding of the rationale for dosing guidelines and therapeutic ranges; an appreciation of the imprecision of prothrombin time testing and its standardization; knowledge of the factors influencing prothrombin time response; and awareness of the importance of patient empowerment via ongoing patient education. This review focuses on the routine management of oral anticoagulant therapy to provide these practical insights and to promote safe and effective therapy.
