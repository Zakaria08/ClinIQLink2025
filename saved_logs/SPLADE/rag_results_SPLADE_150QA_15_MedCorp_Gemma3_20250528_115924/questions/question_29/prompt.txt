Document 1 (Title: [MRI findings of brain-stem tuberculoma in a case of tuberculous meningitis].): A 54-year-old woman developed headache and slight fever. When she consulted a physician, she could not move either of her eyes to the right. Cranial CT scan revealed no significant findings. Lumbar puncture was performed and CSF examination showed the cell count of 10,304/mm3, glucose level of 10 mg/dl, and total protein value of 270 mg/dl. Her symptoms and laboratory findings suggested meningitis and she was admitted to our hospital. Neurological examination revealed bilateral dilated pupils with sluggish light reflex, right gaze palsy, and hypesthesia of the left side of her face. A diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis was established by a positive test for acid-fast bacillus in CSF, and anti-tuberculous therapy was started at once. One month after the onset of symptoms, her main complaints were double vision and cerebellar ataxia. Both CT and MRI revealed a right brain-stem lesion. Pre-contrast CT could not clearly visualize the lesion but with contrast medium a homogeneously-enhanced circular lesion was shown. MRI on T2WI demonstrated the right brain-stem lesion to have a central bright core with hypointense periphery, which in turn was surrounded by hyperintensity. The lesion appeared isointense with cerebral white matter and the "central bright core" area was demonstrated to be slightly hypointense on T1WI. On post-contrast T1WI (with Gd-DTPA), the lesion showed strong homogeneous enhancement. The CT and MRI findings indicated a brain-stem tuberculoma, which was regarded as the cause of the ocular movement paralysis and cerebellar ataxia. As the clinical symptoms gradually resolved with anti-tuberculous treatment, the MRI appearance of the lesion also improved.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Document 2 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): Introduction to Autonomic Pharmacology Bertram G. Katzung, MD, PhD A 56-year-old woman is brought to the university eye center with a complaint of “loss of vision.” Because of visual impair-ment, she has lost her driver’s license and has fallen several times in her home. Examination reveals that her eyelids close involuntarily with a frequency and duration sufficient to pre-vent her from seeing her surroundings for more than brief moments at a time. When she holds her eyelids open with her fingers, she can see normally. She has no other muscle dysfunction. A diagnosis of blepharospasm is made. Using a fine needle, several injections of botulinum toxin type A are made in the orbicularis oculi muscle of each eyelid. After observation in the waiting area, she is sent home. Two days later, she reports by telephone that her vision has improved dramatically. How did botulinum toxin improve her vision? How long can her vision be expected to remain normal after this single treatment?
Document 3 (Title: Eye examination): If there is a small, irregular pupil that constricts poorly to light, but normally to accommodation, this is an Argyll Robertson pupil. Ocular motility Ocular motility should always be tested, especially when patients complain of double vision or physicians suspect neurologic disease. First, the doctor should visually assess the eyes for deviations that could result from strabismus, extraocular muscle dysfunction, or palsy of the cranial nerves innervating the extraocular muscles. Saccades are assessed by having the patient move his or her eye quickly to a target at the far right, left, top and bottom. This tests for saccadic dysfunction whereupon poor ability of the eyes to "jump" from one place to another may impinge on reading ability and other skills, whereby the eyes are required to fixate and follow a desired object.
Document 4 (Title: Root Cause Analysis and Medical Error Prevention -- Function -- Case example 1): A 42-year-old primigravida woman at 34 weeks gestation was brought to the obstetric emergency department at midnight with complaints of severe headache, blurry vision, and right upper quadrant pain for the last 5 to 6 hours. She noted lower extremity edema and facial swelling that was gradually increasing. She has gestational hypertension and, 1 week ago, was prescribed labetalol 200 mg twice a day. On initial presentation, her blood pressure was 190/110 mm Hg on 2 separate occasions, 5 minutes apart. She had gained 2 kilograms since her last antenatal checkup in the clinic a week ago. The patient was diagnosed with severe preeclampsia. The senior obstetric resident ordered a loading dose of magnesium sulfate to prevent imminent seizure. The hospital protocol used an intravenous (IV) and intramuscular (IM) regimen where the patient received a 4 g IV bolus and a 10 g IM dose administered as 5 g in each buttock. The senior resident gave verbal orders for magnesium sulfate administration to the junior resident, who verbally communicated the order to the nurse.
Document 5 (Title: Giant cell arteritis): Diagnosis Physical exam Palpation of the head reveals prominent temporal arteries with or without pulsation. The temporal area may be tender. Decreased pulses may be found throughout the body Evidence of ischemia may be noted on fundal exam. Bruits may be heard over the subclavian and axillary arteries Laboratory tests Erythrocyte sedimentation rate, an inflammatory marker, >60 mm/hour (normal 1–40 mm/hour). C-reactive protein, another inflammatory marker, may be elevated. LFTs, liver function tests, are abnormal particularly raised ALP- alkaline phosphatase Platelets may also be elevated. Biopsy
Document 6 (Title: Granuloma Inguinale -- Epidemiology): Govender et al reported 2 cases where young children were diagnosed with donovanosis with no history of sexual exposure. An 8-month-old female presented with a right ear mass and discharge. She was initially treated with antibiotics and surgical resection but did not follow up for 8 months. When she presented again, she was found to have progressed in symptomatology and had a new right temporal lobe abscess. She required a craniectomy to drain the abscess, as well as a mastoidectomy. Tissue was removed during the surgery for analysis, and the diagnosis of granuloma inguinale was made. Questioning of the parents revealed no signs or symptoms of sexual abuse. No gynecological exam was performed on the patient’s mother, so it is unknown if she had a genital ulcer. The patient was treated with erythromycin with noted improvement in the right temporal lobe lesion noted on computed tomography before discharge. The patient and her family were unavailable for follow-up after discharge. [2]
Document 7 (Title: Case Study: 33-Year-Old Female Presents with Chronic SOB and Cough (Archived) -- Case Presentation): History of Present Illness: A 33-year-old white female presents after admission to the general medical/surgical hospital ward with a chief complaint of shortness of breath on exertion. She reports that she was seen for similar symptoms previously at her primary care physician’s office six months ago. At that time, she was diagnosed with acute bronchitis and treated with bronchodilators, empiric antibiotics, and a short course oral steroid taper. This management did not improve her symptoms, and she has gradually worsened over six months. She reports a 20-pound (9 kg) intentional weight loss over the past year. She denies camping, spelunking, or hunting activities. She denies any sick contacts. A brief review of systems is negative for fever, night sweats, palpitations, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, neural sensation changes, muscular changes, and increased bruising or bleeding. She admits a cough, shortness of breath, and shortness of breath on exertion.
Document 8 (Title: [Recurrent episodic unilateral mydriasis with pleocytosis in the cerebrospinal fluid--a case report].): A 24-year-old female was admitted to our hospital on Aug. 20 in 1986 because of blurred vision and right pupillary dilatation. She had sometimes noticed headache later than 1976, and blurred vision without headache several times a year later than 1983. She had been told her right pupil dilated when she had complained of blurred vision. Neurological examination revealed abnormal findings as follows; diminished sense of smell in the right side, anisocoria (R 8 mm, L 5 mm), bilateral hippus, hypesthesioalgesia in her right face, left trunk and left arm. The pupils were round and contracted promptly to light. Accommodation reflex and ciliospinal reflexes were normal. Neither blepharoptosis nor external ocular muscle paresis were observed. Deep tendon reflexes were normal. Planter responses were flexor. There was no meningeal irritative sign. No abnormal findings were obtained in blood and urine, chest X-p, brain enhanced CT scan, EEG, and cerebral angiography except for slight degree of anemia. Serum TPHA was negative. However, the cell count of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was 18/mm3 (Ly 100%) and decreased to 9/mm3 (Ly 100%) in nine days. Protein content and glucose level of CSF were normal. Pupils were not constricted by 0.125% pilocarpine instillation. Loss of smell and sensory disturbance disappeared within three days and her pupils became isocoric by five days after admission. The patients of episodic unilateral mydriasis without apparent cause had relatively same clinical features as "unilateral springing pupil" proposed by Hallett et al. (1970). Except for mydriasis, they had no abnormal findings of neurological and laboratory examinations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Document 9 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): A 21-year-old woman comes with her parents to discuss therapeutic options for her Crohn’s disease. She was diag-nosed with Crohn’s disease 2 years ago, and it involves her terminal ileum and proximal colon, as confirmed by colonoscopy and small bowel radiography. She was initially treated with mesalamine and budesonide with good response, but over the last 2 months, she has had a relapse of her symptoms. She is experiencing fatigue, cramping, abdominal pains, and nonbloody diarrhea up to 10 times daily, and she has had a 15-lb weight loss. She has no other significant medical or surgical his-tory. Her current medications are mesalamine 2.4 g/d and budesonide 9 mg/d. She appears thin and tired. Abdominal examination reveals tenderness without guarding in the right lower quadrant; no masses are palpable. On perianal examination, there is no tenderness, fissure, or fistula. Her laboratory data are notable for anemia and elevated C-reactive protein. What are the options for immediate
Document 10 (Title: Anatomy_Gray): Most of these changes are transient and are usually due to traction injuries during the surgical procedure. A 33-year-old fit and well woman came to the emergency department complaining of double vision and pain behind her right eye. She had no other symptoms. On examination of the right eye the pupil was dilated. There was a mild ptosis. Testing of eye movement revealed that the eye turned down and out and the pupillary reflex was not present. These findings revealed that the patient had an ipsilateral third nerve palsy (palsy of the oculomotor nerve [III]). The oculomotor nerve [III] is the main motor nerve to the ocular and extra-ocular muscles. It arises from the midbrain and pierces the dura mater to run in the lateral wall of the cavernous sinus. The oculomotor nerve [III] leaves the cranial cavity and enters the orbit through the superior orbital fissure. Within this fissure it divides into its superior and inferior divisions.
Document 11 (Title: Ellen G. White): She did not breathe during the entire period of a vision that ranged from fifteen minutes to three hours. Yet, her pulse beat regularly and her countenance remained pleasant as in the natural state. Her eyes were always open without blinking; her head was raised, looking upward with a pleasant expression as if staring intently at some distant object. Several physicians, at different times, conducted tests to check her lack of breathing and other physical phenomena. She was utterly unconscious of everything transpiring around her, and viewed herself as removed from this world, and in the presence of heavenly beings. When she came out of vision, all seemed total darkness whether in the day time or a well-lighted room at night. She would exclaim with a long-drawn sigh, as she took her first natural breath, "D-a-r-k." She was then limp and strengthless.

Document 13 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): A 53-year-old woman with a history of knee osteoarthritis, high cholesterol, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension presents with new onset of hot flashes and a question about a dietary supplement. She is obese (body mass index [BMI] 33), does not exercise, and spends a good portion of her work day in a seated position. She eats a low-sugar diet and regularly eats packaged frozen meals for dinner because she doesn’t have time to cook regularly. Her most recent laboratory values include a low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol that is above goal at 160 mg/dL (goal < 100 mg/dL) and a hemo-globin A1c that is well controlled at 6%. Her blood pressure is high at 160/100 mm Hg. Her prescription medications include simvastatin, metformin, and benazepril. She also takes over-the-counter ibuprofen for occasional knee pain and a multivitamin supplement once daily. She has heard good things about natural products and asks you if taking a garlic supplement daily could help to bring her blood
Document 14 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): Roger J. Porter, MD, & Michael A. Rogawski, MD, PhD was unchanged, and levetiracetam was gradually increased to 1000 mg bid. The patient had no significant adverse effects from this dosage. At age 21, she had a second tonic-clonic seizure while in college; further discussion with her room-mate at that time revealed a history of two recent episodes of 1–2 minutes of altered consciousness with lip smacking (focal impaired awareness seizure, formerly complex partial seizure). A repeat EEG showed occasional right temporal spikes. What is one possible strategy for controlling her present symptoms? A 23-year-old woman presents to the office for consultation regarding her antiseizure medications. Seven years ago, this otherwise healthy young woman had a tonic-clonic seizure at home. She was rushed to the emergency department, at which time she was alert but complained of headache. A consulting neurologist placed her on levetiracetam, 500 mg bid. Four days later, electroencephalography (EEG)
Document 15 (Title: Pseudo-pseudo-Foster Kennedy syndrome.): An 80-year-old woman presented with a classic story and findings of an anterior ischemic optic neuropathy in her left eye. Her right eye had slow and progressive decreased vision, ostensibly secondary to a cataract. However, the right eye showed slight temporal pallor of the optic disc and a superior temporal field defect was found. Her radiologic exam showed a tuberculum sella meningioma extending into the right optic canal compressing the right optic nerve. Two diseases, ischemic optic neuropathy and meningioma, in one patient may be termed a pseudo-pseudo-Foster Kennedy syndrome.

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
Question: A 63-year-old woman presents to her primary-care doctor for a 2-month history of vision changes, specifically citing the gradual onset of double vision. Her double vision is present all the time and does not get better or worse throughout the day. She has also noticed that she has a hard time keeping her right eye open, and her right eyelid looks 'droopy' in the mirror. Physical exam findings during primary gaze are shown in the photo. Her right pupil is 6 mm and poorly reactive to light. The rest of her neurologic exam is unremarkable. Laboratory studies show an Hb A1c of 5.0%. Which of the following is the next best test for this patient?
Options:
A. Direct fundoscopy
B. Intraocular pressures
C. MR angiography of the head
D. Temporal artery biopsy
