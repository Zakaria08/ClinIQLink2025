This is usually observed in the face, hands, forearms, and lower legs. Healing is slow and leaves scarring. Though blisters are the most common skin manifestations of PCT, other skin manifestations include hyperpigmentation (similar to a tan) and hypertrichosis (mainly on the cheeks) also occur. PCT is a chronic condition, with external symptoms often subsiding and recurring as a result of multiple factors. In addition to the skin lesions, chronic liver disease is very common in patients with sporadic PCT. This involves hepatic fibrosis (scarring of the liver), and inflammation. However, liver problems are less common in patients with the inherited form of the disease. Additionally, patients will often void a wine-red color urine with an increased concentration of uroporphyrin I due to their enzymatic deficiency.",

        "content": "A 69-year-old white Italian woman was first seen at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in 1981 concerning several skin growths on her back. The patient had had several basal cell carcinomas surgically removed from her back during the preceding 5 years. There was no history of arsenic ingestion or prolonged sun exposure and her family history was negative for skin cancer. The patient had developed pulmonary tuberculosis in 1938 and was treated with pneumothorax therapy. She had had more than 50 fluoroscopic examinations of the chest following this therapy, as well as multiple diagnostic x-ray films since that time. She recalled that she had faced the fluoroscopy beam during the procedure. In 1959, she had a transabdominal hysterectomy for fibroid tumors. In 1980 she underwent a right modified radical mastectomy for adenoid cystic carcinoma of the breast; biopsies of lymph nodes were negative. Physical examination revealed a thin, white woman with a right mastectomy scar. On the back, clustered in the interscapular region, were multiple scars and nine erythematous nodules with pearly borders, telangiectasia, and translucent surfaces. Within several nodules there were areas of light and dark brown pigmentation. There were no other suspicious lesions on the head, chest, or extremities, nor did the patient show any evidence of the basal cell nevus syndrome. Biopsy of all lesions revealed basal cell carcinoma, some of which were pigmented, without evidence of chronic radiodermatitis. All lesions were treated with curettage and electrodesiccation three times with good cosmetic results (Fig. 1).",

Physical examination showed Gottron's papules on her fingers and a faint heliotrope rash. Biopsy of erythematous skin lesions on the shoulder and the back of the hand revealed perivascular inflammatory cell infiltration and tiny ulcerative lesions of the cutaneous tissue. Biopsy of the right quadriceps muscle showed type II fiber atrophy and slight perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate, whereas serum CPK level was within normal range. Chest X-ray film showed granular infiltrates in both lower lung fields. Based on the current findings the case was diagnosed as dermatomyositis associated with interstitial pneumonia.

        "content": "A 42-year-old primigravida\u00a0woman\u00a0at 34 weeks gestation was brought to the obstetric emergency department at midnight with complaints of severe headache, blurry vision, and right upper quadrant pain for the last\u00a05 to\u00a06 hours. She noted lower extremity edema and facial swelling that was gradually increasing. She has gestational hypertension and, 1 week ago, was prescribed labetalol 200 mg twice a day. On initial presentation, her blood pressure was 190/110 mm Hg on\u00a02 separate occasions, 5 minutes apart. She had gained\u00a02 kilograms since her last antenatal checkup in the clinic\u00a0a week ago. The patient was diagnosed with severe preeclampsia. The senior obstetric resident ordered\u00a0a loading dose of magnesium sulfate to prevent imminent seizure. The hospital protocol used an intravenous (IV) and intramuscular (IM) regimen where the patient received a 4 g IV bolus and a 10 g IM dose administered as 5 g in each buttock. The senior resident gave verbal orders for magnesium sulfate administration to the junior resident, who verbally communicated the order to the nurse.",

        "title": "[McArdle's disease without typical symptoms].",
        "content": "A 25-year-old female with McArdle's disease was reported. She had no characteristic symptoms for McArdle's disease such as muscle cramp and brown urine, but had general fatiguability from childhood. On examination, she showed no neurological abnormalities including muscle atrophy and weakness. On laboratory examination, serum creatinine kinase (CK) level was elevated, though serum lactic acid level remained unchanged after the ischemic forearm exercise test. Muscle biopsy from the biceps brachii showed almost completely absent phosphorylase activity both histochemically and biochemically. Thus, she was diagnosed as having McArdle's disease. The skinned fiber test of the muscle showed no enhanced Ca induced Ca release (CICR), and serum VLDL level was normal. Her 27-year-old elder brother had similar clinical symptoms and serological abnormalities and may also have McArdle's disease, although muscle biopsy was not performed. A possibility of McArdle's disease should be considered when we encounter a patient who has only general fatigue and high serum CK level.",
