Document 1 (Title: [Amblyopia: reading speed in comparison with visual acuity for gratings, single Landolt Cs and series Landolt Cs].): In the treatment of amblyopia in preschool children, a means of predicting later reading ability would be helpful. This prediction might be possible using a test for visual acuity where the results correlate with reading ability in adult patients with amblyopia. We measured the following four parameters in 18 experienced readers with strabismic amblyopia: (1) time spent reading ten lines of a standard text in one of three magnifications, (2) visual acuity for gratings, (3) visual acuity for single Landolt Cs, and (4) visual acuity for crowded Landolt Cs (one Landolt C flanked by two full rings on each side each at a distance of 2.6 min of arc). The reading text was presented on paper at a distance of 40 cm; the subject had a choice of three magnifications. The acuity tests were generated by a computer on a VDU at 4.6 m. The relative impairment of the amblyopic eye was defined as the quotient between the performance of the amblyopic and the good eye. In addition, the difference between the times spent reading the ten lines with the amblyopic and with the good eye was calculated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Document 2 (Title: Neurology_Adams): Impairment of visual function, expressed as defects in acuity and alterations of visual fields, obviously stands as the most important symptom of eye disease. A number of terms are commonly used to describe visual loss. Amaurosis is a general term that refers to partial or complete loss of sight. Amblyopia refers to any monocular deficit in vision that occurs in the presence of normal ocular structures. A major cause of amblyopia is the suppression by the brain of vision from one eye during early childhood caused by either strabismus, anisometropia (a significant difference in refractive error), or by media opacities. Nyctalopia is a term for poor twilight or night vision and is associated with extreme myopia, cataracts, vitamin A deficiency, retinitis pigmentosa, and, often, color blindness. There are also a number of positive visual symptoms that are named based on their characteristics, phosphenes, migrainous scintillations, visual illusions, and hallucinations. Irritation,
Document 3 (Title: Visual acuity): The precise distance at which acuity is measured is not important as long as it is sufficiently far away and the size of the optotype on the retina is the same. That size is specified as a visual angle, which is the angle, at the eye, under which the optotype appears. For 6/6 = 1.0 acuity, the size of a letter on the Snellen chart or Landolt C chart is a visual angle of 5 arc minutes (1 arc min = 1/60 of a degree). By the design of a typical optotype (like a Snellen E or a Landolt C), the critical gap that needs to be resolved is 1/5 this value, i.e., 1 arc min. The latter is the value used in the international definition of visual acuity:
Document 4 (Title: [The Teller Acuity Card Test: possibilities and limits of clinical use].): The Teller Acuity Card test was used to examine 49 normal children, 77 with strabismus, 9 with anisometropia and 19 with various organic ocular diseases. The vision of some of these children was also tested with the Landolt C and fixation preference tests. A comparison of the three tests showed that strabismic amblyopia is not reliably detected with the Teller Acuity Cards. On the other hand, this test appears to be a good one for detecting loss of acuity due to ocular diseases.
Document 5 (Title: Snellen Chart -- Definition/Introduction): Tumbling E: Dr. Snellen also developed this chart, which he designed for children and those unable to read or unfamiliar with the Roman alphabet. This chart displays a capital letter E facing in various directions. While observing each character, the patient points in the direction that the E is facing. Landolt C: Comparable to the Tumbling E, this chart displays a C - which some say appears more similar to a broken ring - facing in various directions. The chart was developed by the Swiss ophthalmologist Landolt and is regarded as a laboratory standard by the International Council of Ophthalmology. LEA Symbols Chart : This chart was designed for visual acuity screening in children to eliminate the problems of language barriers. The chart utilizes symbols and creates a play environment to entertain the pediatric patient during the exam. Vivekanand et al. determined that the LEA symbols chart performs better than the Snellen chart for visual acuity assessments in preschool children. [4]
Document 6 (Title: Visual Acuity -- Introduction): In the 1800s, there was a move to standardize visual testing, which led to the formation of several visual acuity charts with different optotypes. The first and still most widely used today is the Snellen chart. Other testing charts developed around that time include the Tumbling E chart, Landolt C chart, and Allen chart. More recently, the LogMAR chart (also known as ETDRS chart) has gained favor. The LogMAR chart provides more accurate results when compared to other visual acuity charts, and the results are more easily used in vision analysis, making it the preferred chart in clinical studies. [2]
Document 7 (Title: Pediatrics_Nelson): The most common cause of severe visual impairment in children is retinopathy of prematurity (see Chapter 61). Congenital cataracts may lead to significant amblyopia. Cataracts also are associated with other ocular abnormalities and developmental disabilities. Amblyopia is a pathologic alteration of the visual system characterized by a reduction in visual acuity in one or both eyes with no clinically apparent organic abnormality that completely accounts for the visual loss. Amblyopia is due to a distortion of the normal clearly formed retinal image (from congenital cataracts or severe refractive errors); abnormal binocular interaction between the eyes as one eye competitively inhibits the other (strabismus); or a combination of both mechanisms. Albinism, hydrocephalus, congenital cytomegalovirus infection, and birth asphyxia are other significant contributors to blindness in children.
Document 8 (Title: Snellen chart): Electronic chart To ensure adequate illumination of the Snellen charts, various medical device manufacturers had developed Snellen chart products with backlight or projection. Digital chart Since computer monitors typically have good lighting for reading and LCD/LED monitors have high DPI (between 96 and 480) they are suitable for displaying optotypes. Commonly digital chart products support randomizing optotypes displayed to prevent patients from cheating through memorizing the chart. In Google Play and App Store (iOS), there are Snellen chart apps for smart phones and tablets.

Document 9 (Title: Visual acuity): Expression Visual acuity is often measured according to the size of letters viewed on a Snellen chart or the size of other symbols, such as Landolt Cs or the E Chart. In some countries, acuity is expressed as a vulgar fraction, and in some as a decimal number. Using the metre as a unit of measurement, (fractional) visual acuity is expressed relative to 6/6. Otherwise, using the foot, visual acuity is expressed relative to 20/20. For all practical purposes, 20/20 vision is equivalent to 6/6. In the decimal system, acuity is defined as the reciprocal value of the size of the gap (measured in arc minutes) of the smallest Landolt C, the orientation of which can be reliably identified. A value of 1.0 is equal to 6/6.
Document 10 (Title: Landolt C): The stroke width is of the diameter, and the gap width is the same. This is identical to the letter C from a Snellen chart. The Landolt C is the standard optotype for acuity measurement in most European countries. It was standardized, together with measurement procedures, by the German DIN, as DIN 58220 (now EN ISO 8596). Although accepted as a 'gold standard', this optotype has its own inherent problems, possibly due to higher brain function where the gap will appear closed near the limit of resolution, especially when the gap is at the 6 o'clock position. This is not due to the structure of the cornea or lens, nor is it due to astigmatic errors. See also Edmund Landolt Visual acuity E chart Golovin–Sivtsev table References Ophthalmology Optotypes

Document 12 (Title: Pediatric Cataract -- History and Physical): Recognition acuity testing assesses the ability to recognize specific stimuli, encompassing direction identification using Landolt C or Snellen E tests, letter identification with Snellen charts or high-contrast optotype visual acuity (HOTV) tests, and picture identification with tools like Allen picture cards or Domino charts. Behavioral pattern assessment, through techniques like the Cardiff acuity test and optokinetic drum test, evaluates visual function indirectly by observing the child's response to visual stimuli. [43]
Document 13 (Title: Amblyopia): Diagnosis Amblyopia is diagnosed by identifying low visual acuity in one or both eyes, out of proportion to the structural abnormality of the eye and excluding other visual disorders as causes for the lowered visual acuity. It can be defined as an interocular difference of two lines or more in acuity (e.g. on Snellen chart) when the eye optics are maximally corrected. In young children, visual acuity is difficult to measure and can be estimated by observing the reactions of the patient when one eye is covered, including observing the patient's ability to follow objects with one eye.
Document 14 (Title: Tests for Potential Vision -- Procedures -- Visual Acuity): Although this is not a test for potential vision, it is a test that needs to be performed at the very beginning of the ocular examination. [4] Visual acuity is defined as the reciprocal of the minimum resolvable angle. It is a subjective method of assessing macular function. Different components of visual acuity include distance vision, near vision, color vision, and contrast sensitivity, which can be measured using different methods. [5] Distant vision – Snellen's chart, Landolt C chart, Sheridan Gardiner HOTV test. [6] Near vision – Jaeger chart, Roman chart, and Snellen near vision chart. [7] Color vision – Ishiharas pseudoisochromatic plates, Farnsworth Munsell 100 Hue test, Green lantern test and Anomaloscopes. [8] Contrast sensitivity – Pelli-Robson, Regan, Arden-Grating charts.

Document 15 (Title: Defective processing of motion-defined form in the fellow eye of patients with unilateral amblyopia.): The following three measurements were made on a group of 20 pediatric and 5 adult patients with unilateral amblyopia: (1) speed threshold for recognizing motion-defined dotted letters; (2) recognition acuity for isolated solid letters of 4% contrast; and (3) Snellen line acuity for high-contrast letters. Normal limits were established with a group of 30 pediatric and 10 adult control subjects. The main finding was that, in amblyopic children, a high percentage (83%, 15 of 18) of fellow eyes showed a degraded ability to recognize motion-defined letters, even though Snellen acuity and 4% letter acuity were normal for age. The fellow eyes of all nine patients with strabismic amblyopia showed this pattern of loss, as did four of six fellow eyes of patients with anisometropic amblyopia and two of three fellow eyes of patients with anisometropic plus strabismic amblyopia. Only two clinically unaffected eyes were normal for motion-defined letters. These eyes belonged to patients with anisometropic amblyopia. Eighteen of the 19 previously amblyopic eyes tested were abnormal for motion-defined letters even though Snellen acuity was within normal limits for 6 of these eyes. In adults, only one of five fellow eyes failed the motion-defined letter test. It was concluded that the degradation of form perception associated with amblyopia can be different for luminance-defined and motion-defined form and that defective processing of motion-defined form is common in the fellow eyes of children with unilateral amblyopia.
