On admission, he was able to walk with assistance, but his legs were severely spastic, and Babinski's sign was positive bilaterally. Superficial sensation was normal, but vibration sense was mildly decreased in his legs. CSF showed mild mononuclear pleocytosis with elevated protein. Myelogram and CT were normal. Serum and CSF antibodies to HTLV-I were positive at titers of X4,096 and X128, respectively by immunofluorescent assay, and specific IgG bands (p19, p24, p28 and p53 in serum and p19, p24, p53 in CSF) were detected by western blot analysis. His paraparesis continued to worsen. He became bed-ridden within 2 months. He was received corticosteroid medication. He regained the ability to walk with assistance, and continued taking corticosteroid.

Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed thoracic intramedullary tumor and multiple intracranial tumors in the right frontal convexity, the right lower surface of the tentorium and the right parietal parasagittal region. In December, he underwent craniotomy and the right frontal tumor was totally removed. It was diagnosed histologically as meningioma. Because of continuing numbness in his right leg, he visited a neurologist at our university and was referred to us for removal of the spinal tumor on April 25, 1990. Neurological examination on admission revealed mild weakness of his right leg and exaggerated right knee jerk. Though he complained of numbness in his right leg, no sensory disturbance was demonstrated objectively. His bladder-bowel function was normal. There were no caf\u00e9 au lait spots or subcutaneous neurofibromas. He and his mother were positive for anti-HTLV-1 (human T-lymphotrophic virus type 1) antibody. On May 1, laminectomy was performed at Th-7 to Th-9, and a yellowish brown tumor was found occupying the right posterolateral portion of the cord and extending to the surface. The dorsal root of Th-9, which was involved in the tumor, was cut and the tumor was subtotally removed. Histological examination showed interlacing bundles of spindle cells and loose areolar region. Immunohistochemically, the tumor was positive for S-100 protein and negative for GFAP. From these findings, the tumor was diagnosed as neurinoma. The postoperative course was uneventful, numbness disappeared, and the patient was discharged without neurological deficits.",
