Document 1 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): The impact of age on risk was present across all operations but had most impact in liver and rectal surgery. Surgeons are challenged to decide whether major sur-gery is justified in older adult patients, especially those with limited life expectancy. Effectiveness of oncologic surgery in older adult patients depends on whether a cure can be achieved safely without compromise to functional status or quality of life. Postoperative life expectancy should be improved by surgery, or, at the very least, not diminished.Emergency SurgeryEmergent surgery caries exceptionally high risk for older adult patients. In an analysis of patients age 90 years and older, 90-day mortality after emergency gastrointestinal procedures was 54%.71 In a large cohort of patients undergoing endovas-cular repair for ruptured aortic aneurysm, 30-day mortality was 35% after primary aortic repair and 52% after open conversion of endovascular aortic repair.72Frail institutionalized elders are at substantial risk for
Document 2 (Title: Clinical features and outcome in 68 cases of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage without aneurysm repair--a community hospital study.): The authors studied the clinical features and outcome at 6 months in 191 patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) from ruptured aneurysms. Aneurysm repair (AR) was undertaken in 123 cases (64.4%). In the non-AR group (n = 68), 48.5% of the patients were 70 years of age or older, compared with 12.2% in the AR group. The duration from onset to admission was less than 3 hours in 48 non-AR cases (70.6%) and in 42 AR cases (34.1%). Among non-AR patients, 63.2% were Hunt and Hess grade IV or V, whereas the figure for AR patients was only 14.7%. By 6 months after SAH, 94.1% of non-AR patients had died, and the remainder were vegetative or severely disabled. In contrast, only 15.4% in the AR group died, and over 50% showed good recovery. The large majority of non-AR patients were treated conservatively because they were judged to be poor surgical risks and, among these patients, nearly one half were elderly. In the 10 elderly patients considered good surgical candidates, vasospasm was the most common reason (70%) for not performing AR.
Document 3 (Title: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm -- Prognosis): Once an abdominal aortic aneurysm ruptures, the prognosis is grim. More than 50% of patients succumb before they reach the emergency room, and those who do survive have very high morbidity. Predictors of mortality include preoperative cardiac arrest, age older than 80, female sex, massive blood loss, and ongoing transfusion. [28] In a patient with a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm, the one factor determining mortality is the ability to achieve proximal control. For those undergoing elective repair, the prognosis is good to excellent. However, long-term survival depends on other comorbidities such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart disease, and peripheral vascular disease. An estimated 70% of patients survive for 5 years after repair.
Document 4 (Title: Intracranial aneurysm): Subarachnoid bleed If an aneurysm ruptures, blood leaks into the space around the brain. This is called a subarachnoid hemorrhage. Onset is usually sudden without prodrome, classically presenting as a "thunderclap headache" worse than previous headaches. Symptoms of a subarachnoid hemorrhage differ depending on the site and size of the aneurysm. Symptoms of a ruptured aneurysm can include: a sudden severe headache that can last from several hours to days nausea and vomiting drowsiness, confusion and/or loss of consciousness visual abnormalities meningism dizziness Almost all aneurysms rupture at their apex. This leads to hemorrhage in the subarachnoid space and sometimes in brain parenchyma. Minor leakage from aneurysm may precede rupture, causing warning headaches. About 60% of patients die immediately after rupture. Larger aneurysms have a greater tendency to rupture, though most ruptured aneurysms are less than 10 mm in diameter.
Document 5 (Title: [Ruptured cerebral aneurysm associated with coarctation of the aorta].): We present a 33-year-old female who had a ruptured aneurysm at the trifurcation of the right middle cerebral artery accompanied by coarctation of the aorta. The aneurysm was successfully clipped 15 hours after the attack of subarachnoid hemorrhage and approximately 3 months later the coarctation was surgically treated. Many authors reported that the incidence of cerebral aneurysm was higher in the patients with coarctation than the general population. Our review of the literatures, however, revealed that the incidence of cerebral aneurysm was the same in the population with or without coarctation. The incidence of rupture was higher when the aneurysms was accompanied by coarctation. The average age of the patients at the aneurysmal rupture was younger in the patients with coarctation than the patients without coarctation. These findings suggested that the growth and rupture of aneurysm in the patient with coarctation are related to the hypertension and atherosclerosis. Treatment of the patients with intracranial ruptured aneurysm accompanied by coarctation should begin with the clipping of the aneurysm, and then the coarctation surgically repaired. If the aneurysm is unruptured coarctation should be repaired first, and then the aneurysm clipped.
Document 6 (Title: Subarachnoid hemorrhage): An aneurysm may be detected incidentally on brain imaging; this presents a conundrum, as all treatments for cerebral aneurysms are associated with potential complications. The International Study of Unruptured Intracranial Aneurysms (ISUIA) provided prognostic data both in people having previously had a subarachnoid hemorrhage and people who had aneurysms detected by other means. Those having previously had a SAH were more likely to bleed from other aneurysms. In contrast, those having never bled and had small aneurysms (smaller than 10 mm) were very unlikely to have a SAH and were likely to sustain harm from attempts to repair these aneurysms. On the basis of the ISUIA and other studies, it is now recommended that people are considered for preventive treatment only if they have a reasonable life expectancy and have aneurysms that are highly likely to rupture. Moreover, there is only limited evidence that endovascular treatment of unruptured aneurysms is actually beneficial.
Document 7 (Title: Subarachnoid Hemorrhage -- Epidemiology): Most aSAH occur between 40 and 60 years of age, and young children and older adults can be affected. [22] The mean age of aneurysmal rupture ranges from 50-55 years. [23] It is more prevalent in the Blacks and Hispanic populations than the white Americans. [22] There is a slightly higher incidence of aneurysmal SAH in females, which may be related to their hormonal status. [23] Patients with a history of smoking and previously ruptured intracerebral aneurysm are highly associated with new subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Document 8 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): this technique was reserved for individuals with high surgical risk. A systematic review of transcatheter aortic valve implantation versus surgical aortic valve replacement revealed that, compared to surgical repair, the transcatheter approach may have similar or better early and midterm outcomes, including among lowto intermediate-risk patients.80 Furthermore, there is increasing evidence that suggests TAVI results in acceptable long-term results in the older adult population.81,82Endovascular Aortic SurgeryWith increasing use of screening abdominal CT scans and ultrasounds for evaluation of various abdominal complaints, abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) are being identified with greater frequency, The percentage of AAA rises from about 1% at age 55 to 60 years to approximately 10% in patients 80 years of age or older.83 Historically, very old patients were deemed poor operative candidates for the traditional open repair given the frequent presence of comorbid conditions and limited
Document 9 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): 80 years of age or older.83 Historically, very old patients were deemed poor operative candidates for the traditional open repair given the frequent presence of comorbid conditions and limited car-diopulmonary reserve to tolerate a major operation or the many hours of required operative time and general anesthesia. The dissemination of endovascular techniques for repair of AAA, however, has shifted the risk-benefit ratio for operative inter-vention, allowing greater life expectancy for the elective repair of this potentially life-threatening condition with the benefits of a minimally invasive approach.Multiple studies have demonstrated that endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) is feasible and efficacious in older adult patients, including those previously considered unfit for open repair. EVAR is a minimally invasive technique in which a pros-thetic graft is introduced into the aortic lumen via the common femoral artery to exclude the aortic aneurysm sac. EVAR sig-nificantly reduces
Document 10 (Title: Abdominal Aortic Repair -- Introduction): An abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is defined as a permanent dilation of the abdominal aorta, with a diameter greater than 3 cm or a diameter greater than 50% of the aortic diameter at the level of the diaphragm. If left untreated, progressive vessel wall degeneration leads to dilation and thinning of the vessel. Eventually, these changes can result in the rupture of the AAA. AAA prevalence and incidence rates have decreased over the last 20 years, both in developed and in developing countries. This decrease has been attributed partially to the decline in smoking. Prevalence is negligible before the age of 55 to 60 years, and after that, the prevalence increases with age. AAA prevalence is up to fourfold more in men (between 1.3% and 12.5%) than women (between 0.0% and 5.2%). [1] The risk of rupture increases with the size of the aneurysm: the 5-year risk for aneurysms less than 5 cm is 1% to 2%, whereas it is 20% to 40% for aneurysms greater than 5 cm in diameter. Abdominal aortic aneurysm represents about 1% of deaths in males over the age of 65 and is the tenth leading cause of death in men 65 years of age or older. The mortality rate of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm is over 80%. [2] Early diagnosis and treatment, therefore, is very important before its rupture.
Document 11 (Title: Neurology_Adams): It should be mentioned again that subarachnoid blood of some degree is very common after all degrees of head injury. A problem that sometimes arises in cases that display both contusions and subarachnoid blood is the possibility that a ruptured aneurysm was the initial event and that a resultant fall caused the contusions. In cases where the subarachnoid blood is concentrated around one of the major vessels of the circle of Willis, an angiogram is justified to exclude the latter possibility. Also in elderly patients, it has been difficult to determine whether a fall had been the cause or the result of a subarachnoid or an intracerebral hemorrhage. These subjects are addressed further in Chap. 33.
Document 12 (Title: Coarctation of the Aorta -- Complications): Aneurysm formation: Aneurysms at the repair site are serious long-term complications, particularly in patients undergoing patch repair or the subclavian flap technique. These aneurysms may be true aneurysms or pseudoaneurysms and can pose a risk of rupture, leading to life-threatening hemorrhage. Aneurysms or pseudoaneurysms can develop at sites of previous surgical repair or transcatheter intervention. [26] The incidence of aneurysm formation is higher with older repair techniques and less commonly observed with contemporary surgical approaches. However, vigilant long-term surveillance with cardiac MRI is recommended, often every 5 years, to detect these aneurysms early.
Document 13 (Title: Intracranial aneurysm): Vasospasm Vasospasm, referring to blood vessel constriction, can occur secondary to subarachnoid hemorrhage following a ruptured aneurysm. This is most likely to occur within 21 days and is seen radiologically within 60% of such patients. The vasospasm is thought to be secondary to the apoptosis of inflammatory cells such as macrophages and neutrophils that become trapped in the subarachnoid space. These cells initially invade the subarachnoid space from the circulation in order to phagocytose the hemorrhaged red blood cells. Following apoptosis, it is thought there is a massive degranulation of vasoconstrictors, including endothelins and free radicals, that cause the vasospasm. Risk factors Intracranial aneurysms may result from diseases acquired during life, or from genetic conditions. Hypertension, smoking, alcoholism, and obesity are associated with the development of brain aneurysms. Cocaine use has also been associated with the development of intracranial aneurysms.
Document 14 (Title: Popliteal Artery Aneurysm -- Treatment / Management -- Intra-Arterial Thrombolytic Therapy): This method is indicated when angiography demonstrates no target vessel or multiple distal thrombi are noted. The decision analysis suggested that open repair with great saphenous vein (GSV) bypass might be considered the preferred treatment for older, asymptomatic patients with popliteal artery aneurysms. The incidence of popliteal artery aneurysms in the general population is low, ranging from 0.1% to 2.8%. According to the rarity, screening unselected patients or patients undergoing abdominal aorta aneurysm is not cost-effective. However, patients with a known popliteal artery aneurysm have a significantly higher risk of having a contralateral popliteal artery aneurysm or an abdominal aortic aneurysm. The literature review suggests that younger age, the availability of a single-segment GSV, complicated runoff vessels, and lower surgical risk favor the option of open surgical repair. However, with advancing age and insufficient GSV, satisfactory landing zones, tibial runoff, and higher surgical risk might favor the endovascular options.
Document 15 (Title: Endovascular aneurysm repair): Patients with aneurysms require elective repair of their aneurysm when it reaches a diameter large enough (typically greater than 5.5 cm) such that the risk of rupture is greater than the risk of surgery. Repair is also warranted for aneurysms that rapidly enlarge or those that have been the source of emboli (debris from the aneurysm that dislodges and travel into other arteries). Lastly, the repair is also indicated for aneurysms that are the source of pain and tenderness, which may indicate impending rupture. The options for repair include traditional open aortic surgery or endovascular repair. Endovascular procedures aim to reduce the morbidity and mortality of treating arterial disease in a patient population that is increasingly older and less fit than when major open repairs were developed and popularized. Even in the early days, significant risks were accepted in the understanding that the large open operation was the only option. That is not the case in most patients today.
