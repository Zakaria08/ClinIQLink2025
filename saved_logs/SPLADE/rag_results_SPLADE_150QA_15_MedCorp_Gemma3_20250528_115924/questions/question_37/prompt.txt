Document 1 (Title: Expansion of a suppressor T-cell population associated with the hyper-IgM syndrome and generalized lymphadenopathy.): Immunoglobulin deficiency with increased IgM (hyper-IgM recurrent infection syndrome) is thought to be due to a defect of IgM/IgG isotype switching in B cells. Considerable genetic heterogeneity (X-linked, autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive inheritance, acquired forms) exists. We describe a case of hyper-IgM syndrome associated with massive lymphadenopathy in a 10-year-old girl with normal B-cell function. Absolute and relative increases of T-suppressor cells (CD8+) and a decrease of circulating CD4+ ("helper") cells were observed. The CD4+ cells present were all of the CD45R+ subtype, representing relatively immature ("naive") helper cells. In contrast, the number of CD4+ cells within the lymph nodes was increased. When tested fractionally, the patient's CD8+ cells selectively inhibited synthesis of IgG and IgA by normal B cells, but spared IgM. Normal allogenic T cells could induce IgG and IgA production by the patient's B cells. These findings suggest (a) a state of selective suppression of IgG and IgA synthesis with exclusive production of IgM, and (b) an abnormal recirculation of immature T-helper cells. This case represents a variant of this heterogeneous syndrome resembling the findings in neonatal lymphocytes and can be distinguished from the "adult" form of hyper-IgM syndrome which may be due to defective switch T cells.
Document 2 (Title: X-Linked Agammaglobulinemia -- Evaluation): A typical diagnostic test sequence would evaluate serum levels of IgG, IgM, and IgA, the number of CD19-positive or CD20-positive B cells in circulation, humoral vaccine responses, BTK protein expression in peripheral monocytes, and Btk gene sequencing. Test results consistent with a diagnosis of XLA in a male patient with a history of recurrent bacterial infections would include finding: Serum levels of IgG, IgM, and IgA that are more than two standard deviations below age-matched controls Absence of mature B lymphocytes in the peripheral circulation (i.e., fewer than 1-2%) Little or no increase in antibody titers 3-4 weeks after protein- or polysaccharide antigen vaccines (e.g., immunizing against pneumococcal pneumonia or diphtheria-tetanus) Low or absent BTK protein or mRNA expression levels Detection of disease-causing mutations in the Btk gene
Document 3 (Title: Hyper-IgM syndrome type 1): Fever (recurrent infections) Low counts of IgA, IgG and IgE antibodies CD40L not reactive in T cells Recurrent sinopulmonary and GI infections with pyogenic bacteria and opportunistic organisms, and cutaneous manifestations including pyodermas extensive warts. Pathogenesis This variant of the hyper IgM syndrome is caused by mutation of the CD40LG gene. The genetic locus for this gene is Xq26. This gene codes for the CD40 ligand, which is expressed on T cells. When the CD40 ligand binds CD40 on B cells, then the B cell switches from producing IgM to producing IgA or IgG. In these patients a biopsy of a lymph node may show poor development of structural and germinal centers because of the lack of activation of B cells by the T cells in them. Diagnosis Treatment
Document 4 (Title: Pemphigoid): DIF of bullous pemphigoid will show the presence of fine, continuous and linear deposits of IgG and/or C3 along the epidermal basement membrane. Other classes of immunoglobulins such as IgM and IgA are present in approximately 20% of cases and usually are less intense. In some cases with the deposits of IgA, patient may have oral lesion. At early stages of the disease, only C3 may be present. Indirect immunofluorescence Indirect immunofluorescence is used to detect circulating antibodies targeting the antigens at the basement membrane zone in patients with pemphigoid. In this procedure, patient's serum is collected and overlaid on salt-split normal human skin and incubated. Following this, the specimen will be stained for fluorescent detection of antibodies. In bullous pemphigoid, circulating IgG targeting the basement membrane, mainly BP180 and BP230 hemidesmosomal proteins are detectable in 60-80% of patients. IgA and IgE classes can also be detected, but less frequently.
Document 5 (Title: Pathology_Robbins): Despite impressive advances in our understanding and treatment of HIV infection, the long-term prognosis of patients with AIDS remains a concern. Although with effective drug therapy the mortality rate has declined in the United States, the treated patients still carry viral DNA in their lymphoid tissues. Truly curative therapy remains elusive. Similarly, although considerable effort has been mounted to develop a protective vaccine, many hurdles remain before this becomes a reality. Molecular analyses have revealed an alarming degree of variation in viral isolates from patients; this renders the task of producing a vaccine extremely difficult. Recent efforts have focused on producing broadly neutralizing antibodies against relatively invariant portions of HIV proteins. At present, therefore, prevention, public health measures, and anti-retroviral drugs remain the mainstays in the fight against AIDS. Progression of disease. HIVinfectionprogressesthroughphases.
Document 6 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Humoral and secretory immunity in the gastrointestinal tract is important for the control of enterovirus infections. Enteroviruses induce specific IgM, which usually persists for <6 months, and specific IgG, which persists for life. Capsid protein VP1 is the predominant target of neutralizing antibody, which generally confers lifelong protection against subsequent disease caused by the same serotype but does not prevent infection or virus shedding. Enteroviruses also induce cellular immunity whose significance is uncertain. Patients with impaired cellular immunity are not known to develop unusually severe disease when infected with enteroviruses. In contrast, the severe infections in patients with agammaglobulinemia emphasize the importance of humoral immunity in controlling enterovirus infections. Disseminated enterovirus infections have occurred in hematopoietic cell transplant recipients. IgA antibodies are instrumental in reducing poliovirus replication in and shedding from the
Document 7 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP), once the hallmark of AIDS, has dramatically declined in incidence following the development of effective prophylactic regimens and the widespread use of cART. It is, however, still the single most common cause of pneumonia in patients with HIV infection in the United States and can be identified as a likely etiologic agent in 25% of cases of pneumonia in patients with HIV infection, with an incidence in the range of 2–3 cases per 100 person-years. Approximately 50% of cases of HIV-associated PCP occur in patients who are unaware of their HIV status. The risk of PCP is greatest among those who have experienced a previous bout of PCP and those who have CD4+ T cell counts of <200/μL. Overall, 79% of patients with PCP have CD4+ T cell counts <100/μL and 95% of patients have CD4+ T cell counts <200/μL. Recurrent fever, night sweats, thrush, and unexplained weight loss also are associated with an increased incidence of PCP. For these reasons, it is strongly
Document 8 (Title: Selective IgA Deficiency -- Introduction): Immunoglobulin A (IgA) deficiency is the most common primary immunodeficiency characterized by a decreased amount of serum IgA and a concomitant lack of secretory IgA. Other immunoglobulin levels are normal. By the International Consensus definition, the diagnosis is established in individuals older than four years whose blood levels of IgA are below 7 mg/dl but have normal levels of IgG and IgM. (IgE is  normal too.) These individuals have a normal antibody response to vaccines. Nevertheless, IgA deficiency should be excluded from other causes of hypogammaglobulinemia and defects in T lymphocytes. Patients who suffer from selective IgA deficiency may have clinical symptoms, but most are largely asymptomatic. [1] [2] IgA deficiency is often associated with normal CD4 and CD8 T cells, with normal B lymphocytes in the systemic circulation. Some patients, though,  may harbor anti-IgA autoantibodies.
Document 9 (Title: [A case of recurrent Epstein-Barr virus meningitis].): A 17-year-old male was admitted to our hospital complaining of fever, headache and nausea. On physical examinations cervical and inguinal lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly were noted. Neurological examination revealed meningeal signs. Blood examination showed slightly increased lymphocytes and atypical lymphocytes (1-4%), increased ESR, CRP (2+), slightly elevated EBV VCA IgG (X20), and normal EBV VCA IgM (less than X 10). Initial pressure of CSF was 195mmH2O, cells 46/3mm3, protein 50mg/dl. Slowing of back ground activity of EEG such as theta and delta wave was noted. CT scan revealed normal. During the course EBV VCA IgG elevated to X160, EBV VCA IgM elevated to X20. Slight respiratory disturbance, photophobia, and dysosmia were noted. One month later, clinical symptoms and laboratory data improved, the patient was discharged. Forty days after the discharge, headache was excerbated and increased CSF protein (100mg/dl) and pleocytosis (33/3mm3) were noted. The patient was readmitted to the hospital. After 2 weeks in the hospital, symptoms were diminished and laboratory findings revealed normal. During 2 years before the third admission he was asymptomatic and could enjoy the college life. At age 19, he was admitted to our hospital complaining of fever, headache and nausea. Neurologically slight meningeal irritation was noted. Blood examination revealed 1% atypical lymphocytes. EBV VCA IgG was elevated (X320) and EBNA was X80. CSF protein was slightly increased (52mg/dl). During the clinical course CSF protein was elevated to 105mg/dl and cell count to 502/3mm3 (N: L = 27: 409, with 66 atypical lymphocytes). Persistent hiccup was noted. After 50 days CSF findings were improved and he was discharged.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Document 10 (Title: HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder): HAD typically occurs after years of HIV infection and is associated with low CD4+ T cell levels and high plasma viral loads. It is sometimes seen as the first sign of the onset of AIDS. Prevalence is between 10–24% in Western countries and has only been seen in 1–2% of India-based infections. With the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), the incidence of HAD has declined in developed countries, although its prevalence is increasing. HAART may prevent or delay the onset of HAD in people with HIV infection, and may also improve mental function in people who already have HAD. Dementia only exists when neurocognitive impairment in the patient is severe enough to interfere markedly with day-to-day function. That is, the patient is typically unable to work and may not be able to take care of him or herself. Before this, the patient is said to have a mild neurocognitive disorder.
Document 11 (Title: [A case report of spotted fever group rickettsiosis first encountered in Shimane Prefecture, Japan].): Rickettsial infections of a spotted fever group have recently been experience in Japan. Although there have been 50 cases reported by this time, they were exclusively distributed in the areas along the Pacific coast. We report in this paper the first case of spotted fever group rickettsiosis in Shimane prefecture, an area faced to the Japan Sea. A 57 year-old man with high fever, general fatigue and rash was admitted to the hospital of Shimane Medical University at the end of September 1987, who had been treated with cefaclor for a few days without effect before his visit to the University Hospital. Physical examination revealed erythematous eruption, eschar on the left side of the abdomen, and generalized lymphadenopathy. Hepatosplenomegaly was not detected. Laboratory studies showed normal leukocyte counts with relative lymphopenia, high ESR and increased CRP. Transaminase levels were slightly elevated. Paul-Bunnel and Weil-Felix tests resulted in negative. Specific immunofluorescence tests demonstrated that IgG and IgM antibodies of acute-phase serum to Rickettsia japonica, a spotted fever group rickettsia isolated from patients in Japan, were not detected, while both IgG and IgM antibody titers of convalescent-phase serum increased to 1:320. Convalescent-phase serum reacted at significantly lower titers with R.typhi as well as other pathogenic spotted fever group rickettsiae. The patient was treated with ofloxacin for six days and then with combination of ofloxacin and minocycline. It should be noted that clinical symptoms such as high fever and general fatigue disappeared during a single therapy with ofloxacin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Document 12 (Title: Prevention of Opportunistic Infections in HIV/AIDS -- Introduction): There is a progressive decrease in CD4+ counts in HIV/AIDS when left untreated. CD4+ cells play an important role in mounting an immune response against infections. These cells release cytokines that lead to the activation of antigen-presenting cells, phagocytic cells, natural killer cells, and cytotoxic T cells.  They also support the conversion of B-lymphocytes into long-lived plasma cells and memory B cells. A decrease in CD4+ T cell count thus leads to a decline in both humoral and cell-mediated immunity. Ultimately it predisposes patients to a higher risk of contracting opportunistic diseases due to viruses, bacteria, fungi, and protozoa. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] As the dogma of medicine is "Prevention is better than cure", preventing opportunistic infections in HIV/AIDS patients is paramount to seeing a decrease in both disease burden and associated mortality. In this review article, we discuss the methods of preventing opportunistic infections in HIV/AIDS patients.
Document 13 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): marker of disease progression. In patients with CD4+ T cell counts >200/ μL, the differential diagnosis of lymphadenopathy includes KS, TB, Castleman’s disease, and lymphoma. In patients with more advanced disease, lymphadenopathy may also be due to atypical mycobacterial infection, toxoplasmosis, systemic fungal infection, or bacillary angiomatosis. While indicated in patients with CD4+ T cell counts <200/μL, lymph node biopsy is not indicated in patients with early-stage disease unless there are signs and symptoms of systemic illness, such as fever and weight loss, or unless the nodes begin to enlarge, become fixed, or coalesce. Monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS) (Chap. 136), defined as the presence of a serum monoclonal IgG, IgA, or IgM in the absence of a clear cause, has been reported in 3% of patients with HIV infection. The overall clinical significance of this finding in patients with HIV infection is unclear, although it has been associated with other viral
Document 14 (Title: Ataxia-Telangiectasia -- History and Physical): A-T patients have immunological abnormalities, including immunoglobulin, antibody deficiencies, and lymphopenia, commonly affecting about two-thirds of cases. Usually, patients present with low IgA and IgG levels, variable IgM, and low total CD4 cell count. [32] [9] Moreover, individuals with A-T also have an increased predisposition for cancers, especially those of lymphoid origin. Pulmonary disease and problems with feeding, swallowing, and nutrition are typical, and there may also be dermatological and endocrine manifestations. [9] Frequent infections, especially severe sino-pulmonary infections, may indicate immunodeficiency in addition to autoimmune and chronic inflammatory diseases. [33] A-T patients are prone to symptomatic viral infections, especially in the setting of lower IgA and higher IgM titers, plus higher CD8+ counts. [34] Autoimmune deficiency generally does not progress.
Document 15 (Title: Immunology_Janeway): 12.6 Short Answer: Large amounts of IgA are produced by intestinal B cells and plasma cells and secreted into the lumen as a means to keep the microbiota in check and prevent invasion from pathogens, yet most individuals with IgA deficiency are not overly susceptible to infections.
