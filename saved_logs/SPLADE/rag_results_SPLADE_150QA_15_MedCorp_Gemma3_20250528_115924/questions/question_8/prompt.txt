Document 1 (Title: First_Aid_Step1): Abdominal structures enter the thorax A ; may occur due to congenital defect of pleuroperitoneal membrane or from trauma. Commonly occurs on left side due to relative protection of right hemidiaphragm by liver. Most commonly a hiatal hernia, in which stomach herniates upward through the esophageal hiatus of the diaphragm. Sliding hiatal hernia—gastroesophageal junction is displaced upward as gastric cardia slides into hiatus; “hourglass stomach.” Most gastric fundus common type. Associated with GERD. Paraesophageal hiatal hernia— gastroesophageal junction is usually normal but gastric fundus protrudes into the thorax. Goes through the internal (deep) inguinal ring, external (superficial) inguinal ring, and into the groin. Enters internal inguinal ring lateral to inferior epigastric vessels. Caused by failure of processus vaginalis to close (can form hydrocele). May be noticed in infants or discovered in adulthood. Much more common in males B .
Document 2 (Title: Gastroschisis -- Treatment / Management -- Delivery): Infants with gastroschisis have no contraindication to vaginal delivery based on gastroschisis alone. The timing of delivery is based on gestation age (lung maturity), ultrasound findings (fetal growth profile, bowel appearance), and fetal testing results. Care for the infant is usually managed by a group of specialists, including a maternal-fetal medicine specialist, neonatologist, and pediatric surgery, to discuss patient-specific factors before delivery. The mean gestational age for spontaneous delivery in women carrying infants with gastroschisis is the 36th week of gestation. [17] [18] A survey of practice patterns demonstrated forty percent of maternal-fetal medicine specialists deliver infants at 37 weeks, 30 percent deliver at 39 weeks if gastroschisis is stable. The remainder delivers infants before 37 weeks. [13] Overall, many maternal-medicine specialists allow a trial of vaginal delivery. When there is marked liver herniation, a cesarean section should be considered. One factor that some specialists utilize to determine continued gestation is if the bowel does not dilate greater than 25 mm after 37 weeks gestation.
Document 3 (Title: Pyloric stenosis): Cause Rarely, infantile pyloric stenosis can occur as an autosomal dominant condition. It is uncertain whether it is a congenital anatomic narrowing or a functional hypertrophy of the pyloric sphincter muscle. Pathophysiology The gastric outlet obstruction due to the hypertrophic pylorus impairs emptying of gastric contents into the duodenum. As a consequence, all ingested food and gastric secretions can only exit via vomiting, which can be of a projectile nature. While the exact cause of the hypertrophy remains unknown, one study suggested that neonatal hyperacidity may be involved in the pathogenesis. This physiological explanation for the development of clinical pyloric stenosis at around 4 weeks and its spontaneous long term cure without surgery if treated conservatively, has recently been further reviewed.
Document 4 (Title: Gastroschisis -- Introduction): Gastroschisis is a paraumbilical, full-thickness abdominal wall defect associated with protrusion of the bowel through the defect. It is rarely associated with genetic conditions. A membrane does not cover the bowel exposed in utero and, as a result, may be matted, dilated, and covered with a fibrinous inflammatory rind. Infants have a high proportion of intrauterine growth restriction. Diagnosis is often made on the 20-week ultrasound with free-floating bowel loops in the uterine cavity. Maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is elevated in pregnancies with gastroschisis. Compared with other abdominal wall defects diagnosed prenatally, such as omphalocele, only 10 percent of cases with gastroschisis are associated with malformations outside of the gastrointestinal tract. Additional gastrointestinal problems occur in up to a quarter of cases. Infants can be classified and simple or complex, which can help stratify outcomes and care for infants born with gastroschisis. Complexity is based on the absence or presence of intestinal atresia, stenosis, bowel perforation, necrosis, malrotation, or volvulus. Infants may benefit from delivery in a facility with resources such as high-risk obstetrics, neonatology, and neonatal intensive care unit, and a pediatric surgeon—a trial of labor rather than scheduled cesarean birth for most patients. Spontaneous delivery usually occurs between 37 to 38 weeks gestation. A trial of spontaneous vaginal delivery is supported. The exposed infant bowel is protected following birth, an orogastric tube is placed, as are peripheral IVs. The airway is stabilized. Gastroschisis closure can be performed operatively or through slow bowel reductions utilizing a spring-loaded silo to contain the bowel. While a small percentage of infants have intestinal atresia, bowel loss, and prolonged hospitalizations, the overall survival is greater than 90%. [1]
Document 5 (Title: [Spontaneous vaginal delivery in a case of total placenta previa (author's transl)].): In a 26 year old gravida 2, Para O, Aborta 1, a total placenta previa was diagnosed at 30 weeks gestation in an ultrasound tomogram. A repeat ultrasound examination 9 weeks later showed no more placenta previa in front of the cervix. This was at first interpreted as a change in the site of the placenta during the pregnancy. During the spontaneous labour the contractions, fetal heart rate and the intermittent scalp pH were monitored. A spontaneous vertex presentation delivery of a normal infant through the placenta resulted. Microscopic examination of the placenta showed a central defect with wide marginal infarcts probably due to compression atrophy by the presenting part.
Document 6 (Title: Sacrococcygeal teratoma): Management of fetal SCTs Management of most fetal SCTs involves watchful waiting prior to any treatment. An often used decision tree is as follows: Perform detailed ultrasound exam including fetal echocardiogram and Doppler flow analysis If fetal high output failure, placentomegaly, or hydrops If fetus not mature, perform pregnancy termination or fetal intervention Else fetus mature, perform emergency Cesarean section Else no emergent problems, perform serial non-stress tests and ultrasound biophysical profiles and plan delivery, as follows If emergent problems develop, return to top of decision tree Else if SCT over 5–10 cm or polyhydramnios, perform early (37 weeks gestation) elective Cesarean section Else SCT small and no complications, permit term spontaneous vaginal delivery
Document 7 (Title: First_Aid_Step1): Intestinal atresia Presents with bilious vomiting and abdominal distension within first 1–2 days of life. Duodenal atresia—failure to recanalize. Abdominal x-ray A shows “double bubble” (dilated stomach, proximal duodenum). Associated with Down syndrome. Jejunal and ileal atresia—disruption of mesenteric vessels (typically SMA)  ischemic necrosis of fetal intestine  segmental resorption: bowel becomes discontinuous. X-ray shows dilated loops of small bowel with air-fluid levels. Most common cause of gastric outlet obstruction in infants (1:600). Palpable olive-shaped mass in epigastric region, visible peristaltic waves, and nonbilious projectile vomiting at ∼ 2–6 weeks old. More common in firstborn males; associated with exposure to macrolides. Results in hypokalemic hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis (2° to vomiting of gastric acid and subsequent volume contraction). Ultrasound shows thickened and lengthened pylorus A .
Document 8 (Title: Pregnancy after Fontan repair of tricuspid atresia.): We have described a patient who had a cyanotic congenital heart disease (type Ib tricuspid atresia), with initial palliation accomplished in childhood via a Glenn procedure. In 1985, she had a Fontan repair with the Bjork modification; 3 years later she achieved her first pregnancy at age 27. Maternal Doppler echocardiography in early pregnancy showed good flow through the constructed conduit, with normal left ventricular size and function. Fetal echocardiography at 22 weeks' gestation via two-dimensional, M-mode, pulsed Doppler, and color flow mapping revealed no evidence of fetal cardiac disease. At 25 weeks' gestation recalcitrant preterm labor developed, and the infant was delivered spontaneously. Labor, delivery, and puerperium were uncomplicated, and the newborn (though too premature to survive) was of appropriate weight for gestational age, without evidence of congenital heart disease or other anomalies. We believe this is the first report of pregnancy and spontaneous delivery in a patient who has had Fontan repair of a congenital heart defect.
Document 9 (Title: Conjoined twins: prenatal diagnosis and assessment of associated malformations.): Prenatal diagnosis of conjoined twins is difficult and was rarely accomplished prior to the advent of sonography. Early prenatal diagnosis and assessment for shared vital organs are desirable for optimal obstetrical counseling and management. The authors retrospectively reviewed prenatal findings in 14 cases of conjoined twins. Thoracoomphalopagus was the most common type of conjoining, occurring in five cases (36%). Prenatal sonography showed shared hearts in nine (64%) cases, indicating severe conjoining and negligible chance for postnatal correction. Two sets of omphalopagus conjoined twins had separate hearts; however, severe congenital heart disease was present. Early prenatal diagnosis and assessment of the degree of conjoining provided couples with the option for pregnancy termination via vaginal delivery. In this series, nine patients elected pregnancy termination prior to 24 weeks and delivered vaginally. Transvaginal ultrasound significantly improved the delineation of conjunction in two patients, and computed tomography permitted the diagnosis to be confirmed in two patients.
Document 10 (Title: Cesarean section does not improve outcome in gastroschisis.): Elective cesarean section (CS) following prenatal diagnosis of gastroschisis has been advocated to decrease morbidity and mortality. To examine this hypothesis, we reviewed the records of 28 consecutive patients with gastroschisis treated between 1975 and 1987. Fourteen infants were delivered vaginally (V) and fourteen by CS, of which seven were elective, five were for fetal distress, and two were for breech presentation. Prenatal diagnosis was made in nine infants in the CS group and none in the vaginal group. The two groups were comparable in gestational age (V = 37.6 weeks, CS = 35.8 weeks, P = .05), birth weight (V = 2,508 g, CS = 2,444 g, P = NS), and five-minute Apgar score (V = 7.8, CS = 6.8, P = NS). Outcome was similar as measured by hospital mortality (V = 0/14, CS = 1/14, P = NS), complications (V = 4/14, CS = 5/14, P = NS), days to enteral feeding (V = 14, CS = 19, P = NS), and days in the hospital (V = 27, CS = 34, P = NS). The only complication related to mode of delivery was preventable; an infant delivered vaginally had avulsion of a short segment of mesentery requiring bowel resection. Infants born by CS were slightly more likely to have primary closure (5/14) than babies delivered vaginally (3/14, P = NS), but this may reflect independent trends in the last 5 years. Elective CS following prenatal diagnosis in seven patients did not improve outcome; primary closure was achieved in only one infant, and three had a complication. Since these data show no significant difference in morbidity and mortality between vaginal and CS delivery, we suggest that CS should not be recommended simply because a prenatal diagnosis of gastroschisis is made.
Document 11 (Title: Pregnancy test): Ultrasound Obstetric ultrasonography may also be used to detect and diagnose pregnancy. It is very common to have a positive at home urine pregnancy test before an ultrasound. Both abdominal and vaginal ultrasound may be used, but vaginal ultrasound allows for earlier visualization of the pregnancy. With obstetric ultrasonography the gestational sac (intrauterine fluid collection) can be visualized at 4.5 to 5 weeks gestation, the yolk sac at 5 to 6 weeks gestation, and fetal pole at 5.5 to 6 weeks gestation. Ultrasound is used to diagnose multiple gestation. Accuracy A systematic review published in 1998 showed that home pregnancy test kits, when used by experienced technicians, are almost as accurate as professional laboratory testing (97.4%). When used by consumers, however, the accuracy fell to 75%: the review authors noted that many users misunderstood or failed to follow the instructions included in the kits.
Document 12 (Title: Pyloric stenosis): Most cases of pyloric stenosis are diagnosed/confirmed with ultrasound, if available, showing the thickened pylorus and non-passage of gastric contents into the proximal duodenum. Muscle wall thickness 3 millimeters (mm) or greater and pyloric channel length of 15 mm or greater are considered abnormal in infants younger than 30 days. Gastric contents should not be seen passing through the pylorus because if it does, pyloric stenosis should be excluded and other differential diagnoses such as pylorospasm should be considered. The positions of superior mesenteric artery and superior mesenteric vein should be noted because altered positions of these two vessels would be suggestive of intestinal malrotation instead of pyloric stenosis.
Document 13 (Title: Antenatal detection of renal abnormalities.): The aim of this retrospective study is to assess the value of routine ultrasonography in the detection of renal abnormalities. Twenty-nine pregnancies (one set of twins) with suspected renal abnormalities (i.e. renal cystic spaces, oligohydramnios or hyperechoic kidneys) were delivered over a two year period (1.8.1987-31-7-1989) in a unit where 90% of pregnancies (6,562) were scanned routinely at 18-20 weeks gestation or later, if booking for confinement was delayed. In pregnancies with suspected anomalies prenatal ultrasound was performed monthly until 28 weeks and fortnightly until delivery. Non survivors [5] had histological or postmortem examination. Liveborn infants [25] had renal ultrasonography in the neonatal period and paediatric follow-up if abnormal. Sixteen (53%) of the 30 cases (one set of twins) suspected of renal abnormalities by routine prenatal ultrasonography had renal anomalies confirmed postnatally. Five women were non survivors, all of which had associated anomalies. In the eleven survivors the diagnoses were pelvi-ureteric junction obstruction [6], renal dysplasia [2], vesicoureteric reflux [2] and suspected ureterocele [1]. Fourteen infants with pelvicalyceal dilatation had normal postnatal renal ultrasound. Although abnormal prenatal renal ultrasound is a useful indicator of postnatal disease and aids decisions on the management of pregnancy, further large collaborative studies with extended paediatric follow-up are required to assess the significance of pelvicalyceal dilatation.
Document 14 (Title: Obstetric ultrasonography): Influencing factors The accuracy of fetal sex discernment depends on: Gestational age Precision of sonographic machine Expertise of the operator Fetal posture Ultrasonography of the cervix Obstetric sonography is useful in the assessment of the cervix in women at risk for premature birth. A short cervix preterm is associated with a higher risk for premature delivery: At 24 weeks' gestation, a cervix length of less than 25 mm defines a risk group for spontaneous preterm birth. Further, the shorter the cervix, the greater the risk. Cervical measurement on ultrasound also has been helpful to use ultrasonography in patients with preterm contractions, as those whose cervical length exceeds 30 mm are unlikely to deliver within the next week. Abnormality screening
Document 15 (Title: Pregnancy Dating -- Clinical Significance): Establishing an accurate gestational age and estimated delivery date is the most important step in managing any pregnancy. [1] Accurate knowledge of gestational age allows laboratory and screening tests to be performed at the appropriate time in the pregnancy. [1] Optimal dating before 22 0/7 weeks enables an accurate assessment of fetal growth as the pregnancy progresses. Suboptimally dated pregnancies, due to the error of ultrasound at advanced gestational age, can be difficult to manage because of the uncertainty of pregnancy dating. Elective delivery should not be performed in suboptimally dated pregnancies. In pregnancies with clear medical indications for delivery (pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, etc), delivery planning should be based on the best clinical estimation of gestational age. Amniocentesis for fetal lung maturity should not be used routinely before planning delivery for sub-optimally dated pregnancy. Even with proven fetal lung maturity, late preterm and early-term infants have an increased risk of respiratory morbidity. Elective delivery should be performed at 41 completed weeks due to concerns that the fetus could be further along than estimated by third-trimester ultrasound. Antepartum fetal testing can be performed after 39 weeks in patients with sub-optimal dating due to concerns for post-term pregnancy. [3] In a sub-optimally dated pregnancy, a repeat low transverse cesarean delivery, if desired by the patient, should be performed at 39 weeks based on the best estimate of gestational age.
