Document 1 (Title: Henry Dalton): The operation occurred on September 6, 1891 at the City Hospital, on a twenty-two-year-old man who had been stabbed in the chest. Upon arrival of the patient, Dalton cleaned the wound and applied a dressing of antiseptic gauze. After several hours, the patient's condition worsened: the left side of his chest became dull to percussion; his temperature and pulse rate rose; his breathing became shallow; and he complained of considerable pain. He was taken to the surgical amphitheatre, where Dalton made an incision over the fourth rib and removed about of it. After tying the severed intercostal artery to control bleeding and removing the blood from the pleural cavity, Dalton observed a transverse wound of the pericardium about in length. With a sharply curved needle and catgut, he closed the wound by continuous suture, overcoming great difficulty caused by the heart pulsations. The pleural cavity was then irrigated and the chest incision closed without drainage. The patient made "an
Document 2 (Title: [Bronchiectasis treated with negative extra-thoracic pressure ventilation].): A 25-year old man with 5-year history of bronchiectasis was admitted to the ICU complaining of severe shortness of breath. He had a respiratory rate of 40 to 50 breath/min. On 0.5 l/min of oxygen with nasal cannula, arterial blood pH was 7.39, Paco2 52.3 mmHg, Pao2 45.0 mmHg. Then, on 1 l/min of oxygen, Pao2 was unchanged, but Paco2 increased to 58 mmHg. As his consciousness was so clear, we applied to him the negative extra-thoracic pressure ventilator which was designed by the authors. Negative extra-thoracic pressure ventilation (NETPV) was maintained at a IMV rate of 30 breath/min, peak negative extra-thoracic pressure of -20 to -30 cmH2O, and an inspiratory/expiratory ratio of 1:2. During NETPV, his respiratory rate and oxygen consumption were decreased and Pao2 was increased compared with his spontaneous breathing. He made a recovery from dyspnea, especially, he was able to take a deep breath. When NETPV was applied to him, pulmonary artery and arterial catheterizations revealed that central venous pressure was slightly decreased, cardiac index unchanged or slightly decreased, heart rate, systemic blood pressure, and pulmonary arterial pressure unchanged compared with spontaneous breathing. The patient was able to read books and maintained communication in his voice with his family and the medical staff. After 3 days of the treatment with NETPV, a marked improvement was noted and the patient was discharged from the ICU. NETPV has the benefits as follows. First, it is very easy for both a patient and a doctor to assist his breathing because an endotracheal intubation is not necessary.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Document 3 (Title: Anatomy_Gray): A 53-year-old man presented to the emergency department with a 5-hour history of sharp pleuritic chest pain and shortness of breath. The day before he was on a long haul flight, returning from his holidays. He was usually fit and well and was a keen mountain climber. He had no previous significant medical history. On physical examination his lungs were clear, he was tachypneic at 24/min, and his saturation was reduced to 92% on room air. Pulmonary embolism was suspected and the patient was referred for a CT pulmonary angiogram. The study demonstrated clots within the right and left main pulmonary arteries. There was no pleural effusion, lung collapse, or consolidation. He was immediately started on subcutaneous enoxaparin and converted to oral anticoagulation over the course of a couple of days. The whole treatment lasted 6 months as no other risk factors (except immobilization during a long haul flight) were identified. There were no permanent sequelae.
Document 4 (Title: Case Study: 32-Year-Old Male Presenting with Right Lower Quadrant Abdominal Pain (Archived) -- Case Presentation): The patient denies prior abdominal surgeries. He does smoke a half pack of cigarettes a day, drinks alcohol socially, and denies any recreational drug use. He notes no inherited medical conditions in his family. Vital signs on arrival: Blood pressure (BP) 120/73 Heart rate (HR) 60 RR 18 Temperature: 35.6 C Oxygen saturation: 98% on room air Height 5'10" (178 cm) Weight 154 lbs (70 kg)
Document 5 (Title: Naloxone -- Monitoring): For those whose respiratory depression is completely reversed with 0.4 to 2 mg of naloxone, observation in the emergency room for 2 to 4 hours is advised. If the patient is stable, discharge is recommended. In general, patients considered for discharge after reversal of the opioid overdose with naloxone should have: [27] A Glasgow coma scale of 15 No need for additional naloxone doses An oxygen saturation of at least 92% on room air A respiration rate of no less than 10 breaths/min A pulse rate of no less than 50 bpm or no more than 120 bpm A blood pressure between 110/90 and 140/90 mm Hg Tolerance for clear liquids, ambulation, and have no withdrawal symptoms Someone to drive home and monitor the patient for the next 12 to 24 hours
Document 6 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): A 45-year-old man is brought to the local hospital emer-gency department by ambulance. His wife reports that he had been in his normal state of health until 3 days ago when he developed a fever and a productive cough. Dur-ing the last 24 hours he has complained of a headache and is increasingly confused. His wife reports that his medical history is significant only for hypertension, for which he takes hydrochlorothiazide and lisinopril, and that he is allergic to amoxicillin. She says that he developed a rash many years ago when prescribed amoxicillin for bron-chitis. In the emergency department, the man is febrile (38.7°C [101.7°F]), hypotensive (90/54 mmHg), tachypneic (36/min), and tachycardic (110/min). He has no signs of meningismus but is oriented only to person. A stat chest x-ray shows a left lower lung consolidation consistent with pneumonia. A CT scan is not concerning for lesions or elevated intracranial pressure. The plan is to start empiric antibiotics and perform a
Document 7 (Title: [Postoperative, opiate-induced respiratory depression is not dependent on arousal].): Respiratory depression after intravenous anesthesia is supposed to be related to vigilance. This hypothesis could not yet be tested because of the lack of methods measuring continuously important parameters of respiration without altering the patient's vigilance. Pulse Oximetry offers this possibility. The following study was performed to investigate the effects of the Benzodiazepine Antagonist Flumazenil (Anexate) on parameters of vigilance and respiration after Midazolam/Fentanyl anesthesia. 40 healthy patients aged 18-65 years who were to undergo arthroscopy were randomly assigned to Flumazenil (Group F) or no Flumazenil = Control (Group C). All patients received 7.5-10 mg Midazolam, 0.3-0.6 Fentanyl, 4-6 mg Vecuronium, were intubated and ventilated with 8 ml/kg BW VT x 12/min - N2O/O2 = 2:1. At the end of operation Group F received 0.3-0.5 mg Flumazenil. When adequate spontaneous ventilation was restored the patients were extubated and brought to a single bed room where they were monitored and observed without being disturbed, except at the arrival time (T1), 15 min (T2) and 30 min (T3) when blood pressure was measured and the pain score was asked. The following parameters were registered: Transcutaneous Oxygen Saturation (SAT) and Heart Rate (HR) continuously, Sedation (every minute) and Reactions to acoustic or verbal stimuli in the case of hypoxemia. The two groups were compared with respect to the number and severity of hypoxic events/15 min, the mean degree of sedation (6 point scale) and the number of adequate reactions to the acoustic alarm resp. instruction: "Take a deep breath!" Wilcoxon Test, Chi-Square test (p less than or equal to 0.05) is significant). The groups were comparable with respect to their anthropometric data, dosages of Midazolam and Fentanyl, and perioperative blood pressures. Parameters of vigilance: Group F was less sedated than Group C (p = 0.052) and reacted better to the verbal instruction to take a deep breath in the case of hypoxia (p less than or equal to 0.05). Parameters of respiration: Hypoxic states occurred more frequently in group F (p = 0.098) and lasted longer. The severeness was significantly more pronounced in group F (p less than or equal to 0.05). There were no complications and the patients acceptance of the anesthetic procedure was high. The hypothesis that postoperative respiratory depression is related to the degree of vigilance cannot be accepted. In contrast there is a strong evidence that under special conditions patients can be in a relatively high degree of vigilance and do not breathe with subsequent severe hypoxemia. The possible u
Document 8 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): Helge Eilers, MD, & Spencer Yost, MD An elderly man with type 2 diabetes mellitus and ischemic pain in the lower extremity is scheduled for femoral-to-popliteal artery bypass surgery. He has a history of hyper-tension and coronary artery disease with symptoms of stable angina. He can walk only half a block before pain in his legs forces him to stop. He has a 50-pack-year smoking history but stopped 2 years ago. Medications include atenolol, atorvastatin, and hydrochlorothiazide. The nurse in the preoperative holding area obtains the following vital signs: temperature 36.8°C (98.2°F), blood pressure 168/100 mm Hg, heart rate 78 bpm, oxygen saturation by pulse oximeter 96% while breathing room air, and pain 5/10 in the right lower leg after walking into the hospital. What anesthetic agents will you choose for his anesthetic plan? Why? Does the choice of anesthetic make a difference?
Document 9 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): James L. Zehnder, MD and edema and is tender to touch. Oxygen saturation by fingertip pulse oximeter while breathing room air is 87% (normal > 90%). Ultrasound reveals a deep vein thrombosis in the left lower extremity; chest computed tomography scan confirms the presence of pulmonary emboli. Laboratory blood tests indicate elevated d-dimer levels. What therapy is indicated acutely? What are the long-term therapy options? How long should she be treated? Should this indi-vidual use oral contraceptives? A 25-year-old woman presents to the emergency depart-ment complaining of acute onset of shortness of breath and pleuritic pain. She had been in her usual state of health until 2 days prior when she noted that her left leg was swollen and red. Her only medication was oral contraceptives. Family history was significant for a history of “blood clots” in mul-tiple members of the maternal side of her family. Physical examination demonstrates an anxious woman with stable vital signs.

Document 10 (Title: Traumatic false aneurysm of the common carotid artery presenting as a mediastinal mass: a case report.): A 42-year-old man came to another institution with chest pain and a cough and was found to have a 15 cm mass on the left side of his chest. Carcinoma was suspected but not proved, and a course of chemotherapy was administered. Two years later he was referred to Duke University Medical Center after he experienced a thromboembolic event in his left upper extremity. A CT scan and angiogram of the chest showed a large false aneurysm located 5 cm from the origin of the left common carotid artery and filling the anterior mediastinum. Additional history was obtained of multiple stab wounds to the left side of the chest 7 years before admission. The aneurysm was treated with sequential saphenous vein bypass grafting of right common carotid to left common carotid to left subclavian artery, followed by aneurysm thrombosis induced with wire coils. The differential diagnosis of a chest mass should include aneurysms of the great vessels.
Document 11 (Title: ABC (medicine)): Chest deformity and movement - The chest should rise and fall equally on both sides, and should be free of deformity. Clinicians may be able to get a working diagnosis from abnormal movement or shape of the chest in cases such as pneumothorax or haemothorax Listening to external breath sounds a short distance from the patient can reveal dysfunction such as a rattling noise (indicative of secretions in the airway) or stridor (which indicates airway obstruction) Checking for surgical emphysema which is air in the subcutaneous layer which is suggestive of a pneumothorax Auscultation and percussion of the chest by using a stethoscope to listen for normal chest sounds or any abnormalities Pulse oximetry may be useful in assessing the amount of oxygen present in the blood, and by inference the effectiveness of the breathing
Document 12 (Title: Acute coronary syndrome): with pacemakers – especially the older models, since such devices developed in the last 30 years are bipolar and are generally not affected by the small electromagnetic fields generated by dental equipment. It is therefore important to know the type of pacemaker, the degree of electromagnetic protection of the generator, and the nature of the arrhythmia. If arrhythmia develops during dental treatment, the procedure should be suspended, oxygen is to be given, and the patient vital signs are to be assessed: body temperature (normal values: 35.5-37oC), pulse (normal values: 60-100 bpm), respiratory frequency (normal values in adults: 14-20 cycles or respirations per minute), blood pressure (normal values: systolic blood pressure under 140 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure under 90 mmHg). Sublingual nitrites are to be administered if there is chest pain. The patient should be placed in the Trendelenburg position, with vagal maneuvering where necessary (valsalva maneuver, massage in the
Document 13 (Title: Pulse oximetry): Pulse oximetry is particularly convenient for noninvasive continuous measurement of blood oxygen saturation. In contrast, blood gas levels must otherwise be determined in a laboratory on a drawn blood sample. Pulse oximetry is useful in any setting where a patient's oxygenation is unstable, including intensive care, operating, recovery, emergency and hospital ward settings, pilots in unpressurized aircraft, for assessment of any patient's oxygenation, and determining the effectiveness of or need for supplemental oxygen. Although a pulse oximeter is used to monitor oxygenation, it cannot determine the metabolism of oxygen, or the amount of oxygen being used by a patient. For this purpose, it is necessary to also measure carbon dioxide (CO2) levels. It is possible that it can also be used to detect abnormalities in ventilation. However, the use of a pulse oximeter to detect hypoventilation is impaired with the use of supplemental oxygen, as it is only when patients breathe room air that
Document 14 (Title: [Development of a method of continuous monitoring of spontaneous respiration in the postoperative phase. 1. Normal values for cutaneous pO2- and pCO2-partial pressure together with pulse oximetry determined oxygen saturation in healthy young volunteers].): Twenty-eight healthy volunteers of both sexes (14 male, 14 female, age 31 +/- 7 years, weight 70 +/- 12 kg) breathing room air were monitored for cutaneous partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide (pctO2, pctCO2) and partial oxygen saturation (psO2) as determined by pulse oximetry. Data triplets were collected and stored by a personal computer at 30-s intervals during a 4-h resting period to establish a confidence range for the devices in use (TCM 3 with a combination electrode E 5270, and Pulse Oximeter, Radiometer). This data range was intended to be used in later noninvasive, continuous respiratory studies with postoperative patients. Means, standard deviations, and ranges were calculated for individual data and data pooled from 15-min intervals. Data distribution over time was calculated for 30-min intervals. Contrary to the saturation data delivered by pulse oximetry, the pctO2 and pctCO2 readings needed about 15 min to stabilize. The mean +/- SD of a total of 12,600 pctO2 measurements (77.2 +/- 10.9 mmHg) could not simply be compared with arterial normal values, whereas the pctCO2 measurements (39.9 +/- 3.6 mmHg) fit well with arterial data from the literature. Interestingly, pctCO2 values in unmedicated healthy adults were not uniformly distributed, suggesting individual differences in either skin permeability of central regulation of respiration. Additionally, the pctO2 readings were characterized by serious inter-subject variability, which confirms earlier studies that pctO2 is not suitable for routine monitoring procedures in adults, the mean +/- SD of a total of 4500 psO2 measurements was 94.9 +/- 1.6%. A statistically significant correlation was found between pctO2 and psO2 (r = 0.358). Cutaneous carbon dioxide readings of greater than 50 mmHg were observed in only 0.06% of all 12,600 data sets (maximum 51.3 mmHg; 28 volunteers), desaturations (less than 90%) in only 0.24% of all 4,500 saturation measurements (minimum 86%; 10 volunteers). Monitoring of spontaneous respiration in the recovery room is regarded as essential to prevent serious complications resulting from surgery and anesthesia. This has become particularly true with newer analgesic techniques like spinal opiates or patient-controlled analgesia. Since minor degrees of opiate-induced respiratory depression are easily influenced by external stimulation, it is mandatory that any monitoring of spontaneous respiration must be nonstimulant, and prefereably noninvasive. The present communication is the first of a series of investigations to develop of monitoring technique for postoperative patients. Because normal values for the parameters studied are either lacking or dependent on the monitoring devices in use, the present paper defined the respective data ranges. It is concluded that pulse oximetry and pctCO2 measurement are both useful and sensitive for continuous, non-invasive respiratory monitoring in adults, whereas pctO2 measurements are of lesser value. Results in volunteers treated with opiates and postoperative patients under patient-controlled analgesia using the above mentioned equipment will be reported in following publications.
Document 15 (Title: Wide QRS Complex Tachycardia -- Treatment / Management): Physicians must act quickly and determine whether a patient is stable or unstable when during their initial evaluation of WCT. It is critical to first evaluate both the patient’s ABCs (airway, breathing, circulation) and hemodynamic status because it will guide your management in the emergency setting. If the patient is unresponsive, not protecting their airway, or not breathing (but has a pulse) then they should be immediately intubated in order to secure their airway. If a patient has low oxygen saturation on the pulse ox, then supplemental oxygen should be initiated. If a patient does not have a pulse, immediately begin chest compressions and follow ACLS protocol guidelines. Intravenous access, EKG, cardiac rhythm monitoring, and blood pressure monitoring should be started immediately on all patients who complain of chest discomfort. Once a hemodynamically unstable patient is found to have a WCT, emergent cardioversion (or defibrillation) should be your next immediate step as it will reduce morbidity and mortality. It is critical to know how to cardiovert an unstable patient as these two methods of delivering electrical shocks are quite different. The presence or absence of an unstable patient’s pulse is what determines which type of cardioversion will be used. If the patient has a pulse, then synchronized cardioversion will be preferred as it will be coordinated with the heart’s electrical activity (QRS complex) to reduce the risk of inducing cardiac arrest. If the patient does not have a pulse, then this will be considered a cardiac arrest and requires immediate defibrillation. [9] [10]
