In the present study, 3H-methylated G beta gamma complexes cleaved to their constituent amino acids by exhaustive proteolysis were shown to contain radiolabeled material that coeluted with geranylgeranylcysteine methyl ester on reversed-phase HPLC and two TLC systems. Further treatment by performic acid oxidation yielded radiolabeled material that coeluted with L-cysteic acid methyl ester, verifying that the prenyl modification occurs on a C-terminal cysteine residue. Analysis by gas chromatography-coupled mass spectrometry of material released from purified G beta gamma by treatment with Raney nickel positively identified the covalently bound lipid as an all-trans-geranylgeranyl (C20) isoprenoid moiety. To delineate the distribution of this modification among gamma subunits, purified G beta gamma complexes were separated into 5-kDa (gamma 5) and 6-kDa (gamma 6) forms of the gamma polypeptide by reversed-phase HPLC. Gas chromatography-coupled mass spectrometry analyses of Raney nickel-treated purified gamma 5 and gamma 6 subunits showed that both polypeptides were modified by geranylgeranylation.

Acylation with iodoacetic anhydride at pH 6.0 occurs with 90-98% selectivity for the alpha-amino group, depending on the N-terminal residue (as shown with a series of model hexapeptides containing a competing Lys residue). Although Cys residues must be protected (reversibly or irreversibly) before the anhydride reaction, there are no detectable side reactions of the alpha-amino moiety--of the reagent or of modified peptide--with the side chains of His, Met, or Lys. The reaction works well in denaturants, so that inhibitory effects of noncovalent structure can be minimized. In a second step the iodoacetyl-peptide can be reacted with a thiol group on a protein, on a solid chromatography matrix, on a spectroscopic probe, etc. This is illustrated by reaction of a series of N alpha-iodoacetyl-peptides with murine interferon-gamma, which contains a C-terminal Cys residue. Data are presented which suggest that this iodoacetic anhydride scheme is superior in selectivity for alpha-amino groups to conventional chemical approaches to cross-linking such as use of 2-iminothiolane or N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated carboxylic acid esters.

Nonglycosylated completed heavy chains of various classes cannot be glycosylated after release from the ribosome, due either to rapid intramolecular folding and/or intermolecular assembly, which cause the acceptor site to become unavailable for the glycosylation enzyme. Second, we have shown that the formation of the correct intrachain disulfide loop within the first light chain domain occurs rapidly and quantitatively as soon as the appropriate cysteine residues of the nascent light chain pass through the membrane into the cisterna of the endoplasmic reticulum. The intrachain disulfide loop in the second or constant region domain of the light chain is not formed on nascent chains, because one of the cysteine residues involved in this disulfide bond does not pass through the endoplasmic reticulum membrane prior to chain completion and release from the ribosome.

Ubiquitin plays a role in cellular proteolytic degradation and in chromatin structure and has been postulated to be involved in the induction of a set of proteins which function during the cellular response to various kinds of environmental stress. We have measured the various forms of ubiquitin in cultures of chicken embryo fibroblasts under normal growth conditions and after treatment with a thermal or chemical stress.

The level of a protein synthesized as the carboxyl-terminal domain of one ubiquitin fusion protein was unchanged by a heat stress. The most dramatic effect was seen in the rapid disappearance of the ubiquitinated form of histone H2A, one of the major ubiquitin conjugates in cells in the interphase portion of their growth cycle. A significant rise in protein turnover was detected as a result of the stress, but occurred only when cells were removed from the stress condition.

The level of a protein synthesized as the carboxyl-terminal domain of one ubiquitin fusion protein was unchanged by a heat stress. The most dramatic effect was seen in the rapid disappearance of the ubiquitinated form of histone H2A, one of the major ubiquitin conjugates in cells in the interphase portion of their growth cycle. A significant rise in protein turnover was detected as a result of the stress, but occurred only when cells were removed from the stress condition. These results suggest that ubiquitin plays an important role both during and after stress, but fails to support hypotheses for ubiquitin and proteolysis in the activation of stress genes.",

        "content": "The amino acids are linked with their neighbors in a specific order by covalent bonds, also known as peptide bonds. These particular bonds are the amide linkages that form when the amino group reacts with the carboxylate carbon connecting\u00a02 amino acids. The free amino group at\u00a01 end of the polypeptide is typically called the amino-terminal or N-terminal. In contrast, the open carboxyl group at the other end is labeled as the carboxyl-terminal or C-terminal. Protein sequences are written or read from the N-to-C terminal direction. The chains of the amino acids or progression of the amino acids distinguish\u00a01 protein from another exquisitely. The organism's DNA is specific in coding a particular sequence of amino acids. Each protein consists of\u00a01 or more polypeptide chains. Proteins are polymers of 50 or more amino acids, while peptides are shorter amino acid polymers. A protease, which is also known as peptidase or proteinase, is an enzyme that catalyzes proteolysis. This phenomenon is constituted by the breakdown of proteins into smaller polypeptides and, eventually, single amino acids. Proteases cleave the peptide bonds within proteins by hydrolysis, a chemical reaction where the water breaks bonds. Acids, alkalis, or enzymes may be employed to determine protein hydrolysis.

        "content": "Translation is the process by which a mature mRNA molecule is used as a template for synthesizing a new protein. Translation is carried out by ribosomes, large complexes of RNA and protein responsible for carrying out the chemical reactions to add new amino acids to a growing polypeptide chain by the formation of peptide bonds. The genetic code is read three nucleotides at a time, in units called codons, via interactions with specialized RNA molecules called transfer RNA (tRNA). Each tRNA has three unpaired bases known as the anticodon that are complementary to the codon it reads on the mRNA. The tRNA is also covalently attached to the amino acid specified by the complementary codon. When the tRNA binds to its complementary codon in an mRNA strand, the ribosome attaches its amino acid cargo to the new polypeptide chain, which is synthesized from amino terminus to carboxyl terminus. During and after synthesis, most new proteins must fold to their active three-dimensional structure",

        "content": "We studied the post-translational modification of NS26, the protein product of rotavirus gene 11 segment. Based on the presence of a putative N-glycosylation site and the high content of serine and threonine residues in gene 11 amino acid sequence we investigated whether NS26 is modified by carbohydrate addition. Specific antibodies raised against the gene 11 product expressed in Escherichia coli recognized in infected cells two polypeptides with apparent molecular weight of 26,000 (26-kDa polypeptide) and 28,000 (28-kDa polypeptide). Pulse-chase experiments demonstrated that the 26-kDa product was processed to the 28-kDa polypeptide. Both polypeptides were metabolically labeled with [3H]glucosamine, indicating the presence of a carbohydrate moiety on the protein. NS26 was found to be resistant to endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H and endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase F/peptide:N-glycosidase F treatment, but sensitive to removal by alkali-induced beta-elimination, suggesting that the saccharide chain was attached to the protein via an O-glycosidic linkage. Chromatographic analysis of total acid hydrolysates of [3H]glucosamine-labeled NS26-bound carbohydrate indicated the presence of N-acetylglucosamine. In addition, mild alkaline treatment of NS26 in the presence of NaB3H4 identified the O-linked carbohydrate moiety as N-acetylglucosamine. Taken together, these data demonstrate that NS26 is processed to a 28-kDa polypeptide by addition of O-linked monosaccharide residues of N-acetylglucosamine.",
