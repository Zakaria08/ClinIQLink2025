An innovative approach was therefore required to recruit 120 randomly selected family physicians in southern Ontario in a quality of care study by the College of Family Physicians of Canada. A network of physician recruiters oriented to the study was organized for each district. This recruitment method resulted in an 84.5% participation rate. The relationship of these physician recruiters to the candidate and the method of approach were important factors in the enrolment process: the highest participation rate (95%) was obtained when the recruiters were friends of the candidate and when a personal meeting was arranged (91%). Recruiters were given an information package to help them in the recruitment process and rated the most useful items as follows: a policy statement about confidentiality, a description of the study and reprints of a published feasibility study. These results illustrate that cooperation in research in family physicians' offices can become a reality.",

The design was informed by phenomenology in the sense that it was searching for a definition of the lived experience of the phenomenon of TT. Data were obtained through one open-ended interview and a second clarifying interview of each subject. All data were subjected to content analysis. For participants, the lived experience of TT was described as a linear process that began with the perceived need for and decision to seek treatment. It progressed through one or more treatments and continued to have an impact upon the participants' lives. These findings were examined within the context of Martha Rogers' conceptual system. This study has shown that, for 20 participants receiving treatment, TT was a fulfilling multidimensional experience that facilitated personal growth. Such as experience can only enrich the lives of those who receive treatment. Certainly, a nursing intervention that can achieve such a positive influence has potential for use in all areas of nursing care and needs to be explored further.",
