Document 1 (Title: Sudden Infant Death Syndrome -- Deterrence and Patient Education): Medical professionals must be aware of current recommendations for safe sleeping practices and SIDS prevention: do not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs during pregnancy, place the infant on the back to sleep, allow the infant to sleep in his or her own crib in the same room as caregivers, and use a firm and flat surface in a safety-approved crib. Keep soft bedding or objects such as blankets, pillows, bumper pads, or toys out of the sleeping environment. Avoid covering the infant's head and avoid overheating. Avoid second-hand smoke. Smokers should change clothes and wash their hair before coming in contact with the infant. Infants and caregivers benefit from learning to use a pacifier at bedtime - Do Not Prop bottles in the baby's mouth! Breastfeeding and immunizations are beneficial.
Document 2 (Title: Safe to Sleep): In 1992, the first National Infant Sleep Position (NISP) Household Survey was conducted to determine the usual position in which U.S. mothers placed their babies to sleep: lateral (side), prone (stomach), supine (back), other, or no usual position. According to the 1992 NISP survey, 13.0% of U.S. infants were positioned in the supine position for sleep. According to the 2006 NISP survey 75.7% of infants were positioned in the supine position to sleep. According the CDC, the four tips for parents and caregivers to help a baby sleep safety are as follows: 1.)Place your baby on his or her back for all sleep times-naps and at night. 2.)Use a firm sleep surface, such as a mattress in a safety-approved crib. 3.) Keep soft bedding such as blankets, pillows, bumper pads, and soft toys out of baby’s sleep area. 4.) have baby share your room, not your bed.

Document 3 (Title: Biochemistry_Lippinco): 2.2. A 5-month-old boy is brought to his physician because of vomiting, night sweats, and tremors. History revealed that these symptoms began after fruit juices were introduced to his diet as he was being weaned off breast milk. The physical examination was remarkable for hepatomegaly. Tests on the baby’s urine were positive for reducing sugar but negative for glucose. The infant most likely suffers from a deficiency of: A. aldolase B. B. fructokinase. C. galactokinase. D. β-galactosidase.
Document 4 (Title: Can the fall in Avon's sudden infant death rate be explained by changes in sleeping position?): To examine the impact of changing practice with regard to infant sleeping position on mortality from the sudden infant death syndrome. A population based study of all infants dying suddenly and unexpectedly during February 1990 to July 1991, and two groups of controls; one comprising every 125th baby born to Avon residents and the other comprising pairs of infants matched to each index case for age, neighbourhood, and date of study. Information about sleeping position was collected at home visits soon after the index baby's death or, for the population based controls, on several occasions in the first six months of life. The design was comparable to that of an earlier study of the same population. County of Avon. 35 infants who died suddenly and unexpectedly (32 of the sudden infant death syndrome), 70 matched controls, and 152 population based controls. The prevalence of prone sleeping in the matched controls was much lower than that found in an earlier study in Avon (28% (18/64) 1990-1 v 58% (76/131) 1987-9; p less than 0.001) and was comparable with the prevalence in population based controls (29%). This would be expected to lead to a reduction in the incidence of the sudden infant death syndrome to 2.0/1000 live births (95% confidence interval 1.8/1000 to 2.5/1000). The actual mortality fell from 3.5/1000 in 1987-9 to 1.7/1000. The fall in mortality can be almost entirely accounted for by the reduction in prone sleeping, suggesting a causal relation exists between them. Side and supine positions confer protection but the side position is unstable and the infant may roll prone. We therefore recommend supine as the safest sleeping position for babies.
Document 5 (Title: Sudden Infant Death Syndrome -- Deterrence and Patient Education): Despite a widespread campaign advocating for placing the baby in a supine position for sleep, the adherence to such behavior in the United States peaked at about 80% in 2015. Compliance never reached the targeted level. [36] In a large survey in the United States in 2019, 93% of parents recalled hearing about placing the baby in a supine position to sleep from clinicians, and only 78% of parents reported adhering to the recommendation. [37] Furthermore, parents were less likely to recall hearing about other safe sleeping practices, including avoiding soft objects in the vicinity of the bed (85%), safe sleeping surfaces (84%), and room-sharing without bed-sharing (50%).
Document 6 (Title: Neurology_Adams): Two clinical types can be recognized based on the adequacy of motor skills that are acquired in parallel with cognitive skills. In the first, the essential characteristic is that, almost from birth, the infant is delayed in all aspects of development. There is a tendency to sleep more, to be less demanding of nourishment, to move less than normal, and to suck poorly and regurgitate. Parents comment on how good their baby is, how little he troubles them by crying. As the months pass, every expected achievement is late. The baby is usually more hypotonic and turns over, sits unsupported, and walks later than the normal infant. Yet despite these obvious motor delays, there is later no sign of paralysis, ataxia, chorea, or athetosis. These babies do not smile at the usual time and take little notice of the mother or other persons or objects in their environment. They are less attentive to visual, and often to auditory, stimuli, to the point where questions may be raised about blindness or
Document 7 (Title: Plagiocephaly -- Etiology): The incidence of deformational plagiocephaly increased after the "Back to Sleep" campaign started in 1992, which promoted a supine position to prevent sleep-related infant deaths; however, the incidence of sudden infant death syndrome has decreased. [11] Potential risk factors for deformational plagiocephaly include assisted delivery with forceps, vacuum extractor, first-born child, male sex, the supine position at sleep, limited neck rotation, low level of activity, and lack of tummy time. [11] [12] Tummy time is the awake time of the baby spent in the prone position. There is a high association with congenital muscular torticollis. Due to the torticollis, the infant may hold the neck and head in a preferred position for a prolonged period causing flattening of a part of the head. [13]
Document 8 (Title: [Crib death, sleeping position and temperature].): Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is the commonest cause of death in children over one week of age. Norway has the highest incidence in Scandinavia and the figure has increased during the last 20 years. There has been much discussion as to whether sleeping in the prone position rather than in the supine or lateral position may be a predisposing factor to cot death. In all 14 studies in seven countries where the question has been investigated, there was a higher proportion of prone infants in the SIDS group than in the control group. Intervention studies have shown that reducing the proportion of infants sleeping prone was followed by a reduction in cot deaths. There is also evidence that overheating is a risk factor for SIDS. In one British study it was found that infants who died of SIDS had more clothes on, and blankets covering them, and that both prone position and overheating were independently associated with SIDS. A possible mechanism is that overheating interferes with respiratory control. Although we do not completely understand the mechanisms underlying the links between SIDS and the prone position, the epidemiological evidence and the evidence from intervention are now so strong that it is fully justified to advice against the general use of the prone sleeping position for babies.
Document 9 (Title: Sudden infant death syndrome): Prevention A number of measures have been found to be effective in preventing SIDS, including changing the sleeping position to supine, breastfeeding, limiting soft bedding, immunizing the infant and using pacifiers. The use of electronic monitors has not been found to be useful as a preventative strategy. The effect that fans might have on the risk of SIDS has not been studied well enough to make any recommendation about them. Evidence regarding swaddling is unclear regarding SIDS. A 2016 review found tentative evidence that swaddling increases the risk of SIDS, especially among babies placed on their bellies or sides while sleeping. Measures not shown to be useful include positioning devices and baby monitors. Companies that sell the monitors do not have FDA approval for them as medical devices. Sleep positioning
Document 10 (Title: The thermal environment in which 3-4 month old infants sleep at home.): The thermal insulation of clothing and wrapping (tog value), room temperature, and body temperature was measured for 3-4 month old infants sleeping in their home cots under conditions chosen freely by parents during a cold winter. We found that ambient temperature averaged 18.4 degrees C when infants were put down, but fell by an average of 4.4 degrees C during the night. Minimum room temperature correlated with outside temperature, but most rooms were heated to some degree; smaller babies were kept in warmer rooms. The tog value of clothing before putting the baby down averaged 5.1, supplemented by 9.6 tog units of wrapping in the cot--a 188% increase for a 4.4 degrees C drop in temperature. Total tog of clothing and wrapping correlated negatively with minimum room temperature; smaller born babies tended to be more heavily wrapped. Despite the large increase in insulation in the cot, most babies maintained normal body temperatures.
Document 11 (Title: Pediatrics_Nelson): A variety of unproven mechanisms have been proposed to explain SIDS. SIDS is associated with prone position during sleep, especially on soft bedding. The widely advocated supine sleeping position explains, in part, the decreased incidence of SIDS during the past two decades. Current theories for a predisposition to SIDS include cellular brainstem abnormalities and maturational delay related to neural or cardiorespiratory control. A portion of SIDS deaths may be due to prolongation of the Q-T interval, abnormal CNS control of respiration, and CO2 rebreathing from sleeping face down (especially in softbedding). See Table 134-1 for the differential diagnosis of SIDS. There has been a significant decline in SIDS with the backto-sleep program and avoiding soft bedding. Thus, all parents should be instructed to place their infants in the supine position unless there are medical contraindications. All soft Fulminant infection*,† Infant botulism*
Document 12 (Title: Tummy time): Tummy time is a colloquialism for placing infant children in the prone position while awake and supervised, to encourage development of the neck and trunk muscles and prevent skull deformations. In 1992, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended babies sleep on their backs to prevent Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). Although the rate of SIDS decreased by 50% since the Safe to Sleep campaign started in 1994, an unintended consequence was that babies missed out on the twelve or so hours they used to spend in the prone position while asleep, and there was a sharp increase in plagiocephaly (flat head syndrome) in infants. Along with tummy time, rotating the direction infants lie in their cribs as well as avoiding too much time in car seats, carriers, and bouncers are behaviors recommended to alleviate the associated risks of infants sleeping in a supine position. Impact on development
Document 13 (Title: Pathology_Robbins): Among the potential environmental causes, prone sleeping position, sleeping on soft surfaces, and thermal stress are possibly the most important modifiable risk factors for SIDS. Many studies have clearly shown increased risk for SIDS in infants who sleep in a prone position, prompting the American Academy of Pediatrics to recommend placing healthy infants on their backs when laying them down to sleep. This “Back to Sleep” campaign has resulted in substantial decreases in SIDS-related deaths since its inception in 1994. The prone position increases the infant’s vulnerability to one or more recognized noxious stimuli (hypoxia, hypercarbia, and thermal stress) during sleep. In addition, the prone position also is associated with decreased arousal responsiveness compared with the supine position.
Document 14 (Title: Sleeping position and rectal temperature.): The effects of sleeping position upon body temperature were assessed by continuous monitoring of rectal temperature in 137 babies sleeping at home under conditions chosen by their parents. There were three groups of subjects: (1) normal babies aged 12-22 weeks whose temperature rhythms were developed, (2) normal babies aged 6-12 weeks who were developing their night time temperature rhythms, and (3) babies the night after diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus immunisation, whose temperature rhythms were disturbed. Sleeping in the prone position was not associated with higher rectal temperatures at any time of night in young babies, nor did it exaggerate the disturbance of rectal temperature rhythm after immunisation. In older normal babies the prone position did not disturb rectal temperature in the first part of the night, though prone sleepers warmed a little faster prior to walking, especially in warm conditions. Prone sleepers were, however, born earlier in gestation and tended to be of lower birth weight. Normal babies can therefore thermoregulate effectively whatever their sleeping posture, even in warm conditions, though the prone position may make it slightly more difficult to lose heat. It is difficult to see how the prone position, even interacting with warm conditions, could induce lethal hyperthermia in otherwise normal babies. Perhaps the prone position is associated with other risk factors for sudden infant death syndrome.
Document 15 (Title: Night waking in 1-year-old children in England.): A national sample of 1500 mothers of 1-year-old children received a postal questionnaire concerned with the sleeping patterns of their children. The response rate was 69%. Seventeen per cent of mothers reported that their 1-year-old presented a moderate or severe sleep problem and 26% said their child woke at night on at least five nights a week. While these two measures correlated, 10% of those who reported their infant woke on at least five nights a week did not consider this to be a problem. Neither sex of infant, social class, method of infant feeding or numbers of house moves were associated with sleep problems. The pattern of results strongly suggest an association between night waking and other sleeping difficulties and stress for mothers. This was indicated by the association we found with complaints about housing, overcrowding, more negative attitudes toward motherhood, lower assessments of maternal well-being, lack of practical support from partners, the use of more negative adjectives to describe their baby and more frequent feelings of being dominated by their baby. While these associations may be explained by the stresses of living with a night-waking baby, it is also likely that a mother who is feeling somewhat depressed and negative toward her baby is more likely to see night waking as significant and as a problem. There were class differences in how parents coped with a shortage of space. Middle-class parents were more likely to put a baby in with a sibling while working class parents more often had the baby in their own room. Middle-class parents were more likely to leave a night-waking baby to cry.
