Document 1 (Title: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug): Surgical pain Pain following surgery can be significant, and many people require strong pain medications such as opioids. There is some low-certainty evidence that starting NSAID painkiller medications in adults early, before surgery, may help reduce post-operative pain, and also reduce the dose or quantity of opioid medications required after surgery. Any increase risk of surgical bleeding, bleeding in the gastrointestinal system, myocardial infarctions, or injury to the kidneys has not been well studied. When used in combination with paracetamol, the analgesic effect on post-operative pain may be improved. Aspirin Aspirin, the only NSAID able to irreversibly inhibit COX-1, is also indicated for antithrombosis through inhibition of platelet aggregation. This is useful for the management of arterial thrombosis, and prevention of adverse cardiovascular events like heart attacks. Aspirin inhibits platelet aggregation by inhibiting the action of thromboxane A2.
Document 2 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): include the thienopyridines (clopidogrel and prasugrel) and ticagrelor, dipyridamole, and Gp IIb/IIIa antagonists. The most widely used antiplatelet agent worldwide is aspirin. As a cheap and effective antiplatelet drug, aspirin serves as the foundation of most antiplatelet strategies. Mechanism of Action Aspirin produces its antithrombotic effect by irreversibly acetylating and inhibiting platelet cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 (Fig. 143-3), a critical enzyme in the biosynthesis of thromboxane A2. At high doses (~1 g/d), aspirin also inhibits COX-2, an inducible COX isoform found in endothelial cells and inflammatory cells. In endothelial cells, COX-2 initiates the synthesis of prostacyclin, a potent vasodilator and inhibitor of platelet aggregation.
Document 3 (Title: Physiology, Platelet Activation -- Clinical Significance): Aspirin, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug commonly used to treat fever and pain, has also been prescribed to lower the risk of myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke in patients with known cardiovascular disease. Aspirin’s role in decreasing mortality after MI and preventing future events is due to its irreversible inhibition of both cyclooxygenase 1 and 2 enzymes, known for producing prostanoids such as TXA2. Thus, aspirin effectively acts as an antithrombotic medication by inhibiting platelet aggregation even at low doses. As expected, bleeding time increases in patients who consume aspirin, and the drug’s irreversible effect persists until the body produces new platelets.
Document 4 (Title: Perioperative Anticoagulation Management -- Pathophysiology -- Aspirin (Acetylsalicylic Acid)): This agent is the most commonly prescribed antiplatelet drug to prevent cardiovascular disorders. Its mechanism of action is the irreversible inhibition of the cyclooxygenase (COX) 1 and 2 enzymes. The action of COX is necessary for the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin (PG) H2. The PGH2 is rapidly converted to several bioactive prostanoids, including thromboxane A2, a potent vasoconstrictor and an inductor of platelet aggregation. Despite the short half-life of aspirin (3 to 6 hours), its irreversible effects last for the complete lifetime of the platelet (8 to 9 days). After the aspirin therapy interruption, platelet function recovery depends on its turnover (approximately 10% per day). [3] [4]
Document 5 (Title: Antithrombotic effects of a platelet fibrinogen receptor antagonist in a canine model of carotid artery thrombosis.): Platelet-fibrin thrombi in the lumen of atherostenotic carotid arteries may underlie transient ischemic attacks and cerebral infarction. For this reason, we investigated the antiplatelet and antithrombotic effects of a novel and potent platelet fibrinogen receptor (glycoprotein IIb/IIIa) antagonist (SK&amp;F 106760). The effects of 0.1-3.0 mg/kg i.v. SK&amp;F 106760 on platelet aggregation were examined ex vivo in canine platelet-rich plasma (n = 20). In addition, the antithrombotic effects of SK&amp;F 106760 were compared with those of aspirin in an acute canine model of extracranial carotid artery thrombosis with high-grade stenosis. Sham-operated (n = 4), vehicle-treated (n = 6), SK&amp;F 106760-treated (n = 8), aspirin-treated (n = 9), and SK&amp;F 106760+aspirin-treated (n = 5) dogs were examined. The intravenous administration of SK&amp;F 106760 caused a dose-related inhibition of ex vivo platelet aggregation. In the carotid artery thrombosis model, an occlusive thrombus formed at stenotic sites in the region of the carotid bifurcation. The thrombogenic process caused a progressive reduction in carotid blood flow and reduced the cortical microvascular perfusion and electroencephalographic power. Based on nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, the occlusive events depleted the stores of high-energy phosphates (adenosine triphosphate and phosphocreatine) and increased the lactate concentration in the forelimb somatosensory area of the parietal cortex. In this model, the administration of 1 mg/kg i.v. SK&amp;F 106760 prevented thrombosis of the stenotic carotid artery. Consequently, neurophysiological, cerebral hemodynamic, and metabolic parameters were all improved significantly in the SK&amp;F 106760-treated group. No dog receiving SK&amp;F 106760 reoccluded during the 1-hour posttreatment observation period. In contrast, thrombosis of the carotid artery was associated with neurophysiological deterioration in six of the nine dogs treated with 5 mg/kg i.v. aspirin. Both spontaneous and evoked (increased carotid stenosis) aspirin-resistant thrombosis were abolished by SK&amp;F 106760 treatment. These results suggest that antagonism of fibrinogen binding to platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (the final common pathway for aggregation) may represent a new and more effective antithrombotic approach to the treatment of cerebral transient ischemic attacks and infarction associated with extracranial carotid artery disease.
Document 6 (Title: Antithrombotic actions of aspirin in the horse.): The antithrombotic effects of aspirin at two dose rates (4 mg/kg and 11 mg/kg bodyweight [bwt] were evaluated in normal, healthy ponies by measuring template bleeding time. Inhibition of platelet aggregation in response to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and collagen was evaluated and cyclo-oxygenase activity was monitored by radioimmunoassay of thromboxane B2 (TXB2), the stable metabolite of thromboxane A2 (TXA2). TXB2 was measured in serum and platelet rich plasma. Bleeding time was prolonged significantly until 48 h after treatment at 12 mg/kg bwt and until 4 h at the lower dose rate. Synthesis of TXB2 and collagen induced aggregation were diminished for much greater periods with similar results at each of the dose rates. The prolonged effects of aspirin on platelet function occurred in spite of a very short plasma half-life of aspirin, because of its irreversible action on platelet cyclo-oxygenase. The results show that low dose aspirin has a potential role in antithrombotic therapy in horses although the relationship between skin bleeding time in normal horses and improvement of clinical conditions requires further research and evaluation in clinical trials. TXB2 measurement appears to overestimate the duration of antithrombotic effects of aspirin in vivo.
Document 7 (Title: Prevention of reoccluding platelet-rich thrombi in canine femoral arteries with a novel peptide antagonist of platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptors.): The composition of an evolving arterial thrombus may be a determinant of how effectively pharmacologic agents prevent reocclusion after initially successful thrombolysis. In this study, reoccluding platelet- or fibrin-rich thrombi as delineated by scanning electron microscopy were produced selectively in the femoral arteries of dogs with the use of electrically induced vascular injury or implantation of copper wire, respectively. Initial thrombolysis after intravenous infusion of tissue-type plasminogen activator (1 mg/kg over 30 minutes) was less frequent in the preparation producing platelet-rich thrombi than in that producing fibrin-rich thrombi (lysis in 19 of 24 versus 18 of 18, p = 0.06). In dogs with initial arterial recanalization, intravenous infusion of arginine-glycine-aspartate-O-methyltyrosine amide (RGDY), which competes with fibrinogen for binding to platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptors, prevented reocclusion caused by recurrence of platelet-rich thrombi in six of six dogs within 90 minutes; reocclusion occurred in five of seven saline-infused control dogs (p = 0.02). RGDY was only partially effective in preventing reocclusion caused by recurrence of fibrin-rich thrombi (reocclusion in three of six versus five of six controls, p = 0.54). Similar results were obtained with aspirin in both preparations. At least 98% of platelet aggregation induced ex vivo by collagen was inhibited by either RGDY or aspirin. In contrast with aspirin, however, platelet function returned to normal within 1 hour after discontinuation of RGDY. Thus, the relative proportions of platelets or fibrin incorporated into thrombi influence the efficacy of both tissue-type plasminogen activator for inducing thrombolysis and antiplatelet agents for preventing reocclusion. RGDY is a potent, short-acting inhibitor of platelet aggregation that effectively prevents reocclusion under conditions in which platelet deposition predominates.
Document 8 (Title: COX Inhibitors -- Adverse Effects -- Hematologic Effects): Platelet inhibition increases bleeding time. NSAIDs cause reversible COX inhibition; therefore, the duration of platelet inhibition depends on specific pharmacokinetics such as drug dosing and half-life. [16] Non-selective NSAIDs inhibit the anti-aggregate effect of aspirin and cause an increase in cardiovascular risk compared to low-dose aspirin alone. COX-2 selective inhibitors do not impede the antiplatelet effect of aspirin. [2]
Document 9 (Title: The effects of "anti-platelet" drugs on bleeding time and platelet aggregation in normal human subjects.): The effects on hemostasis of several commonly used drugs previously described as inhibiting platelet function were evaluated in a randomized, double-blind study of 54 normal volunteers. The subjects were each given a single dose of aspirin, chlorpromazine, glyceryl guaiacolate, diphenhydramine, indomethacin or lactose placebo. A single dose of aspirin significantly prolonged the template bleeding time and inhibited secondary platelet aggregation two and 24 hours after ingestion. Single doses of indomethacin and chlorpromazine affected aggregation at two hours but had no effect on bleeding time, although multiple doses of indomethacin did prolong bleeding time. Glyceryl guaiacolate inhibited aggregation one hour after ingestion but had no effect on bleeding time. Diphenhydramine did not affect either. These findings suggest that standard doses of many commonly used "anti-platelet" drugs may have little clinical effect on the hemostatic mechanism in normal man. Results of in-vitro platelet-drug incubations may not be directly applicable to in-vivo hemostasis.
Document 10 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): FIGURE 143-3 Site of action of antiplatelet drugs. Aspirin inhibits thromboxane A2 (TXA2) synthesis by irreversibly acetylating cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1). Reduced TXA2 release attenuates platelet activation and recruitment to the site of vascular injury. Clopidogrel and prasugrel irreversibly block P2Y12, a key ADP receptor on the platelet surface; cangrelor and ticagrelor are reversible inhibitors of P2Y12. Abciximab, eptifibatide, and tirofiban inhibit the final common pathway of platelet aggregation by blocking fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor binding to activated glycoprotein (Gp) IIb/IIIa. Vorapaxar inhibits thrombin-mediated platelet activation by targeting protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR-1), the major thrombin receptor on human platelets. platelet inhibition is required, an initial aspirin dose of at least 160 mg should be given.
Document 11 (Title: Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa Inhibitors -- Continuing Education Activity): Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GP IIb/IIIa) inhibitors prevent platelet aggregation by blocking glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptors on their platelet's plasma membrane and inhibiting fibrinogen binding. The available GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors include tirofiban and eptifibatide. These agents, along with aspirin, are used in patients with unstable angina with PCI within 24 hours.
Document 12 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): The prostaglandin thromboxane A2 is an arachidonate product that causes platelets to change shape, release their granules, and aggregate (see Chapter 18). Drugs that antagonize this pathway interfere with platelet aggregation in vitro and prolong the bleeding time in vivo. Aspirin is the prototype of this class of drugs. As described in Chapter 18, aspirin inhibits the synthesis of thromboxane A2 by irreversible acetylation of the enzyme cyclooxygenase. Other salicylates and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs also inhibit cyclooxygenase but have a shorter duration of inhibitory action because they cannot acetylate cyclooxygenase; that is, their action is reversible.
Document 13 (Title: Thromboxane): Thromboxane synthesis inhibitors, in turn, can be classified regarding which step in the synthesis they inhibit: The widely used drug aspirin acts by inhibiting the ability of the COX enzyme to synthesize the precursors of thromboxane within platelets. Low-dose, long-term aspirin use irreversibly blocks the formation of thromboxane A2 in platelets, producing an inhibitory effect on platelet aggregation. This anticoagulant property makes aspirin useful for reducing the incidence of heart attacks. 40 mg of aspirin a day is able to inhibit a large proportion of maximum thromboxane A2 release provoked acutely, with the prostaglandin I2 synthesis being little affected; however, higher doses of aspirin are required to attain further inhibition.
Document 14 (Title: A monoclonal antibody against the platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor complex prevents platelet aggregation and thrombosis in a canine model of coronary angioplasty.): The comparative effects of aspirin and F(ab')2 fragments of monoclonal antibody 7E3 against the platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor on ex vivo platelet aggregation and in vivo thrombosis were studied in a canine coronary balloon angioplasty model. Three groups were studied. Group 1 (n = 8) was pretreated with saline placebo, group 2 (n = 8) was pretreated with 325 mg aspirin, and group 3 (n = 8) was pretreated with 0.8 mg/kg 7E3 F(ab')2. Coronary angioplasty was performed in the left anterior descending coronary artery of open-chest dogs under fluoroscopic control; serial measurements of basal and hyperemic coronary blood flows were then made for 2 hours after application of an external stenosis that decreased hyperemic flow by 50%. There were no significant differences in platelet counts or hemodynamic measurements during the experiments. Platelet aggregation was decreased by treatment: group 1, 64 +/- 13% versus 50 +/- 13% (p = NS); group 2, 57 +/- 4% versus 25 +/- 4% (p less than 0.001); and group 3, 77 +/- 5% versus 10 +/- 6% (p less than 0.0002). Compared with initial measurements, the 7E3 antibody was superior to aspirin in maintaining hyperemic coronary blood flow after release of the external stenosis: group 1, 177 +/- 14 versus 21 +/- 14 ml/min (p less than 0.0003); group 2, 189 +/- 9 versus 110 +/- 28 ml/min (p less than 0.008); and group 3, 194 +/- 12 versus 181 +/- 15 ml/min (p less than 0.02). In group 1, arterial occlusion developed in five dogs, and nonocclusive thrombus was seen in three dogs. In group 2, arterial occlusion developed in one dog, and nonocclusive thrombus was seen in five dogs. No thrombotic material was visualized in group 3 dogs treated with 7E3 F(ab')2. In this animal model, the 7E3 antiplatelet antibody is superior to aspirin in inhibiting platelet aggregation, thrombosis, and acute closure after deep arterial injury caused by coronary balloon angioplasty.
Document 15 (Title: Antiplatelet drug): Aspirin and Triflusal irreversibly inhibits the enzyme COX, resulting in reduced platelet production of TXA2 (thromboxane - powerful vasoconstrictor that lowers cyclic AMP and initiates the platelet release reaction). Dipyridamole inhibits platelet phosphodiesterase, causing an increase in cyclic AMP with potentiation of the action of PGI2 – opposes actions of TXA2 Clopidogrel affects the ADP-dependent activation of IIb/IIIa complex Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antagonists block a receptor on the platelet for fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor. 3 classes: Murine-human chimeric antibodies (e.g., abciximab) Synthetic peptides (e.g., eptifibatide) Synthetic non-peptides (e.g., tirofiban) Epoprostenol is a prostacyclin that is used to inhibit platelet aggregation during renal dialysis (with or without heparin) and is also used in primary pulmonary hypertension.
