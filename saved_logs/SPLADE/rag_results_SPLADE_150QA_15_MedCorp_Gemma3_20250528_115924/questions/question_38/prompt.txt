Document 1 (Title: First_Aid_Step1): Upper motor neuron = everything up (tone, Reflexes • DTRs, toes) Tone • Fasciculations = muscle twitching Babinski +− Positive Babinski is normal in infants Poliomyelitis Caused by poliovirus (fecal-oral transmission). Replicates in oropharynx and small intestine before spreading via bloodstream to CNS. Infection causes destruction of cells in anterior horn of spinal cord (LMN death). Signs of LMN lesion: asymmetric weakness (vs symmetric weakness in spinal muscular atrophy), hypotonia, flaccid paralysis, fasciculations, hyporeflexia, muscle atrophy. Respiratory muscle involvement leads to respiratory failure. Signs of infection: malaise, headache, fever, nausea, etc. CSF shows  WBCs (lymphocytic pleocytosis) and slight  of protein (with no change in CSF glucose). Virus recovered from stool or throat.
Document 2 (Title: Polio): Spinal polio, the most common form of paralytic poliomyelitis, results from viral invasion of the motor neurons of the anterior horn cells, or the ventral (front) grey matter section in the spinal column, which are responsible for movement of the muscles, including those of the trunk, limbs, and the intercostal muscles. Virus invasion causes inflammation of the nerve cells, leading to damage or destruction of motor neuron ganglia. When spinal neurons die, Wallerian degeneration takes place, leading to weakness of those muscles formerly innervated by the now-dead neurons. With the destruction of nerve cells, the muscles no longer receive signals from the brain or spinal cord; without nerve stimulation, the muscles atrophy, becoming weak, floppy and poorly controlled, and finally completely paralyzed. Maximum paralysis progresses rapidly (two to four days), and usually involves fever and muscle pain. Deep tendon reflexes are also affected, and are typically absent or diminished;
Document 3 (Title: Neuroanatomy, Lower Motor Neuron Lesion -- Clinical Significance -- Poliomyelitis): A classic example of solely LMN paralysis, poliomyelitis, has a fecal-oral transmission and is caused by a type of picornavirus: poliovirus. Once infected, the virus replicated in the oropharynx and small intestine before spreading via the bloodstream to the CNS. While replicating in the Peyer's patches of the small intestine, 95% of patients are asymptomatic, and it can only be found in the stool or via an oral swab. [5] In the CNS, the virus destroys the anterior (ventral) horn of the spinal cord, resulting in LMN paralysis. Because LMNs originate in the anterior horn of the spinal cord, this results in LMN signs such as asymmetric weakness, flaccid paralysis, fasciculations, hyporeflexia, and muscle atrophy. The infection could also result in respiratory involvement leading to respiratory paralysis. Other systemic signs of infection include fever, headache, nausea, and malaise. The cerebrospinal fluid would demonstrate increased WBC's and a slight elevation of protein, which is consistent with the viral infection. Once a prominent cause of paralysis, poliomyelitis has almost been eradicated due to widespread vaccination. [6] [7]
Document 4 (Title: Radiculomyelitis following acute haemorrhagic conjunctivitis.): The clinical manifestations and natural history of radiculomyelitis following a newly reported disease--acute haemorrhagic conjunctivitis (AHC)--have been studied in 33 patients in Taiwan, and the following observations made: All the patients in this series were adults at ages ranging from 21 to 55 years; the salient initial neurological manifestations were radicular pains and acute flaccid paralysis which developed from five to thirty-seven days after the onset of AHC. In some patients, signs and symptoms indicating involvement of the meninges, cranial nerves and the white matter of the cord were observed; motor paralysis was the most striking feature during the whole clinical course; it consisted of flaccid asymmetrical weakness in one or more limbs, usually being more severe in the lower limbs than in the upper, and often more proximal than distal. Atrophy in the severely affected muscles usually became apparent in the second or third week of the weakness; the prognosis regarding the return of function in the affected muscles was dependent on the severity of the involvement. Permanent incapacitation due to paralysis and muscular atrophy in the affected proximal muscles of lower limbs was the main sequel in severe cases. The pattern and prognosis of flaccid motor paralysis were reminiscent of acute poliomyelitis in which the anterior horn cells of the spinal cord are mainly involved. Pleocytosis ranging from 11 to 270 per mm3 was noted in the majority of the patients when the cerebrospinal fluid was examined within the first three weeks from the onset of neurological symptoms; the total protein level was raised invariably from the second week onwards in all specimens, and remained so throughout the subsequent course as long as the seventh week or later. Tissue culture neutralization tests were performed on the sera from 9 patients; significant rises in the antibody titres (greater than or equal to 1:16) to AHC virus antigens were found in 8 cases, and in 2 of them a fourfold rise in the paired sera was noted. The differentiation of this syndrome from poliomyelitis and from Guillain-Barré syndrome, the relative freedom of children from neurological complications of AHC and the aetiological relationship of AHC virus to the syndrome have been discussed. It is concluded that this unusual neurological syndrome is caused by the neurovirulent properties of the AHC virus.
Document 5 (Title: Radiculomyelitis complicating acute haemorrhagic conjunctivitis. A clinical study.): Fourteen patients with radiculomyelitis following acute haemorrhagic conjunctivitis (AHC) were seen in Bangkok during October to December 1974. Most patients developed weakness of extremities 2 weeks after AHC. Prodromal symptoms consisted of fever and malaise for a few days, followed by the acute onset of root pain in the legs and flaccid paralysis. Knee and ankle reflexes were absent or diminished. Cerebrospinal fluid examination revealed lymphocytosis and an increase in protein. Electromyographic findings were consistent with anterior horn cell or  motor root lesions. Ten of the 12 cases in which virological studies were performed showed definite serological evidence of AHC virus infection. Six patients received corticosteroid treatment but apart from relief of pain no significant improvement was seen. Motor weakness in 10 patients was less at the end of 2 months, but in 4 it remained unchanged. The occurrence of disabling neurological sequelae calls for effective public health control of AHC outbreak.
Document 6 (Title: Polio): Diagnosis Paralytic poliomyelitis may be clinically suspected in individuals experiencing acute onset of flaccid paralysis in one or more limbs with decreased or absent tendon reflexes in the affected limbs that cannot be attributed to another apparent cause, and without sensory or cognitive loss. A laboratory diagnosis is usually made based on the recovery of poliovirus from a stool sample or a swab of the pharynx. Antibodies to poliovirus can be diagnostic, and are generally detected in the blood of infected patients early in the course of infection. Analysis of the patient's cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which is collected by a lumbar puncture ("spinal tap"), reveals an increased number of white blood cells (primarily lymphocytes) and a mildly elevated protein level. Detection of virus in the CSF is diagnostic of paralytic polio but rarely occurs.
Document 7 (Title: Neuroanatomy, Lateral Corticospinal Tract -- Clinical Significance -- Poliomyelitis): Although almost completely eradicated, poliomyelitis was a prevalent demonstration of damage to the lateral corticospinal tract. Poliovirus is a member of the Picornaviridae family and has a fecal-oral transmission. Once transmitted, it replicates in the oropharynx and small intestine before spreading via the bloodstream to the CNS. In the CNS poliovirus causes the destruction of the cell bodies in the anterior horn of the spinal cord. [3] This results in ipsilateral LMN deficits such as muscle weakness/atrophy, fasciculations, hyporeflexia, and flaccid paralysis. Manifestations of this infection will begin in the legs and ascend until it reaches the respiratory muscles which would cause paralysis and death. Being a viral disease, the CSF will show lymphocytic pleocytosis (increased white blood cells [WBCs]), a slight increase in protein, and no change in glucose. Thanks to the inactivated polio vaccine, this deathly illness is no longer prevalent. In the United States, the commoner form of polio-like illness with similar pathophysiology is caused by other enteroviruses. The epidemics of acute flaccid myelitis caused by different strains of enteroviruses share the same pathophysiology.
Document 8 (Title: Neuroanatomy, Motor Neuron -- Clinical Significance): Poliomyelitis is another lower motor neuron disease. This disease results from poliovirus and results in the destruction of the anterior horn cells. Subsequently, the affected patient will experience weakness and lower motor neuron symptoms, including flaccid paralysis in the lower limbs. Usually, this presents asymmetrically. The patient may also provide a history of muscle aches or muscle spasm that occurred in the recent past. Unfortunately, this weakness and paralysis may extend up to involve the respiratory muscles. Many patients will recover some strength, but may later decompensate into “postpolio syndrome,” which is characterized by the onset of additional weakness, pain, and/or atrophy. Among other viral causes of anterior horn cell destruction are coxsackievirus, West Nile virus, and echovirus. [13]
Document 9 (Title: Lower motor neuron lesion): A lower motor neuron lesion is a lesion which affects nerve fibers traveling from the lower motor neuron(s) in the anterior horn/anterior grey column of the spinal cord, or in the motor nuclei of the cranial nerves, to the relevant muscle(s). One major characteristic used to identify a lower motor neuron lesion is flaccid paralysis – paralysis accompanied by loss of muscle tone. This is in contrast to an upper motor neuron lesion, which often presents with spastic paralysis – paralysis accompanied by severe hypertonia.
Document 10 (Title: Neurology_Adams): Atrophic, areflexic paralysis of muscles of the trunk and limbs relates, of course, to destruction of neurons in the anterior and intermediate horns of the corresponding segments of the spinal cord gray matter. The affected regions can be quite focal or scattered, giving rise, for instance, to permanent paralysis of only one limb. Stiffness and pain in the neck and back, attributed to “meningeal irritation,” are probably related to the mild inflammatory exudate in the meninges and to the generally mild lesions in the dorsal root ganglia and dorsal horns. These lesions also account for the muscle pain and paresthesia in parts that later become paralyzed. Abnormalities of autonomic function are attributable to lesions of autonomic pathways in the reticular substance of the brainstem and in the lateral horn cells in the spinal cord.
Document 11 (Title: Neurology_Adams): 3. Paraplegia indicates weakness or paralysis of both legs. It is most often the result of diseases of the thoracic spinal cord, cauda equina, or peripheral nerves, and rarely, both medial frontal cortices. 4. Quadriplegia (tetraplegia) denotes weakness or paralysis of all four extremities. It may result from disease of the peripheral nerves, muscles, or myoneural junctions; gray matter of the spinal cord; or the upper motor neurons bilaterally in the cervical cord, brainstem, or cerebrum. Diplegia is a special form of quadriplegia in which the legs are affected more than the arms. Triplegia occurs most often as a transitional condition in the development of, or partial recovery from, tetraplegia. 5. Isolated paralysis of one or more muscle groups due to disease of muscle, anterior horn cells, or nerve roots. 6. Nonparalytic disorders of movement (e.g., apraxia, ataxia, rigidity). 7. Hysterical paralysis.
Document 12 (Title: Myelopathy): Presentation Clinical signs and symptoms depend on which spinal cord level (cervical, thoracic, or lumbar) is affected and the extent (anterior, posterior, or lateral) of the pathology, and may include: Upper motor neuron signs—weakness, spasticity, clumsiness, altered tonus, hyperreflexia and pathological reflexes, including Hoffmann's sign and inverted plantar reflex (positive Babinski sign) Lower motor neuron signs—weakness, clumsiness in the muscle group innervated at the level of spinal cord compromise, muscle atrophy, hyporeflexia, muscle hypotonicity or flaccidity, fasciculations Sensory deficits Bowel/bladder symptoms and sexual dysfunction Diagnosis
Document 13 (Title: How to Localize Neurologic Lesions by Physical Examination -- Clinical Significance): Examination of the motor system of a limb includes checking for muscle bulk and fasciculation, muscle tone at joints, the power of muscle groups, deep tendon reflexes, clonus, plantar response, and coordination. In cases of a lower motor neuron type weakness, there is early muscle wasting, fasciculations, hypotonia, hyporeflexia, and a normal plantar response. On the other hand, the upper motor neuron type of weakness is characterized by normal muscle bulk, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, clonus, and an extensor plantar response (positive Babinski sign). Furthermore, the preservation of deep tendon reflexes distinguishes myopathy from neuropathy. Lower motor neuron type weakness can result from any pathology of anterior horn cells, spinal nerve roots, plexus, or peripheral nerves. An upper motor neuron paraplegia can result from myelopathy involving the thoracic spinal cord, while cervical myelopathy would result in quadriplegia. The uppermost dermatomal level of accompanying sensory loss can further localize the lesion to the corresponding spinal segment. Myelopathy is further classified into compressive and non-compressive myelopathy. An example of non-compressive myelopathy is transverse myelitis, which can be partial or complete. Compressive myelopathy can result from compression from the outside, like a vertebral fracture, vertebral metastasis subdural abscess, or hematoma, or from the inside with conditions such as syringomyelia or hematomyelia.
Document 14 (Title: Neurology_Adams): Our own experience with this form of poliomyelitis has consisted of several patients who were referred over the years for paralyzing illnesses initially thought to be Guillain-Barré syndrome (Gorson and Ropper). In each case, the illness began with fever and aseptic meningitis (50 to 150 lymphocytes/mm3 in the CSF), followed by backache and widespread, relatively symmetrical paralysis, including the oropharyngeal muscles in two cases and asymmetrical weakness limited to the arms in two patients. There were no sensory changes. One patient had a mild concurrent encephalitic illness and died months later. The evolving electromyographic changes indicated that the paralysis was caused by a loss of anterior horn cells rather than by a motor neuropathy or a purely motor radiculopathy, but this distinction was not always certain. MRI was remarkable in showing distinct changes in the gray matter of the cord, mainly ventrally (Fig. 32-3). No virus could be isolated from the CSF and serologic
Document 15 (Title: Brown-Séquard Syndrome -- Pathophysiology): Corticospinal tracts: Anterior and lateral corticospinal tracts carry efferents from the primary motor cortex to the ventral horn primary motor neurons. Hemisection of the spinal cord would produce an ipsilateral hemiplegia from the level of the lesion distally. Symptoms of upper and lower motor neuron lesions, including flaccid paralysis, changes in muscle mass, fasciculations, and decreased tone, will be present only at the level of injury. Upper motor neuron control is lost below the level of the lesion, while lower motor neuron pathways and reflex responses remain intact, resulting in spastic paralysis. [10]
