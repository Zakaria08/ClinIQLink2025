        "content": "Five species of genus Plasmodium are known to cause malaria in humans. The vector for Plasmodium spp. is a female A nopheles mosquito that inoculates sporozoites contained in her salivary glands into the puncture wound when feeding. [3] Sporozoites enter peripheral bloodstream and are uptaken by hepatocytes, where they undergo an asexual pre-erythrocytic liver-stage as liver schizonts lasting up to 2 weeks before the onset of the blood stage. [3] [4] As they replicate within hepatocytes, they form motile merozoites that are subsequently released into the bloodstream, where they invade red blood cells (RBC). The process continues through serial cycles of asexual replication of merozoites that go through ring, trophozoite, and schizont stages before forming and releasing new invasive daughter merozoites that consequently infect new RBC, therefore causing a rise in parasite numbers. [3] [5] P. falciparum produces high levels of blood-stage parasites and is known to modify the surface of the infected RBC, creating an adhesive phenotype, e.g. (sticky cell) causing RBC sequestration inside small and middle-sized vessels, removing the parasite from the circulation for nearly half of the asexual cycle. [6] Sequestration leads to splenic parasite clearance avoidance, host cell endothelial damage, and microvascular obstruction. [5] [6] A small fraction of intra-erythrocytic parasites switch to sexual development, producing morphologically distinct male and female gametocytes that reach the host's dermis and are ingested by a mosquito, rendering it infectious to humans. [3] [4] [5] After ingestion by a female A nopheles mosquito, the male micro-gametocytes go through a process of ex-flagellation in the mosquito's midgut, fusing with female macro-gametes to form a zygote. The zygote then reaches the stage of ookinete that migrates through a thin wall, matures into oocyst, producing and upon rupturing, releasing numerous sporozoites that are dispersed throughout mosquitos body, including salivary glands, therefore completing the lifecycle. Gametocytes are hence of vital importance to the transmission cycle of malaria. [2] [4] [7] The clinical symptoms are, however, predominantly a result of the asexual stages of parasite replication in human blood. [5]",

Following destaining of the original H&amp;E and prolonged restaining with warm Giemsa stain, encysted schizonts, protected by a hyaline wall, were discovered in the connective tissue or capillary endothelium of lung, liver, brain, heart, pancreas, kidney, intestine wall, testis, and both intra- and intermuscularly in the femoral muscles.

These periods can be shorter when the infection is very virulent or longer when chronical. 2--The drop in infectivity coincides with the increase in number of the altered gametocytes. 3--The loss of infectivity is connected with the condition of the blood: when parasitaemiae are high, it becomes rapidly unsuitable to a normal evolution of the gametocytes: thus, non infective gametocytes acquire a good infectivity in less than two hours when transfered to a clean mouse. 4--The gametocytic composition of the blood taken up by the Anopheles in the capillaries can be very different from that taken at the tail of a Rodent. In the young parasitaemiae, when the Rodents are most infective to the Mosquitoes, there is a considerable enrichment in gametocytes O-I of the blood ingested by the Anopheles as compared to that taken from the Rodents by the usual techniques. This phenomenon could perhaps be explained by the larger size of gametocytes O and I and their retention in the capillaries of the host. 5--The strong infectivity of gametocytes O and I is confirmed by the fact that no infection develops in the Mosquitoes when no such gametocytes are present in the ingested blood. 6--The ageeing of gametocytes appears to be very rapid for gametocytes arising from exo-erythrocytic schizontes reach stage II, 29 hours and stage III, 35 hours, after the rupture of the very first schizonts.",

        "content": "Haemogregarina balli sp. n. is described from the blood and organs of the common snapping turtle Chelydra serpentina serpentina and from the gastric and intestinal ceca of the presumed invertebrate hosts, the leeches Placobdella parasitica and Placobdella ornata. In the peripheral blood of the turtle, male and female gametocytes and immature erythrocytic schizonts are found within erythrocytes. The maturation of erythrocytic schizonts containing 6-8 merozoites is recorded from liver imprints. Schizonts with 13-25 merozoites are found in various cells of the liver, lung and spleen. In the gastric ceca of the leeches the host erythrocytes are digested, releasing the gametocytes and immature erythrocytic schizonts. Immature erythrocytic schizonts degenerate. Association of the gametocytes occurs in the intestinal ceca. The microgametocyte apparently gives rise to 4 nonmotile microgametes, one of which fertilizes the macrogamete while the other remain as condensed' residual nuclei on the periphery of the developing oocyst. The oocyst increases in size with maturity. A mature oocyst produces 8 sporozoites from a single germinal center. Sporozoites liberated from the oocyst are found in the tissues of the leech. Transovarial transmission of the parasite does not occur in the turtle. Attempts at experimental transmission failed. Previously unfed (control) leeches were negative for the parasite. Haemogregarina balli is compared with other haemogregarines described from C. serpentina. Features of species of Haemogregarina and Hepatozoon as well as the taxonomy of these genera are discussed.",

        "content": "Microscopic motile forms of malarial parasites are carried rapidly via the bloodstream to the liver. While in the liver, they invade hepatic parenchymal cells and begin a period of asexual reproduction. This process is known as an intrahepatic or pre-erythrocytic stage. P. ovale typically spends nine days in the pre-erythrocytic stage leading to the\u00a0formation of sporozoites. P. ovale spends about 50 hours in an erythrocytic cycle. By the end of the 50 hours, the parasite has consumed nearly all of the hemoglobin and grown to occupy most of the red blood cells. At this stage, it is called a schizont. A single P. ovale sporozoite may produce about 15,000 daughter merozoites per infected hepatocyte.",
