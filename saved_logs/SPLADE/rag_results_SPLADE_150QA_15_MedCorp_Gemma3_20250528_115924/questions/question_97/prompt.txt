Document 1 (Title: Middle Cerebral Artery Stroke -- Continuing Education Activity): Objectives: Identify the various potential etiologies of middle cerebral artery stroke. Summarize the most important evaluations needed to diagnose a middle cerebral artery stroke. Outline the differential diagnoses that must be considered if a patient presents with stroke-like symptoms but does not have a stroke. Review how to address the modifiable risk factors for secondary stroke prevention after a stroke, and how the interprofessional team can be involved in improving the outcome and quality of life of a stroke patient. Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.
Document 2 (Title: Hypercholesterolemia): Medication Statins are the typically used medications, in addition to healthy lifestyle interventions. Statins can reduce total cholesterol by about 50% in the majority of people, and are effective in reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease in both people with and without pre-existing cardiovascular disease. In people without cardiovascular disease, statins have been shown to reduce all-cause mortality, fatal and non-fatal coronary heart disease, and strokes. Greater benefit is observed with the use of high-intensity statin therapy. Statins may improve quality of life when used in people without existing cardiovascular disease (i.e. for primary prevention). Statins decrease cholesterol in children with hypercholesterolemia, but no studies as of 2010 show improved outcomes and diet is the mainstay of therapy in childhood.
Document 3 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): After the clinical diagnosis of stroke is made, an orderly process of evaluation and treatment should follow (Fig. 446-1). The first goal is to prevent or reverse brain injury. Attend to the patient’s airway, breathing, and circulation (ABCs), and treat hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia if identified. Perform an emergency noncontrast head CT scan to differentiate between ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke; there are no reliable clinical findings that conclusively separate ischemia from hemorrhage, although a more depressed level of consciousness, higher initial blood pressure, or worsening of symptoms after onset favor hemorrhage, and a deficit that is maximal at onset, or remits, suggests ischemia. Treatments designed to reverse or lessen the amount of tissue infarction and improve clinical outcome fall within six categories: (1) medical support, (2) IV thrombolysis, (3) endovascular revascularization, (4) antithrombotic treatment, (5) neuroprotection, and (6) stroke centers and
Document 4 (Title: rCBF-SPECT in brain infarction: when does it predict outcome?): We prospectively studied 26 patients with ischemic stroke within 24 hr, after 2 wk, and after 6 mo with thallium-201-diethyldithiocarbamate single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and neurologic and functional assessments. The admission flow deficits correlated with outcome. The admission and 6-mo scores correlated with clinical conditions at each time. At 2 wk, the flow deficits were smaller and did not correlate with clinical parameters. Nor did the presence or absence of hyperfixation of the radiopharmaceutical. Six months after the infarct, the flow defect had decreased in 9 of 15 patients in whom three serial scans were available, with better clinical improvement than in the remaining six whose flow deficits increased. More patients in the first group had been treated randomly with the calcium-entry blocker flunarizine. SPECT imaging of rCBF within 24 hr after stroke correlates with clinical outcome and condition, whereas rCBF imaging at 2 wk after the stroke shows no clinical correlation.
Document 5 (Title: Neurology_Adams): In a trial of statins, the institution of high doses of drug reduced the incidence of subsequent stroke after a TIA or first stroke by 2 percent over 5 years (see Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Investigators [SPARCL trial]). Other large studies with lower doses of statin drugs have not shown this effect. These findings with high doses have, at the moment, been adopted into routine practice. Recent guidelines encourage LDL concentrations of less than 70 mg/dL for secondary stroke prevention. Early anticoagulation after an acute stroke carries an uncertain risk of hemorrhagic transformation of an ischemic infarct. In particular, patients with very large cerebral infarcts that have a component of deep (basal ganglionic) tissue damage, especially in those patients who are also hypertensive, there may be a risk of anticoagulant-related hemorrhage into the acute infarct—“hemorrhagic conversion” (Shields et al).
Document 6 (Title: Evaluation of long-term outcome and safety after hemodilution therapy in acute ischemic stroke.): In a previous single-center, randomized controlled trial including 102 patients treated in a stroke unit, we showed that rapid, modest hemodilution improved short-term clinical outcome in ischemic stroke patients. I now evaluate the long-term outcome and potential risks of this combined venesection/dextran 40 therapy in the same 52 treated and 50 control patients. Mortality, need for institutional care, and recurrent strokes were registered during 1 year following inclusion in the trial, and a final evaluation of functional outcome was performed at 12 months after the stroke. Cerebrospinal fluid was analyzed for protein content and hemorrhagic admixture at two occasions during the acute phase. Thirty-six hemodiluted and 30 control patients survived the first year following the stroke (difference not significant). One year after the stroke, persistent neurological deficits were less frequent among the hemodiluted patients and a larger proportion of hemodiluted survivors was independent in walking (92% versus 73%, p less than 0.05). Two hemodiluted patients (6%) and nine control patients (30%) were totally dependent in the activities of daily living (p less than 0.05). Three hemodiluted patients (8%) and eight control patients (27%) remained hospitalized 1 year after the stroke (p less than 0.05). With the possible exception of patients with a medical history of congestive heart failure, subset analyses revealed a tendency toward improved outcome for hemodiluted patients in all clinically important subgroups compared with the controls. When analyzing cerebrospinal fluid, signs of blood-brain barrier breakdown and hemorrhagic admixture to the cerebrospinal fluid during the acute phase were less frequent in the hemodiluted subjects. These results suggest that, when applied in a stroke unit, the combination of venesection and dextran 40 administration is a clinically safe, therapeutic regimen in the treatment of acute cerebral infarction that improves long-term clinical outcome.
Document 7 (Title: Haemodilution in acute stroke: results of the Italian haemodilution trial. Italian Acute Stroke Study Group.): In a multicentre clinical trial 1267 patients with hemispheric stroke of duration 12 h or less and haematocrit of 35% or more were prospectively randomised to either haemodilution (by venesection and replacement of the same volume of dextran 40 in saline solution) or control treatment groups. In the haemodiluted group mean haematocrit declined from 43% to 37% at 48 h and this fall was maintained for seven days. A plain computed tomographic scan was obtained in all but 37 patients. 87% of the strokes were infarcts and 13% were haemorrhages. After six months the numbers of dead or severely disabled patients were equally distributed in the two treatment groups, and this was true also within the ischaemic and haemorrhagic subgroups. Furthermore, haemodilution did not improve outcome either in the group with very recent ischaemic stroke (less than 6 h) or in the subgroup with highest haematocrit (greater than 45%). Thus, moderate haemodilution does not improve the outcome in acute stroke patients.
Document 8 (Title: Statin): Cognitive effects Multiple systematic reviews and meta-analyses have concluded that the available evidence does not support an association between statin use and cognitive decline. Statins have been shown to decrease the risk of dementia, Alzheimer's disease, and improve cognitive impairment in some cases. Additionally, both the Patient-Centered Research into Outcomes Stroke Patients Prefer and Effectiveness Research (PROSPER) study and the Health Protection Study (HPS) demonstrated that simvastatin and pravastatin did not affect cognition for patients with risk factors for, or a history of, vascular diseases. There are reports of reversible cognitive impairment with statins. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) package insert on statins includes a warning about the potential for non-serious and reversible cognitive side effects with the medication (memory loss, confusion).
Document 9 (Title: Statin): No studies have examined the effect of statins on cognition in patients with prior stroke. However, two large studies (HPS and PROSPER) that included people with vascular diseases reported that simvastatin and pravastatin did not impact cognition. Statins have been studied for improving operative outcomes in cardiac and vascular surgery. Mortality and adverse cardiovascular events were reduced in statin groups. Older adults who receive statin therapy at time of discharge from the hospital after an inpatient stay have been studied. People with cardiac ischemia not previously on statins at the time of admission have a lower risk of major cardiac adverse events and hospital readmission two years post-hospitalization. Comparative effectiveness While no direct comparison exists, all statins appear effective regardless of potency or degree of cholesterol reduction. Simvastatin and pravastatin appear to have a reduced incidence of side-effects.
Document 10 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): (See also Chap. 446) Stroke is a common cause of neurologic critical illness. Hypertension must be managed carefully, since abrupt reductions in blood pressure may be associated with further brain ischemia and injury. Acute ischemic stroke treated with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) has an improved neurologic outcome when treatment is given within 3 h of onset of symptoms. The mortality rate is not reduced when tPA is compared with placebo, despite the improved neurologic outcome. The risk of cerebral hemorrhage is significantly higher in patients given tPA. No benefit is seen when tPA therapy is given beyond 3 h after symptom onset. Heparin has not been convincingly shown to improve outcomes in patients with acute ischemic stroke. Decompressive cra-1735 niectomy is a surgical procedure that relieves increased intracranial pressure in the setting of space-occupying brain lesions or brain swelling from stroke; available evidence suggests that this procedure may improve survival
Document 11 (Title: Urgent therapy for stroke. Part II. Pilot study of tissue plasminogen activator administered 91-180 minutes from onset.): Renewed interest in thrombolytic therapy as potential treatment for patients with acute ischemic stroke prompted a dose-escalation safety study of tissue plasminogen activator in patients with very early (less than or equal to 90 minutes; see Part I) neurological symptoms. To test whether this stringent entry window might be safely lengthened, a second study was organized to test tissue plasminogen activator in patients with symptoms of 91-180 minutes' duration before treatment. An open-label, dose-escalation design was chosen. Eligible patients had pretreatment head computerized tomographic scanning and treatment begun 91-180 minutes from stroke onset. End points examined included the incidence of symptomatic and asymptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, other bleeding, and clinical outcome at 2 hours, 24 hours, and 3 months after treatment. Twenty patients were treated at three hospitals in 13 months. Three doses were tested: 0.6 mg/kg (n = 8), 0.85 mg/kg (n = 6), and 0.95 mg/kg (n = 6). Two patients, one each at the two highest doses, sustained fatal intracerebral hemorrhages. Three patients (15%) improved by greater than or equal to 4 points on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale by 24 hours. These observations suggest that tissue plasminogen activator treatment of acute ischemic stroke 91-180 minutes from onset in doses of greater than or equal to 0.85 mg/kg is attended by a risk of intracerebral hemorrhage approximating 17% (range 3-44%, 95% confidence interval). The rate of early neurological improvement observed in this study was small but does not exclude an improvement over the natural history. Future study with placebo control subjects and stratification by time to treatment is indicated.
Document 12 (Title: Neurology_Adams): but, interestingly, found that regions just adjacent to them are hyperperfused. These concepts find a parallel in attempts to demonstrate by imaging matching of perfusion and infarction (detected by diffusion-weighted images on MRI) in patterns with acute stroke as discussed in the section on treatment. Elevating the systemic blood pressure or improving the rheologic flow properties of blood in small vessels by hemodilution improves flow in the penumbra; however, attempts to use that techniques in clinical work has met with mixed success. Reperfusion of the penumbral area by removal of the occluding clot has, however, been successful in improving outcome after stroke.
Document 13 (Title: Benefit of a stroke unit: a randomized controlled trial.): In a randomized controlled trial we compared the clinical outcome of acute stroke patients, 110 of whom were allocated to treatment in a stroke unit and 110 to treatment in general medical wards. No significant difference existed between these groups with regard to sex, age, marital status, medical history, or functional impairment on admission. Outcome was measured at 6 and 52 weeks after the stroke by the proportion of patients at home, the proportion of patients in an institution, the mortality, and the functional state. After 6 weeks 56.4% of the patients randomized to the stroke unit and 32.7% of the patients randomized to the general medical wards were at home (p = 0.0004), and after 52 weeks 62.7% and 44.6%, respectively, were at home (p = 0.002). After 6 weeks 36.3% of the patients from the stroke unit and 50.0% from the general medical wards were in an institution (p = 0.02); after 52 weeks 12.7% and 22.7%, respectively, were institutionalized (p = 0.016). After 6 weeks mortality was 7.3% for the stroke unit group and 17.3% for the general medical wards group (p = 0.027). After 52 weeks mortality was 24.6% for the stroke unit group and 32.7% for the general medical wards group (difference not significant). Functional state was significantly better for patients treated in the stroke unit after both 6 and 52 weeks. We conclude that care of patients with acute stroke in a stroke unit improves clinical outcome compared with treatment in general medical wards.
Document 14 (Title: Stroke): 30 to 50% of stroke survivors suffer post-stroke depression, which is characterized by lethargy, irritability, sleep disturbances, lowered self-esteem and withdrawal. Depression can reduce motivation and worsen outcome, but can be treated with social and family support, psychotherapy and, in severe cases, antidepressants. Psychotherapy sessions may have a small effect on improving mood and preventing depression after a stroke, however psychotherapy does not appear to be effective at treating depression after a stroke. Antidepressant medications may be useful for treating depression after a stroke.
Document 15 (Title: Wernicke Aphasia -- Treatment / Management): When the cause of Wernicke’s aphasia is a stroke, recovery of language function peaks within two to six months, after which time further progress is limited. However, efforts should be made to try to improve communication, since an improvement in aphasia has been documented long after a stroke. Family support and social support are essential to a good outcome. Treatment of post-stroke depression and post-stroke cognitive issues, as well as remediation of other neurological disorders such as neglect, agnosia, and hemiparesis, should be addressed during rehabilitation to optimize patient outcome.
