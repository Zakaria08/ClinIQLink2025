Document 2 (Title: Epidural administration): Society and culture Some people continue to be concerned that women who are administered epidural analgesia during labor are more likely to require a cesarean delivery, based on older observational studies. However, evidence has shown that the use of epidural analgesia during labor does not have any statistically significant effect on the necessity to perform a cesarean delivery. A 2018 Cochrane review found no increase in the rate of Caesarean delivery when epidural analgesia was employed. However, epidural analgesia does lengthen the second stage of labor by 15 to 30 minutes, which may increase the risk a delivery must be assisted by instruments.
Document 3 (Title: Caudal Anesthesia -- Indications): Historically, caudal epidural analgesia with catheter placement was used for labor analgesia during the second stage of labor. However, concerns about its efficacy, the risk of limb paralysis due to large volumes of local anesthetic, and significant maternal hypotension from inadequate sympathectomy control led to a shift toward lumbar epidurals as the primary method for labor analgesia. [11]
Document 4 (Title: Anesthesia for Labor, Delivery, and Cesarean Section in High-Risk Heart Disease -- Issues of Concern -- Neuraxial Anesthesia): The 2 main methods of neuraxial anesthesia during labor and delivery are epidural anesthesia and combined spinal-epidural anesthesia. Epidural anesthesia generally has a slower onset to peak effectiveness at 15 to 20 minutes and provides greater sacral dermatomal coverage with more uniformity in the sensory blockade. Combined spinal-epidural is preferred for initiating analgesia in cases of advanced labor due to its expedited onset in 2 to 5 minutes. Some practices are performing dural puncture epidural anesthesia in place of combined spinal-epidural. [8] [9] Modern labor analgesia regimens for epidurals typically consist of a combination of a dilute local anesthetic with a low-dose opioid (ie, bupivacaine and fentanyl). The combination of 2 low-dose analgesics reduces the risk of local anesthetic systemic toxicity and a high or total spinal anesthetic (encountered with unintentional intrathecal injection). Hemodynamic effects and placental transfer are minimized via this technique. Dilute local anesthetics help mitigate the risk of motor block, which would necessitate instrumental delivery due to compromised ability to push. Initiation of epidural anesthesia involves a bolus of an amide local anesthetic (ie, bupivacaine or ropivacaine) with a lipid-soluble opioid (ie, fentanyl or hydromorphone). After an initial bolus, maintenance of epidural anesthesia can be obtained through various combinations of techniques, including continuous infusion, intermittent bolus, or patient-controlled bolus. An opioid-only intrathecal dose, such as 25 micrograms of fentanyl, provides excellent analgesia for the first and second stages of labor while maintaining hemodynamic stability. Still, it is associated with a high incidence of pruritis. [10] [8]
Document 5 (Title: Epidural administration): Epidural analgesia is considered a safer and more effective method of relieving pain in labor as compared to intravenous or oral analgesia. In a 2018 Cochrane review of studies which compared epidural analgesia with oral opiates, some advantages of epidural analgesia included better efficacy, fewer instances of naloxone use in newborns, and decreased risk of maternal hyperventilation. Some disadvantages of epidurals included an increase in the number of Caesarian sections required due to fetal distress, a longer labor, increased need for oxytocin to stimulate uterine contractions, an increased risk of low blood pressure and muscle weakness, as well as fever. However, the review found no difference in overall Caesarean delivery rates, and no evidence of negative effects to the baby soon after birth. Furthermore, the occurrence of long-term backache was unchanged after epidural use. Complications of epidural analgesia are rare, but may include headaches, dizziness, difficulty breathing
Document 6 (Title: The effect of continuous epidural analgesia on cesarean section for dystocia in nulliparous women.): Epidural analgesia in labor is generally accepted as safe and effective and therefore has become increasingly popular. However, little is known regarding the effect of epidural analgesia on the incidence of cesarean section for dystocia in nulliparous women. During the first 6 months of 1987 we studied 711 consecutive nulliparous women at term, with cephalic fetal presentations and spontaneous onset of labor. Comparison of 447 patients who received epidural analgesia in labor with 264 patients who received either narcotics or no analgesia was performed. The incidence of cesarean section for dystocia was significantly greater (p less than 0.005) in the epidural group (10.3%) than in the nonepidural group (3.8%). There remained a significantly increased incidence (p less than 0.005) of cesarean section for dystocia in the epidural group after selection bias was corrected and the following confounding variables were controlled by multivariate analysis: maternal age, race, gestational age, cervical dilatation on admission, use of oxytocin, duration of oxytocin use, maximum infusion rate of oxytocin, duration of labor, presence of meconium, and birth weight. The incidence of cesarean section for fetal distress was similar (p greater than 0.20) in both groups. There were no clinically significant differences in frequency of low Apgar scores at 5 minutes or cord arterial and venous blood gas parameters between the two groups. This study suggests that epidural analgesia in labor may increase the incidence of cesarean section for dystocia in nulliparous women.
Document 7 (Title: Lumbar epidural analgesia for labor and delivery of twins.): In this study we examined the effects on mother and infants of epidural analgesia for labor and delivery of twins. Fourteen women with twins received lumbar epidural analgesia. Maternal radial artery and umbilical vessel blood-gas and acid-base measurements together with Apgar scores were determined. Resulting values were compared to those of women receiving epidural analgesia for labor and delivery of one infant. Apgar scores and blood-gas values for first twins were virtually the same as for singleton controls. Our small series confirms the problem of second-twin compromise, but this was minimal and was more pronounced in nonvertex presentations, as would be expected. We believe there is much to recommend lumber epidural analgesia for labor and delivery of twins, and that it is a safe form of analgesia in this situation.
Document 8 (Title: The effect of delayed pushing in the second stage of labor with continuous lumbar epidural analgesia.): We studied primigravid women in spontaneous labor at term and given epidural analgesia. Two hundred such women giving birth in 1983 were compared with similar groups who gave birth in 1985 and 1987 after the introduction of 'delayed pushing' into our labor ward protocol. Four hundred controls were obtained in 1983 and 1985 by selecting from the labor ward register the next normal primigravid woman in spontaneous labor without epidural analgesia. The assisted delivery rate was significantly higher in all three epidural groups than in the controls (p less than 0.001). Among epidural labors, there was no significant difference between 1983 and 1987 in the incidence of rotational or non-rotational forceps, or of cesarean section. In each epidural group, women who waited more than 60 min were less likely to experience a normal spontaneous delivery than were those who did not (p less than 0.001 in 1983; p = 0.006 in 1985 p = 0.035 in 1987). We conclude that to delay pushing beyond 60 min confers no benefit regarding mode of delivery.
Document 9 (Title: Epidural analgesia in labor and fetal hyperthermia.): To assess the effect of epidural analgesia on fetal temperature in labor, contrasting intrauterine with oral thermometry. Fetal skin and maternal uterine wall temperatures were measured with an intrauterine probe in 57 laboring women at term. Maternal oral temperatures were measured in the normal way by birth attendants unaware that their measurements would be examined. Maximum recorded fetal, uterine, and oral temperatures were compared. Epidural analgesia resulted in a significant fetal temperature rise compared with other methods of analgesia. Duration of epidural analgesia correlated with the fetal temperature (R = 0.44, P = .012). Oral thermometry underestimated fetal temperature in 95% of the studies. We estimate that 5% of fetuses reached a core temperature in excess of 40C in this study, all in association with epidural analgesia. We suggest that antipyretic measures be considered after 5 hours of epidural analgesia in ambient temperatures above 24C.
Document 10 (Title: Epidural (Archived) -- Technique or Treatment -- Patient-controlled Epidural Analgesia (PCEA)): This technique was described in 1988 by Gambling for the first time. [18] The implementation of this method allows the patient to adjust the time of local anesthetic dosing to contractions and modify the intervals as labor progresses. One of the downsides of this method is the elevated cost of the equipment when compared to the CEP technique. Also, more training and staff education are involved. On the other hand, PCEA has shown lower total dose usage of bupivacaine and ropivacaine compared to CEI. [19] [20]
Document 11 (Title: Obstentrics_Williams): This association among epidural analgesia and prolonged second-stage labor and operative vaginal delivery has been attributed to anesthesia-induced motor blockade and resultant impaired matenal expulsive eforts. Craig and colleagues (2015) randomized 310 nulliparous women with labor epidural analgesia to bupivacaine plus fentanyl or fentanyl alone during second-stage labor. Epidural bupivacaine analgesia did cause motor blockade during the second stage, however, the duration of the second stage was not increased. TABLE 25-8.

Document 12 (Title: Epidural administration): Uses Pain relief during childbirth Epidural injections are commonly used to provide pain relief (analgesia) during childbirth. This usually involves epidural injection of a local anesthetic and opioids, commonly called an "epidural". This is more effective than oral or intra venal (IV) opioids and other common modalities of analgesia in childbirth. After an epidural is administered, a woman may not feel pain, but may still feel pressure. Epidural clonidine is rarely used but has been extensively studied for management of analgesia during labor.
Document 13 (Title: Effects of epidural analgesia: some questions and answers.): The effects of epidural analgesia on first labors have been studied by Thorp and colleagues. One study has been published and is the subject of a question-and-answer discussion, presented here. In this study 711 consecutive nulliparous women at term, with spontaneous onset of labor and cephalic presentation, were divided into one group (n = 447) who received epidural analgesia in labor and another group (n = 264) who received narcotics or no analgesia. The frequency of cesarean section for dystocia was significantly greater (p less than 0.005) in the epidural group (10.3%) than in the nonepidural group (3.8%), even after selection bias was corrected and the variables of maternal age and race; gestational age; cervical dilatation on admission; use, duration, and maximum infusion rate of oxytocin; labor duration; presence of meconium; and birth weight were controlled. For both groups the frequency of cesarean section for fetal distress was similar (p less than 0.20), and the frequency of low Apgar scores at 5 minutes and cord blood gas values showed no significant differences. The authors concluded that "epidural analgesia in labor may increase the incidence of cesarean section for dystocia in nulliparous women".
Document 14 (Title: Hydrocodone -- Administration -- Specific Patient Populations): Per the guidelines of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), if opioid use is deemed necessary during labor, preference is given to short-acting agents that are easily titratable and associated with a reduced risk of respiratory depression in the newborn. In the United States, commonly used opioids for peripartum analgesia include fentanyl, remifentanil, morphine, butorphanol, and nalbuphine. Remifentanil, an ultrashort-acting opioid, is administered intravenously (IV) through patient-controlled analgesia, offering enhanced pain relief during labor. Given the risk of apneic episodes, it is crucial to implement appropriate respiratory monitoring. [17]
Document 15 (Title: Epidural administration): In many women given epidural analgesia during labor oxytocin is also used to augment uterine contractions. In one study which examined the rate of breastfeeding two days following epidural anesthesia during childbirth, epidural analgesia used in combination with oxytocin resulted in lower maternal oxytocin and prolactin levels in response to breastfeeding on the second day following birth. This results in a decrease in the amount of milk produced. Technique Anatomy
