With your own knowledge and the help of the following document:

Document 1 (Title: Use of antibiotics during pregnancy.): Pregnancy is occasionally complicated by infections that necessitate antibiotic therapy. When considering therapeutic options for pregnant women, both the physiologic changes of pregnancy and the prenatal effects of the drug must be weighed. Antibiotics should be selected with regard to the trimester of pregnancy. Some antibiotics are safe for use throughout pregnancy, while others are completely contraindicated. Choosing the proper antibiotic requires balancing the seriousness of the infection with the antibiotic's safety and antimicrobial activity.
Document 2 (Title: Whooping cough): Treatment The antibiotics erythromycin, clarithromycin, or azithromycin are typically the recommended treatment. Newer macrolides are frequently recommended due to lower rates of side effects. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) may be used in those with allergies to first-line agents or in infants who have a risk of pyloric stenosis from macrolides. A reasonable guideline is to treat people age >1 year within 3 weeks of cough onset and infants age <1 year and pregnant women within 6 weeks of cough onset. If the person is diagnosed late, antibiotics will not alter the course of the illness, and even without antibiotics, they should no longer be spreading pertussis. When used early, antibiotics decrease the duration of infectiousness, and thus prevent spread. Short-term antibiotics (azithromycin for 3–5 days) are as effective as long-term treatment (erythromycin 10–14 days) in eliminating B. pertussis with fewer and less severe side effects.
Document 3 (Title: Rhodococcus Equi -- Treatment / Management): A single agent, such as extended-spectrum macrolide or fluoroquinolone, may be sufficient for immunocompetent hosts. In contrast, using 2 or more agents for immunocompromised hosts is preferable, with at least 1 demonstrating good macrophage penetration. Antibiotic options include vancomycin, linezolid, carbapenems, fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, macrolides, and rifampin. When the central nervous system (CNS) is involved, selecting multiple agents with good CNS penetration is favored. [23] [24] [25] [26]
Document 4 (Title: Gynecology_Novak): Tissue hypoxia secondary to UAE causes postprocedural pain that usually requires pain management in the hospital for 1 day. NSAID medications are usually taken for 1 to 2 weeks, and many women return to normal activity within 1 to 3 weeks. Approximately 5% to 10% of women have pain for longer than 2 weeks (165). Ten percent of women require readmission to the hospital for postembolization syndrome, characterized by diffuse abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, low-grade fever, malaise, anorexia, and leucocytosis. Treatment with intravenous ﬂuids, NSAID medications, and pain management usually leads to resolution of symptoms within 2 to 3 days (165). Persistent fever should be managed with antibiotics. Failure to respond to antibiotics may indicate sepsis, which needs to be aggressively managed with hysterectomy.
Document 5 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Therapy with a macrolide or a fluoroquinolone within the previous 3 months is associated with an increased likelihood of infection with a resistant strain of S. pneumoniae. For this reason, a fluoroquinolone-based regimen should be used for patients recently given a macrolide, and vice versa (Table 153-5). 1. Previously healthy and no antibiotics in past 3 months PO once, then 250 mg qd]) or 2. Comorbidities or antibiotics in past 3 months: select an alternative from a different class • A respiratory fluoroquinolone (moxifloxacin [400 mg PO qd], gemifloxacin [320 mg PO qd], levofloxacin [750 mg PO qd]) or • A β-lactam (preferred: high-dose amoxicillin [1 g tid] or amoxicillin/ clavulanate [2 g bid]; alternatives: ceftriaxone [1–2 g IV qd], cefpodoxime [200 mg PO bid], cefuroxime [500 mg PO bid]) plus a macrolidea 3. In regions with a high rate of “high-level” pneumococcal macrolide resistance,b consider alternatives listed above for patients with comorbidities.
Document 6 (Title: Caroli disease): Treatment The treatment depends on clinical features and the location of the biliary abnormality. When the disease is localized to one hepatic lobe, hepatectomy relieves symptoms and appears to remove the risk of malignancy. Good evidence suggests that malignancy complicates Caroli disease in roughly 7% of cases. Antibiotics are used to treat the inflammation of the bile duct, and ursodeoxycholic acid is used for hepatolithiasis. Ursodiol is given to treat cholelithiasis. In diffuse cases of Caroli disease, treatment options include conservative or endoscopic therapy, internal biliary bypass procedures, and liver transplantation in carefully selected cases. Surgical resection has been used successfully in patients with monolobar disease. An orthotopic liver transplant is another option, used only when antibiotics have no effect, in combination with recurring cholangitis. With a liver transplant, cholangiocarcinoma is usually avoided in the long run.
Document 7 (Title: Boutonneuse Fever -- Introduction): Treatment of BF is largely the same as for all rickettsial infections. Doxycycline is a tetracycline that remains useful in the management of obligately intracellular bacterial pathogens such as rickettsia. Patients with a more benign progression are treated with antibiotics for 7 days. Those with more progressive symptoms are usually treated for 14 days. Macrolides such as azithromycin are efficacious in children and pregnant women. [1] [2] [3]
Document 8 (Title: Emtricitabine -- Indications): Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has become the mainstay treatment for patients living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) emtricitabine is used in combination with other ART in the treatment of HIV-1, HIV-2, and hepatitis B virus (HBV). [1] Emtricitabine is FDA-approved for use in HIV treatment but is not FDA-approved for the treatment of HBV. [2] One study showed that emtricitabine at 200 mg helped patients achieve lower HBV DNA load and helped patients achieve normal ALT. [3] For pregnant women with concurrent HIV infection, ART should commence as soon as possible. [4] Options for ART available for pregnant women include the NRTI emtricitabine, along with abacavir, lamivudine, and tenofovir. [4] Early administration of ART in pregnancy reduces the risk of transmitting HIV to the infant. [4] Emtricitabine is a category B drug that does not cause teratogenesis or congenital abnormalities. [1] Emtricitabine safely treats patients with concurrent HIV and hepatitis C infection (HCV), as emtricitabine has few interactions with HCV medications. [4]
Document 9 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): In the initial regimen, it is necessary to use antibiotics active against both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria (Table 104-4). 2. Monotherapy with an aminoglycoside or an antibiotic lacking good activity against gram-positive organisms (e.g., ciprofloxacin or aztreonam) is not adequate in this setting. 3. The agents used should reflect both the epidemiology and the antibiotic resistance pattern of the hospital. 4. If the pattern of resistance justifies its use, a single third-generation cephalosporin constitutes an appropriate initial regimen in many hospitals. 5. Most standard regimens are designed for patients who have not previously received prophylactic antibiotics. The development of fever in a patient who has received antibiotics affects the choice of subsequent therapy, which should target resistant organisms and organisms known to cause infections in patients being treated with the antibiotics already administered. 6.
Document 10 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Because co-infection with C. trachomatis occurs frequently, initial treatment regimens must also incorporate an agent (e.g., azithromycin or doxycycline) that is effective against chlamydial infection. Pregnant women with gonorrhea, who should not take doxycycline, should receive concurrent treatment with a macrolide antibiotic for possible chlamydial infection. A single 1-g dose of azithromycin, which is effective therapy for uncomplicated chlamydial infections, results in an unacceptably low cure rate (93%) for gonococcal infections and should not be used alone. A single 2-g dose of azithromycin, particularly in the extended-release microsphere formulation, delivers azithromycin to the lower gastrointestinal tract, thereby improving tolerability. Azithromycin is effective against sensitive strains, but this drug is expensive, causes gastrointestinal distress, and is not recommended for routine or first-line treatment of gonorrhea. Spectinomycin has been used as an alternative agent
Document 11 (Title: Management options for Propionibacterium acnes endophthalmitis.): The authors reviewed the management of nine culture-proven cases of Propionibacterium acnes endophthalmitis which presented at an average of 4 months after extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE) and posterior chamber intraocular lens (PC IOL) implantation. The initial signs included a white intracapsular plaque (9/9), vitritis (9/9), granulomatous uveitis (4/9), nongranulomatous uveitis (5/9), hypopyon (4/9), beaded fibrin strands in the anterior chamber (3/9), and diffuse intraretinal hemorrhages (2/9). A variety of management schemes were used in these patients, including the following: topical and intravenous antibiotics alone; intraocular and topical antibiotic administration; pars plana vitrectomy with capsulectomy and intraocular antibiotic administration; and removal of all capsular remnants with PC IOL removal or exchange. The final visual acuities ranged from 20/20 to 20/60 in six eyes and 20/200 to 20/400 in three eyes. This review suggests that a variety of management options for P. acnes endophthalmitis appear to be successful. Based on the authors' experience, an algorithm for future treatment is offered.
Document 12 (Title: Macrolides -- Contraindications): Macrolides can exhibit adverse interactions with some commonly used drugs. Carbamazepine, cyclosporin, terfenadine, astemizole, and theophylline interactions are the most frequently encountered with macrolide antibiotics. As a CYP3A4 inhibitor, erythromycin is more prone to drug-drug interactions mediated by CYP3A4; clarithromycin is much less apt to interact in this manner azithromycin does not participate in these interactions. [16] Pregnant women should also try to avoid using macrolides, specifically erythromycin, due to possible side effects affecting the mother or the newborn. [17] Due to the increasing rate of antibiotic resistance, macrolides should be prescribed with caution, and the prescriber should take into account the local resistance status of common pathogens.
Document 13 (Title: Acne Vulgaris -- Treatment / Management -- Oral Antibiotics): Oral antibiotics effectively inhibit the growth of C acnes within the pilosebaceous unit. Tetracyclines, in particular, have anti-inflammatory properties, making them the preferred antibiotic for treating acne vulgaris. If tetracyclines are ineffective or not well-tolerated by patients, other antibiotics (such as macrolides, cephalosporins, penicillins, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) may be considered alternatives. [41] To reduce the development of antibiotic resistance, it is necessary to limit the duration of the treatment to the shortest possible period (ideally, 3-4 months). This can be complemented by the concurrent use of a topical retinoid, which can aid in the discontinuation of the antibiotic, or by incorporating the use of benzoyl peroxide. Preferred tetracyclines for acne treatment include doxycycline, minocycline, and sarecycline. Doxycycline and other tetracyclines should not be prescribed to patients who are children aged less than 8 or pregnant women. Long-term treatment with oral antibiotics may lead to tooth discoloration in developing teeth. Moreover, doxycycline can cause gastrointestinal distress, esophagitis, and pseudotumor cerebri (idiopathic intracranial hypertension). Photosensitivity is also one of the adverse effects of oral antibiotics; therefore, sun protective measures are advised while on treatment with tetracyclines.
Document 14 (Title: Gynecology_Novak): Expectant medical treatment consists of oral hydration or intravenous ﬂuids (if the patient is unable to tolerate oral intake), antibiotics for UTI, and pain control. Surgical management, such as lithotripsy or open surgery, is an option for renal and urethral lithiasis. Nonpregnant women (and pregnant women who are afebrile with a normal WBC count) with pyelonephritis and all women with cystitis can be treated on an outpatient basis. Nonpregnant women with pyelonephritis can be treated with a 14-day course of a ﬂuoroquinolone or trimethoprim/ sulfamethoxazole (some recommend one intravenous dose of a third-generation cephalosporin before discharging patients with oral antibiotics) (see Chapter 18) (32). Caution should be used with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole given rising resistance patterns. It is important to follow up urine culture sensitivities and treat accordingly. If there is no improvement, raising concerns for patient compliance, inability to tolerate oral medications and
Document 15 (Title: Macrolide): Macrolide antibiotics do so by binding reversibly to the P site on the 50S subunit of the bacterial ribosome. This action is considered to be bacteriostatic. Macrolides are actively concentrated within leukocytes, and thus are transported into the site of infection. Immunomodulation Diffuse panbronchiolitis The macrolide antibiotics erythromycin, clarithromycin, and roxithromycin have proven to be an effective long-term treatment for the idiopathic, Asian-prevalent lung disease diffuse panbronchiolitis (DPB). The successful results of macrolides in DPB stems from controlling symptoms through immunomodulation (adjusting the immune response), with the added benefit of low-dose requirements.
