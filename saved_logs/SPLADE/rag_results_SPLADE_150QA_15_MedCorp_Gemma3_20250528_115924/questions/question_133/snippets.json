It inhibits angiotensin I to angiotensin II conversion via competitive inhibition of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). [3] This inhibition disrupts the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Angiotensin II binds to AT1 receptors on smooth muscles to produce vasoconstriction and increased blood pressure. Additionally, angiotensin II\u00a0 stimulates the adrenal cortex to secrete aldosterone. Aldosterone causes the distal tubules and collecting ducts of the kidneys to reabsorb water and sodium in exchange\u00a0for potassium, which results in an expansion in extracellular volume and an increase in blood pressure. ACE inhibition leads to decreased plasma angiotensin II, leading to vasodilation and decreased aldosterone secretion. Angiotensin II also causes vasoconstriction of the afferent and efferent arterioles of the kidney, exerting a more significant effect on the efferent arterioles. Enalaprilat administration in the presence of hypovolemia can cause renal injury due to inadequate renal perfusion. [4] ACE breaks down bradykinin, a peptide that causes vasodilation.

        "content": "ANF is a peptide hormone with peripheral and central effects on several physiologic control systems, which suggests broad involvement in the regulation of intravascular volume and cardiovascular homeostasis. ANF acts directly on the kidney to modulate renal vascular resistance, increase glomerular filtration rate, and decrease inner medullary hypertonicity. These hemodynamic effects act in concert to promote marked natriuresis and diuresis and to inhibit renin secretion by the kidney; the potential role of direct effects on tubular transport and on the juxtaglomerular cells remains to be clarified. ANF also inhibits steroidogenesis, most prominently affecting agonist-induced aldosterone biosynthesis by the adrenal cortex. ANF exerts a smooth muscle relaxant effect on isolated vessels constricted with various hormonal agonists. ANF causes especially pronounced antagonism of the adrenal and vascular actions of angiotensin II and antagonizes the latter peptide's central nervous system effects. Although complex systemic hemodynamic mechanisms are involved, ANF-induced vasorelaxation may contribute to its depressor action, particularly in states characterized by angiotensin II-induced vasoconstriction. Distention of the atria is a major stimulus to ANF release and evokes many responses that are mimicked by ANF infusion. Although ANF is not the sole or even dominant mediator of the responses to atrial distention, available data suggest that it plays a role in the renal and hormonal responses to intravascular volume expansion. Definitive assessment of its physiologic and pathophysiologic significance must await development of specific antagonists, but further studies on the mechanisms of action of ANF at the molecular, cellular, and systemic levels are likely to contribute significantly to our understanding of the complex process of volume regulation and cardiovascular homeostasis.",

        "content": "The vascular endothelium plays an essential role in regulating the contractility of the adjacent smooth muscle cell through its secretory and metabolic properties. One of these well known properties is the conversion of angiotensin I into angiotensin II. But the endothelium also secretes at least three compounds able to diffuse to the smooth muscle cell and exerting a paracrine action: these are the prostacyclin (PGI2), the endothelium derived relaxing factor (EDRF) and the endothelin 1. The secretion of these different vasoactive compounds by endothelial cells is triggered by mechanical events, such as the shear stress, or by the effect of several humoral factors locally released, for example from platelets. The compound NO (nitric oxide) is produced by the endothelial enzyme NO synthase from its precursor L-arginine, and is responsible for the vasodilatory and antiplatelets properties of EDRF. NO, by activating the soluble guanylate cyclase in the smooth muscle cell, is responsible for the endothelium dependent vasodilatation. We observed in an isolated perfused rat kidney that the compound L-NAME (NG-monomethyl-L-arginine methyl ester), a competitive inhibitor of NO synthase blocking the production of NO, induces renal vasoconstriction and inhibits renin release. This suggests that not only the renal vasoconstriction but also the renal vasodilatation are active processes, permanently regulated by vasoactive compounds such as EDRF. It seems also that EDRF plays an important role in maintaining the secretion of renin. It can be hypothetized that an abnormality in the release or fate of EDRF might perhaps contribute to high blood pressure, by both a direct effect on the vascular tone and an indirect effect on the release of renin, which in turn regulates also the renal and systemic hemodynamics.",

Administration of graded concentrations of dopamine (5 X 10(-8) M to 10(-3) M) to interrenal slices induced a dose-dependent inhibition of steroid secretion. The half-maximal effective dose of dopamine was 7 X 10(-6) M for corticosterone and 4 X 10(-6) M for aldosterone. Noradrenaline and adrenaline were also able to elicit a dose-related inhibition of steroid release, but these catecholamines were approximately 100 and 2000 times less potent than dopamine in our model. Administration of repeated pulses of dopamine (5 X 10(-5) M), at 150-min intervals, led to a reproducible inhibition of corticosteroid secretion without any desensitization phenomenon. Similarly, prolonged infusion of dopamine (5 X 10(-6) M) caused a sustained inhibition of steroidogenesis. The inhibitory action of dopamine was also observed using enzymatically dispersed adrenal cells, indicating that dopamine exerts a direct effect on adrenocortical cells. After the second pulse, dopamine also induced a transient stimulation of steroid secretion from acutely dispersed cells. Administration of short pulses of apomorphine (5 X 10(-5) M) induced a transient inhibition of corticosteroid secretion, and the kinetics of the response were very similar to that observed with dopamine. During prolonged administration of dopamine, the steroidogenic actions of ACTH (10(-9) M) and serotonin (5 X 10(-6) M) were not altered. In contrast, dopamine induced a marked inhibition of angiotensin II-evoked corticosteroid secretion. Taken together, these results show that the neurotransmitter dopamine exerts a direct inhibitory effect on steroid secretion from frog adrenocortical cells.

        "content": "Mechanism of action Aliskiren is an antagonist to renin. Renin, the first enzyme in the renin\u2013angiotensin\u2013aldosterone system, plays a role in blood pressure control. It cleaves angiotensinogen to angiotensin I, which is in turn converted by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) to angiotensin II. Angiotensin II has both direct and indirect effects on blood pressure. It directly causes arterial smooth muscle to contract, leading to vasoconstriction and increased blood pressure. Angiotensin II also stimulates the production of aldosterone from the adrenal cortex, which causes the tubules of the kidneys to increase reabsorption of sodium, with water following, thereby increasing plasma volume, and thus blood pressure. Aliskiren binds to the S3bp binding site of renin, essential for its activity. Binding to this pocket prevents the conversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I. Aliskiren is also available as combination therapy with hydrochlorothiazide.",
