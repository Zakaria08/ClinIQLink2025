Document 1 (Title: Isosorbide -- Indications -- FDA Approved Indications for Isosorbide Dinitrate): Prevention or treatment of angina pectoris resulting from coronary artery disease - however, it is not recommended for use once the anginal episode has started because the onset of action is not sufficiently rapid enough to abort an acute anginal event. In the latter case, glyceryl trinitrate is preferable. Treatment of congestive heart failure. A fixed-dose combination of isosorbide dinitrate and hydralazine is approved to treat congestive heart failure in African Americans. [2]
Document 2 (Title: Antianginal and anti-ischemic efficacy of nicorandil compared with nifedipine in patients with angina pectoris and coronary heart disease: a double-blind, randomized, multicenter study.): Patients with stable, effort-induced angina pectoris and a typical combination of anginal pain and ischemic ST depression in exercise tolerance tests were randomized to treatment for 8 weeks with nicorandil (a newly developed antianginal and anti-ischemic drug) or nifedipine. After 4 weeks, the dosage of nicorandil was increased from 10 mg b.i.d. to 20 mg b.i.d., but the recommended dosage of nifedipine, 20 mg b.i.d., was kept constant during the study period. Double-blind treatment was preceded by a 2-week prephase during which patients were treated with isosorbide dinitrate. During the study period, patients were asked to report the rate of anginal attacks and consumption of sublingual nitroglycerin. Measurements of blood pressure and heart rate at rest and during exercise always were performed 2 h after drug intake. Fifty-eight patients were randomized--29 to nicorandil and 29 to nifedipine. There were large individual variations in anginal attack rates, which makes group comparisons difficult, but in the nicorandil group, the anginal attack rate decreased significantly compared with baseline frequency. Systolic blood pressure at rest was reduced significantly only with the highest dose of nicorandil, but nifedipine had a significant effect on both systolic and diastolic blood pressures as well as on the heart rate. Both treatments significantly increased exercise duration, time to onset of angina pectoris, and time to 1-mm ST depression. In the nicorandil group, an improvement was noted with the 20-mg dose compared with the 10-mg dose, but no significant differences were noted between the nicorandil and nifedipine groups after either 4 or 8 weeks of treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Document 3 (Title: Biochemistry_Lippinco): .5. A 67-year-old man presented to the emergency department with a 1-week history of angina and shortness of breath. He complained that his face and extremities had taken on a blue color. His medical history included chronic stable angina treated with isosorbide dinitrate and nitroglycerin. Blood obtained for analysis was brown. Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis? A. Carboxyhemoglobinemia B. Hemoglobin SC disease C. Methemoglobinemia D. Sickle cell anemia E. β-Thalassemia
Document 4 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Disease-modifying therapies have not been rigorously studied in NMO. Acute attacks of NMO are usually treated with high-dose glucocorticoids (solumedrol 1–2 g/d for 5–10 days followed by a prednisone taper). Plasma exchange (typically 7 qod exchanges of 1.5 plasma volumes) has also been used empirically for acute episodes that fail to respond to glucocorticoids. Given the unfavorable natural history of untreated NMO, prophylaxis against relapses is recommended for most patients using one of the following regimens: mycophenylate mofetil (250 mg bid gradually increasing to 1000 mg bid); B cell depletion with anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (rituximab); or a combination of glucocorticoids (500 mg IV methylprednisolone daily for 5 days; then oral prednisone 1 mg/kg per day for 2 months, followed by slow taper) plus azathioprine (2 mg/kg per day started on week 3). Available evidence suggests that use of IFN-β is ineffective and paradoxically may increase the risk of NMO relapses.
Document 5 (Title: Antianginal): An antianginal is a drug used in the treatment of angina pectoris, a symptom of ischaemic heart disease. Examples Drugs used are nitrates, beta blockers, or calcium channel blockers. Nitrates Nitrates cause vasodilation of the venous capacitance vessels by stimulating the endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF). Used to relieve both exertional and vasospastic angina by allowing venous pooling, reducing the pressure in the ventricles and so reducing wall tension and oxygen requirements in, the heart. Short-acting nitrates are used to abort angina attacks that have occurred, while longer-acting nitrates are used in the prophylactic management of the condition. Agents include glyceryl trinitrate (GTN), pentaerythritol tetranitrate, isosorbide dinitrate and isosorbide mononitrate. Beta blockers Beta blockers are used in the prophylaxis of exertional angina by reducing the myocardial oxygen demand below the level that would provoke an angina attack.
Document 6 (Title: Role of nitrates in angina pectoris.): Nitrates are used extensively for the treatment of angina pectoris. However, continuous therapy with either oral nitrates or nitroglycerin patches leads to rapid development of tolerance, with loss or diminution of antianginal and anti-ischemic effects. The only practical way to avoid the development of tolerance is to use intermittent daily therapy with nitrates. Nitroglycerin patches applied for 10-12 hours during the day increase exercise duration for 8-12 hours, but a rebound increase in anginal attacks during the nitrate-free interval may occur. Oral isosorbide-5-mononitrate, 20 mg twice a day, with the first dose administered in the morning and the second dose 7 hours later, increases exercise duration for at least 12 hours without the development of tolerance to either the morning or afternoon dose. This dosing regimen has been shown not to produce a rebound phenomenon during the periods of low nitrate levels at night and early hours of the morning. Isosorbide dinitrate (30 mg) prescribed at 7 AM and 1 PM does not produce tolerance to the 7 AM dose, but effects of the afternoon dose have not been evaluated. Recent data suggest that isosorbide dinitrate given 3 or 4 times daily produces tolerance and this dosing schedule is inadequate for antianginal prophylaxis. It should be recognized that intermittent oral or patch therapy with nitrates during the day leaves the patient unprotected at night and early hours of the morning. If this is of concern, additional therapy with another class of antianginal agent, preferably a long-acting beta blocker or a long-acting calcium antagonist should be instituted.

Document 8 (Title: EMS Pain Assessment And Management -- Issues of Concern -- Pain Management): Non-opiate pain medication is considered one of the first-line treatment options for acute pain for non-healthcare individuals. The (2) primary classes include aniline analgesics and non-steroid anti-inflammatories. The primary mechanism of action for both NSAIDs and acetaminophen (which is a non-opiate analgesic) is by the reduction of prostaglandins in the brain by reducing cyclooxygenase (COX inhibitors). Additional non-opiate analgesic medications include nitroglycerin. Aniline analgesics are a class of medications first produced in 1886, with acetanilide being the first drug of this class with its major metabolite being paracetamol, but its use was stopped because of cyanosis due to methemoglobinemia. Phenacetin (synthesized by Bayer in 1887) and paracetamol (synthesized at Johns Hopkins University in 1887) are additional aniline derivatives. Phenacetin gained faster acceptance over paracetamol because the original thinking was that paracetamol to produced methemoglobinemia, but in the 1940s, research disproved this and determined that phenacetin metabolized to paracetamol. In the 1980s, phenacetin was banned secondary to hematological toxicity, analgesic nephropathy, and abuse due to psychotropic effects. Acetaminophen (para-acetylaminophenol or NPAP) First created in 1887 and has been one of the most commonly used pain and fever-reducing medications in the Americas and Europe. It has been listed by the World Health Organization (WHO) as an essential medication and is deemed safe in pregnancy. It has many medical uses, including fever reduction, mild to moderate pain management, and has been combined with opioids to improve analgesic effects. Adverse effects include liver damage (either in acute overdoses or with chronic use) via the toxic intermediate product NAPQI (N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine) and recent FDA warning about rare development of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Mechanism of action is with COX-2 inhibition and within the hypothalamus to produce antipyresis. Para-acetylaminophenol breaks down into three separate metabolites via different processes that include: (1) glucuronidation, (2) sulfation, and (3) N-hydroxylation by cytochrome P-450.  NAPQI is the toxic metabolite produced during the N-hydroxylation process and reacts to sulfhydryl groups of glutathione to produce harmless metabolites.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) break down into either COX-1 and COX-2 inhibitors, with both isozymes having a similar mechanism of action of inhibiting the breakdown of arachidonic acid with downstream reduction of prostaglandins, thromboxane, and prostacyclin. [24] This class of medication, when not contraindicated, can be used separately as being favored over acetaminophen (paracetamol) due to the anti-inflammatory properties or in conjunction with acetaminophen (paracetamol) with synergistic effects.

The first described use for nitroglycerin in medicine dates back to 1867, when Lauder Brunton treated patients with angina. Today nitroglycerin is on the World Health Organization's list of essential medications. [26] Nitroglycerin causes smooth muscle dilation by decreasing the cytosolic calcium levels. This process occurs through the release of nitrous oxide that stimulates the conversion of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) to cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), which acts as a cellular messenger. cGMP stimulates protein kinase P, a second messenger that causes a drop in the cytosolic calcium and smooth muscle dilation.

Document 9 (Title: Nitroglycerin (medication)): GTN is useful in decreasing angina attacks, perhaps more so than reversing angina once started, by supplementing blood concentrations of NO, also called endothelium-derived relaxing factor, before the structure of NO as the responsible agent was known. This led to the development of transdermal patches of glyceryl trinitrate, providing 24-hour release. However, the effectiveness of glyceryl trinitrate is limited by development of tolerance/tachyphylaxis within 2–3 weeks of sustained use. Continuous administration and absorption (such as provided by daily pills and especially skin patches) accelerate onset of tolerance and limit the usefulness of the agent. Thus, glyceryl trinitrate works best when used only in short-term, pulse dosing. Glyceryl trinitrate is useful for myocardial infarction (heart attack) and pulmonary edema, again working best if used quickly, within a few minutes of symptom onset, as a pulse dose. It may also be given as a sublingual or buccal dose in the form of a
Document 10 (Title: Nitroglycerin): transmural pressure (pressure exerted on the walls of the heart), which decreases the compression of heart arteries to allow more blood to flow through the heart. At higher doses, it also dilates arteries, thereby reducing afterload (decreasing the pressure against which the heart must pump). An improved ratio of myocardial oxygen demand to supply leads to the following therapeutic effects during episodes of angina pectoris: subsiding of chest pain, decrease of blood pressure, increase of heart rate, and orthostatic hypotension. Patients experiencing angina when doing certain physical activities can often prevent symptoms by taking nitroglycerin 5 to 10 minutes before the activity. Overdoses may generate methemoglobinemia.
Document 11 (Title: Nitroglycerin): Dynamite mixtures containing nitrocellulose, which increases the viscosity of the mix, are commonly known as "gelatins". Following the discovery that amyl nitrite helped alleviate chest pain, the physician William Murrell experimented with the use of nitroglycerin to alleviate angina pectoris and to reduce the blood pressure. He began treating his patients with small diluted doses of nitroglycerin in 1878, and this treatment was soon adopted into widespread use after Murrell published his results in the journal The Lancet in 1879. A few months before his death in 1896, Alfred Nobel was prescribed nitroglycerin for this heart condition, writing to a friend: "Isn't it the irony of fate that I have been prescribed nitro-glycerin, to be taken internally! They call it Trinitrin, so as not to scare the chemist and the public." The medical establishment also used the name "glyceryl trinitrate" for the same reason.
Document 12 (Title: Anti-anginal efficacy of a controlled-release formulation of isosorbide-5-mononitrate once daily in angina patients on chronic beta-blockade.): The anti-anginal effect of a controlled-release (Durules) formulation of isosorbide-5-mononitrate (5-ISMN) 60 mg, Imdur, once daily was evaluated in a randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study with a placebo run-in period. Each period lasted for 2 weeks. A total of 70 patients (58 men and 12 women) with stable exertional angina pectoris on beta-blockade, mean age 59 years (range 39-71), were included. Exercise testing was performed on a bicycle ergometer 3 hours after the dose at the end of each period. Anginal attacks and intake of sublingual nitroglycerin tablets were noted. Imdur in combination with a beta-blocker significantly increased the total exercise capacity, the time and total work until the onset of chest pain and at 1 mm ST-depression compared with beta-blockade alone. The attack rate and the nitroglycerin consumption were significantly decreased. Headache was the only significant side-effect. In conclusion, the addition of Imdur once daily to beta-blockade significantly increased the anti-anginal effect.
Document 13 (Title: Nitroglycerin -- Indications): Nitroglycerin is a vasodilatory drug used primarily to provide relief from anginal chest pain. Nitroglycerin has been FDA approved since 2000 and was first sold as a brand-name agent. It is currently FDA approved for the acute relief of an attack or acute prophylaxis of angina pectoris secondary to coronary artery disease. Off-label, non-FDA-approved uses include treatment for hypertensive urgency/emergency, coronary artery spasm, angina secondary to cocaine use, congestive heart failure (CHF), and chronic anal fissures. Along with hydralazine as a combination therapy, it is also indicated in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection in whom ACE inhibitors are contraindicated. Nitroglycerin is occasionally given to reduce radial spasms during coronary angiography through the radial approach.  Nitroglycerin was first used in 1879 as a treatment for angina and since it has been part of management to relieve anginal chest pain.

Document 14 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): Clinical Use of Nitrates Some of the forms of nitroglycerin and its congeners and their doses are listed in Table 12–3. Because of its rapid onset of action (1–3 minutes), sublingual nitroglycerin is the most frequently used agent for the immediate treatment of angina. Because its duration of action is short (not exceeding 20–30 minutes), it is not suitable for maintenance therapy. The onset of action of intravenous nitroglycerin is also rapid (minutes), but its hemodynamic TABLE 12–3 Nitrate and nitrite drugs used in the treatment of angina. effects are quickly reversed when the infusion is stopped. Clinical use of intravenous nitroglycerin is therefore restricted to the treatment of severe, recurrent rest angina. Slowly absorbed preparations of nitroglycerin include a buccal form, oral preparations, and several transdermal forms. These formulations have been shown to provide blood concentrations for long periods but, as noted above, this leads to the development of tolerance.
Document 15 (Title: Nitrates -- Administration): Nitrates have many different forms with various routes of administration. [3] Nitroglycerin, also known as glyceryl trinitrate (GTN), can be administered as a patch, ointment, capsule, spray, intravenous infusion, or a sublingual tablet. [3] Sublingual nitroglycerin is the therapy of choice for acute anginal episodes since it avoids first-pass metabolism, allowing for immediate and short anginal relief. [3] Transdermal, ointment, and spray are other options with similar efficacy but are less popular. [3] The capsule form of nitroglycerin has a longer duration of action and require larger doses. Intravenous nitroglycerin is useful for hypertensive emergencies. [2] [3]
