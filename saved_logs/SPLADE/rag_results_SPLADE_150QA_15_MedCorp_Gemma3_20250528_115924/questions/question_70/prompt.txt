Document 1 (Title: Disaster medicine): Medical contingency planning – The act of devising a methodology for meeting the medical requirements of a population affected by a disaster event. Medical surge – An influx of patients (physical casualties and psychological casualties), bystanders, visitors, family members, media and individuals searching for the missing who present to a hospital or healthcare facility for treatment, information and/or shelter as a result of a disaster. Surge capacity – The ability to manage a sudden, unexpected increase in patient volume that would otherwise severely challenge or exceed the current capacity of the health care system. Medical triage – The separation of patients based on severity of injury or illness in light of available resources. Psychosocial triage – The separation of patients based on the severity of psychological injury or impact in light of available resources.
Document 2 (Title: Modern war surgery: operations in an evacuation hospital during the October 1973 Arab-Israeli war.): A forward evacuation hospital functioned in the southern front in October 1973 Israeli-Arab War as an intermediate unit in the Israeli casualty management logistics. Casualties were characterized by frequent multiple-system injuries and variable combinations of penetrating wounds, blunt trauma, burns, and inhalation injury, with an increased incidence of associated blunt trauma. As the result of the systems organization, the EH was able to provide the wounded with early intensive and definitive resuscitation therapy which permitted further evacuation of the casualties to the central hospitals in a better state of physiological stability. In the most critically wounded when there was imminent threat to survival, operations were performed at the EH as an integral part of the resuscitation process. Performance of operations in a forward evacuation hospital did not increase the number or severity of postoperative complications. Morbidity and mortality were related to the nature and magnitude of injury.
Document 3 (Title: Emergency Preparedness -- Definition/Introduction): External disasters occur at locations separate from the hospital, such as transportation incidents or industrial accidents. Disasters can be both internal and external disasters concomitantly, such as natural disasters that cause mass casualties as well as damage hospital structure. Disasters can be acute or ongoing. Acute disasters have a general time of onset of the time of an event occurring. Acute disasters have a typical patient flow, which produces numerous low acuity patients presenting to the hospital, overwhelming the surge capacity, or the number of patients the facility can care for presenting at a single time. This surge event is followed by the majority of patients presenting by personal transport and later EMS or prehospital transport of the critically ill. Peak volumes in acute disasters are expected at two to three hours post-event. Evolving disasters such as infectious pandemics have a gradual progression to critical populations, but volumes and resource strain remain for extended periods. Disaster types can further subdivide into categories such as natural disasters, chemical disasters, and bioterrorism; each subdivision produces a specific injury or exposure profile and individual strain on resources that can guide emergency preparedness planning and response.

Document 5 (Title: EMS Terrorism Response -- Clinical Significance): Command, control, and communication require emphasis. EMS, as well as hospital administrators, should be included as it is essential to anticipate surge capacity. The inclusion of all local hospitals is vital in contingency plans as the number of severely injured patients may become overwhelming even for a level 1 trauma center. [18]
Document 6 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): use of the available clinical services and facilities. Triage requires determination of the level of emergency care needed. The higher the number and broader the range of casualties, the more complex and difficult triage becomes. The mildly wounded and victims of contamination only can be sent to evacuation, registration (with disaster response teams), and decontamination/treatment centers. Figure 263e-2 illustrates an evacuation scheme after a radiologic event causing multiple casualties. The goal of such an algorithm is to treat all possible victims of exposure and minor injury outside of the hospital setting. This approach prevents hospitals from being directly overwhelmed and enhances treatment for persons who are severely wounded. Emergency treatment should be administered initially for conventional injuries such as wounds, trauma, and thermal or chemical burns. Individuals with such injuries should be stabilized, if possible, and immediately transported to a medical facility.
Document 7 (Title: An argument for equipping civilian hospitals with a multiple respirator system for a chemical warfare mass casualty situation.): During the Persian Gulf war, the entire Israeli population was under the threat of chemical missiles. One of the main effects of chemical agents (e.g., organophosphorus) is respiratory distress, which requires treatment with mechanical ventilation and oxygen enrichment. In the event of a chemical missile attack, the civilian hospitals may enter a state of insufficiency for treating such victims due to the limited amount of equipment, staff and oxygen/air sources. A possible technological solution is a multiple respirator system (MRS) with a multiple oxygen enrichment system designed for use in the battlefield. The advantages of these technologies in the civilian hospital setting during a chemical mass casualty situation are: (a) rapid deployment, (b) high transportability, (c) capability of operation in any location, (d) modularity, and (e) less medical staff for operation. Two types of MRS are described and issues concerning their selection are discussed. The authorities responsible for national health policy may wish to adopt and incorporate these technologies into their hospital and emergency services preparedness system.
Document 8 (Title: Obstentrics_Williams): he incidence of stone disease complicating pregnancy varies. At the low end, the incidence was 0.3 admissions per 1000 pregnancies at Parkland Hospital (Butler, 2000). In an Israeli study, the incidence in nearly 220,000 pregnancies was 0.8 per 1000 (Rosenberg, 2011). In Washington state, the incidence was 1.7 per 1000 pregnancies (Swartz, 2007). Bladder stones are rare, but recurrent infection and labor obstructed by stones have been reported (Ait Benkaddour, 2006; Ruan, 2011).
Document 9 (Title: EMS Reverse Triage -- Issues of Concern): In healthcare systems across the country, there are periods when demand for healthcare services spike to levels above the baseline level of demand. These “surge” periods of demand place stress on the healthcare system, especially those areas with already scant resources. Each system can handle surge demand to different degrees based on the availability of resources and ability to maximize their effectiveness. Surge capacity is the maximum amount of resources that can potentially be available during a given period. [2] Hospitals normally operate at a baseline capacity, but can rapidly increase this capacity by increasing the number of resources available or by changing management of available resources. Common ways hospitals currently increase capacity include calling in additional staff, opening “pop-up” inpatient units, and canceling elective surgeries or admissions. In times of extreme resource demand, as in mass casualty incidents or disasters, even these normal capacity enhancing techniques can quickly be overwhelmed. Most healthcare systems implement triage systems to detect which patients are the most critical and will potentially require the most resources. Reverse triage (in this situation) is a method to redistribute resources to those patients who need them most by identifying the least critical patients who require the least amount of resources. [1]

Document 13 (Title: Managing mass casualties in Israel.): The author relates her experiences as an observer at an Israeli mass casualty simulated exercise in a general hospital. Israeli people, who have seen their country engaged in several major wars over the last 40 years and who live with the potential for terrorist atrocity as a daily threat, treat such exercises with great seriousness. The scale and realistic nature of the exercise was impressive, and while such activities may not be directly translatable to a British situation, the energy, commitment and systematic approach of the Israeli personnel are qualities which British hospital and military staff could adopt.
Document 14 (Title: EMS Reverse Triage -- Issues of Concern): Techniques to address surging healthcare demand are an ongoing area of research as hospital systems across the country are facing increased demand with a limited supply of resources. Although reverse triage has been proposed as a tool to combat a surge in a mass casualty or disaster event, several hospitals are evaluating the feasibility of using the reverse triage system to address more routine surge situations such as emergency department overcrowding. [2] This is an undesirable application of this tool, as it fails to address the underlying root cause of the problem, which is inpatient hospital bed availability. Reverse triage is meant to combat a singular overwhelming event that is unlikely to re-occur on a reasonable time line, so it is self-limiting by design. Although the reverse triage system could be applied in much the same way to daily boarding and poor hospital flow planning, the level of risk that is acceptable for a discharged patient will be much lower in the normal day to day operations of a hospital system when compared to extreme events. [2] As the tolerable level of risk decreases, the magnitude of the effect of reverse triage will also decrease. Each hospital must decide which level of risk is acceptable in each situation and determine whether the increase in capacity justifies the increased risk.
Document 15 (Title: Psychiatric implications of missile attacks on a civilian population. Israeli lessons from the Persian Gulf War.): To determine the proportion of hospitalized patients who had stress reactions as a result of missile attacks during the Persian Gulf War and evaluate the factors that influenced their evacuation. Review of medical records of patients hospitalized as a result of missile attacks. During the Persian Gulf War in the winter of 1991, Israel received 18 missile attacks involving 39 surface-to-surface Scud missiles. The uncertainty in time, place, and type of warhead, conventional or chemical, was a source of chronic stress and the immediate cause for many traumatic stress reactions at or near the missile attack sites. Data from victims who were injured after each missile attack were available through a central hookup between 12 local hospitals and the Medical Corps of the Israeli Defence Force. The number of persons diagnosed in the hospital as psychological casualties after each missile attack. Approximately 43% of the 773 casualties evacuated to hospitals were diagnosed as psychological casualties, and an additional 27% had mistakenly injected themselves with atropine. Data also indicated that triage of psychological casualties to hospitals was more a function of the rescue team's training and preparation than the severity or extent of injury or damage. Optimal treatment during events that cause mass casualties requires proper preparation of rescue teams as well as reorganization of the hospital's psychiatric services. The threat of chemical warfare affected the number and nature of stress reactions.
