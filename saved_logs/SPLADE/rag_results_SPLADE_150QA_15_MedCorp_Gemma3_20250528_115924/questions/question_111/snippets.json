        "content": "Receptor tyrosine kinases couple to multiple intracellular effector molecules that are crucial for normal cell growth and transformation. Stimulation of membrane phospholipid hydrolysis by receptor tyrosine kinases is one such pathway for generating intracellular second messengers that may be important for mitogenesis. Certain receptor tyrosine kinases tyrosine phosphorylate a phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C that hydrolyses the membrane phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. In contrast, the glycoprotein receptor for colony stimulating factor 1, a transmembrane tyrosine kinase, does not utilize this pathway, but rather stimulates the hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine. Here we show that eluates of antiphosphotyrosine affinity purified lysates of colony-stimulating factor 1-stimulated cells contain elevated levels of phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C activity. The affinity-purified activity is sensitive to tyrosine-specific T-cell phosphatase, and is detected in the membrane fraction of stimulated cells. Recovery of phospholipase C activity in the antiphosphotyrosine protein fraction is reduced by pertussis toxin pretreatment of cells. The phosphatidylcholine phospholipase C activity in isolated membranes of colony-stimulating factor 1-treated cells was also reduced by pertussis toxin treatment and stimulated by guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate. These results indicate that colony stimulating factor 1 receptor-mediated stimulation of phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C requires tyrosine phosphorylation, and might be affected by a G-protein coupled pathway.",

        "content": "Ligation of the Ag receptor on B cells is associated with a rapid increase in phosphorylation on tyrosine residues of multiple substrates. One of the substrates is the phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C-gamma 1. Because activation of phospholipase C-gamma 1 seems to be dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation, it is assumed that the two signaling pathways, phosphatidylinositol turnover and tyrosine phosphorylation, might be linked. However, since the Ag receptor does not possess a kinase domain, it remains unclear how these signaling pathways are regulated by the Ag receptor. Previous studies have proposed the existence of a receptor-coupled G protein that regulates inositol phosphate production in B cells. We confirm that phosphoinositide turnover is regulated by a pertussis toxin (PT)-sensitive G protein, most probably by controlling phosphorylation of phospholipase C-gamma 1. We show that treatment of permeabilized B cells with a nonhydrolyzable GTP analogue guanosine 5'-[3-thio]triphosphate induced an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple substrates that are identical to the proteins phosphorylated after anti-IgM stimulation. Furthermore, binding of the inactive form of G proteins with guanosine 5'-[2-thio]-triphosphate blocked anti-IgM induced tyrosine phosphorylation in permeabilized B cells. The results indicate that an Ag receptor-coupled G protein controls protein tyrosine kinase activity. We show that this G protein is sensitive to PT because tyrosine phosphorylation mediated by the Ag receptor was inhibited by this toxin in a concentration-dependent manner. Similar concentrations of PT also blocked tyrosine phosphorylation on phospholipase C-gamma 1 and generation of inositol phosphates. Preincubation of intact B cells with PT resulted in inhibition of c-fos mRNA expression and DNA synthesis in anti-IgM stimulated B cells, indicating that post-transcriptional events are also controlled by the Ag-receptor coupled G protein. We conclude that Ag receptor-associated protein tyrosine kinase activity is regulated by a G protein. This PT-sensitive G protein also regulates phosphorylation and activation of phospholipase C-gamma 1 as well as later events in B cell activation such as c-fos mRNA expression and proliferation.",

The growth factors maintain the critical vitality of the cells by stimulating adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis and hexose transport. Intracellular alkalinization also occurs rapidly through the stimulation of the Na+/H+ antiporter. These immediate metabolic events, not initiated by serum components, appear to be necessary for the integrity of cellular viability (Fig. 6). Interleukin-3 has been shown to induce the activation of PK-C through a mechanism(s) not requiring the hydrolysis of phosphoinositol 4,5 bisphosphate. A role for Ca2+ influx or intracellular release in the action of CSFs or interleukins has not been shown. Although downregulation of cAMP has been reported in response to IL-2, the signal transduction process of CSFs and IL-2 appears not to be mediated by upregulation of cyclic nucleotide metabolism or \"classical\" phospholipid degradative pathways. Protein phosphorylation is clearly modulated by the hemopoietic cytokines, yet only the CSF-1 receptor has any known intrinsic kinase activity. Instead, the IL-3, GM-CSF receptors, and perhaps G-CSF appear to be coupling to kinases of both tyrosine and serine specificities. This may be a direct allosteric interaction with membrane-associated kinases or transduced through an intermediate protein such as those using GTP. Such is the case for many hormone receptors that couple to amplifying \"second messenger\" enzyme systems (i.e., adenylate cyclase, phospholipase C) or members of the insulin growth factor family that couple to tyrosine kinases in proximity to the receptors (IGF-II). One of the kinase systems that IL-2, IL-3, and other CSFs stimulate appears to have some characteristics similar to PK-C. Direct activators of PK-C stimulate some similar serine-threonine phosphorylation and perhaps even tyrosine phosphorylation. The hemopoietic growth factors, however, stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of some proteins that are not phosphorylated in response to PK-C activators, suggesting that these kinase systems are independently regulated. Although phorbol esters stimulate many of the same metabolic activities (ATP synthesis in myeloid and lymphoid cell lines), growth-factor abrogation is clearly associated with the action of tyrosine kinase oncogenes or the nuclear oncogene effectors such as v-myc. It is likely, therefore, that tyrosine kinases are playing a critical role in the control of proliferation although the dominant amount of cellular protein phosphorylations are on serine.

The latter signaling pathway has been suggested as an intracellular signaling mechanism for the development of schizophrenia, bipolar disorders, and other behavioral changes involved in dopamine receptor activity.",

        "content": "IP3 channels are consist of four subunits that make up a tetrameric channel embedded in the membrane of the endoplasmic and sarcoplasmic reticulum. [29] The IP3R monomers have a binding pocket, a regulatory domain in the cytosol, and a pore region. The pore region is composed of a six-transmembrane spanning helix located near the C-terminus through which calcium flows. The ligand-binding pocket is located near the N-terminal and binds to IP3. [10] An essential aspect of these channels is the various scaffolding and cytoskeletal proteins it associates with to form macromolecular complexes with other receptors and provide stability. Furthermore, various adaptor proteins link the IP3 receptor to different other molecules in the cell. [30] Finally, various calcium-binding proteins also have binding sites on the channel to modulate their function. [30] Its ligand-binding site for inositol triphosphate (IP3) is located near the N-terminal of the protein. [31] The ligand-binding site must be occupied on all four monomers by IP3 to induce the necessary conformational change that sensitizes the channel to calcium. [29] Once the channel undergoes this conformational change and calcium has bound to its binding site, the channel opens. Calcium then passes through from the ER or SR to the cytoplasm. This sequence of events often follows the activation of another receptor, such as a G-protein-coupled receptor or receptor tyrosine kinase on the plasma membrane to which the IP3 receptor couples. These cell surface receptors activate an intracellular signaling pathway that leads to the activation of phospholipase C (PLC), which produces IP3 as one of its end-products.",

        "content": "TSH binds and activates the thyroid gland. The TSH binds to the membrane receptor on the epithelial cell surface, activating the adenylate cyclase located in the plasma membrane, which increases the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels. This leads to the stimulation of additional intracellular signaling events, resulting in the formation of thyroid hormones. [9] Iodide from the plasma is concentrated and absorbed by thyroid cells through the sodium/iodide symporter (NIS) on the basolateral membrane of thyrocytes (follicular cells). This process depends on sodium and active transport, meaning it couples inward translocation down its electrochemical gradient with inward translocation of iodide against its electrochemical gradient. The iodide has to be delivered to the thyroglobulin-enriched colloid at the apical surface; this appears to be a function of another protein, pendrin, which is a chloride/iodide exchanger that promotes iodide efflux in the colloid-rich lumen. Within the thyroid follicle, thyroid peroxidase oxidizes, organifies, and couples iodine to tyrosine residues on thyroglobulin. Defects in any of these steps can result in dyshormonogenetic goiter\u00a0and congenital hypothyroidism. Thyroglobulin is a glycoprotein with a molecular mass of 660 kDa enriched in tyrosine residues and secreted and stored in the colloid. Initially, thyroid peroxidase forms iodine by oxidation of the iodide ion. When TSH stimulates the thyroid follicle, thyroid peroxidase organifies or covalently bonds the tyrosine of the thyroglobulin molecule to colloid to iodine. If\u00a01 iodine covalently bonds to tyrosine on the thyroglobulin, this forms monoiodotyrosine (MIT). If\u00a02 iodine covalently bonds thyroglobulin, this forms diiodotyrosine (DIT). Thyroid peroxidase then couples an MIT with a DIT to form triiodothyronine (T3) or couples a molecule of DIT with another DIT to form thyroxine (T4). After the coupling,\u00a0thyroglobulin is taken up by the thyrocyte for lysosomal degradation, releasing T4 and T3. DIT and MIT that are uncoupled are deiodinated by a dehalogenase to recycle and conserve any iodide. The thyroid gland secretes thyroxine (T4), which can convert to T3 in the periphery or reverse T3 (rT3). Triiodothyronine (T3) is active, whereas rT3 is inactive. [10]",
