Document 1 (Title: Multistrategy health education program to increase mammography use among women ages 65 and older.): Mammography use decreases with age although the risk of breast cancer increases with age. Medicare now provides biennial coverage for screening mammography. This study was designed to simulate the Medicare condition by subsidizing mammography among women in eight retirement communities in the metropolitan Philadelphia area. The study also measured the impact of health education interventions and the presence of a mobile mammography van on increased use of mammography. Retirement communities were assigned randomly to the control (cost subsidy alone) or experimental group (cost subsidy, mammography van, and tailored health education interventions). A total of 412 women ages 65 and older who had not had mammograms in the previous year were surveyed at baseline and 3 months later. Analytic techniques reflected the cluster nature of the randomization. Women in the experimental group were significantly more likely than the control group women to have obtained mammograms. Forty-five percent of the experimental group women compared with 12 percent of the control group women subsequently had mammograms in the 3 months after the baseline interview (P less than .001). Logistic regression analysis for mammography use indicated an odds ratio of 6.1 associated with being in the experimental group. For women in the experimental group, a separate logistic regression for mammography use showed an odds ratio of 7.8 associated with attendance at the educational presentation. The results suggest that Medicare coverage alone will not increase mammography use sufficiently to achieve year 2000 objectives. However, the addition of access enhancing and health education interventions boosts utilization dramatically.
Document 2 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): In addition to addressing the negative impact of smoking on fertility and pregnancy outcome, counseling about nutrition and weight is a fundamental component of infertility and pregnancy management. Both low and increased body mass index (BMI) are associated with infertility in women and with increased morbidity during pregnancy. Obesity has also been associated with infertility in men. The treatment of infertility should be tailored to the problems unique to each couple. In many situations, including unexplained infertility, mild-to-moderate endometriosis, and/or borderline semen parameters, a stepwise approach to infertility is optimal, beginning with low-risk interventions and moving to more invasive, higher risk interventions only if necessary. After determination of all infertility factors and their correction, if possible, this approach might include, in increasing order of complexity: (1) expectant management, (2) clomiphene citrate or an aromatase inhibitor (see below) with or
Document 3 (Title: Noise-induced hearing loss): A systematic review of the effectiveness of interventions to promote the use of hearing protection devices such as earplugs and earmuffs among workers found that tailored interventions improve the average use of such devices when compared with no intervention. Tailored interventions involve the use of communication or other types of interventions that are specific to an individual or a group and aim to change behavior. Mixed interventions such as mailings, distribution of hearing protection devices, noise assessments, and hearing testing are also more effective in improving the use of hearing protection devices compared with hearing testing alone. Programs that increased the proportion of workers wearing hearing protection equipment did reduce overall hearing loss. Hearing conservation programs
Document 4 (Title: Health Maintenance Organization -- Nursing, Allied Health, and Interprofessional Team Interventions): HMOs are a type of managed care designed to maintain the health of their patients cost-effectively. A primary method HMOs use to achieve these goals is to coordinate health services and care provided to patients. [15] Such care coordination requires collaboration among various members of the care team. Multiple strategies have sought to attempt to improve care coordination in managed care organizations such as HMOs. For example, explicitly defining the responsibility of each member of the care team is thought to improve coordination among members. [16] Financial risk-sharing strategies, such as bundled payments and capitated payments, shared among different care team members, can also incentivize increased collaboration for cost-efficient care. [17] Additionally, pharmacies have attempted to control costs without compromising care by using techniques such as drug formularies and prescribing protocols. [17] Ultimately, strategies that can incentivize communication among the various members of the care team and further align their goals can improve care coordination within an HMO.
Document 5 (Title: Smoking Cessation (Archived) -- Issues of Concern -- Behavioral Interventions): Behavioral interventions found to be effective in aiding adults in smoking cessation include in-person counseling, telephone counseling, and self-help materials. These interventions may increase rates of smoking cessation from a baseline of 5% to 11% in control groups to 7% to 13% in intervention groups. Both minor and intensive in-person interventions increase the proportion of persons who successfully quit smoking and remain abstinent. However, more or longer sessions improve cessation rates. According to the Public Health Service guidelines, individuals should undergo at least 4 in-person counseling sessions.  Interventions delivered by various types of providers, including physicians, nurses, psychologists, social workers, and cessation counselors, can be effective.  Effective telephone counseling interventions should provide at least 3 telephone calls and can be provided by trained professional counselors or health care providers. Self-help material shown to be effective is the one that is tailored to the individual patient and is primarily print-based. [6]
Document 6 (Title: Falls and Fall Prevention in Older Adults -- Treatment / Management -- Interventions Targeting Multiple Factors): Based on the initial assessment, a combination of interventions may be used to address multiple factors. Evidence suggests that this tailored treatment is more effective than standardized treatment for community-dwelling older adults. Specifically, research demonstrates that home safety interventions, vitamin D supplementation in those individuals with low vitamin D levels, and individually tailored interventions were correlated with fewer falls in community-dwelling individuals who had risk factors for falling. [13] Fall prevention clinics involving an interprofessional team, along with a community step-down program, can be instrumental in reducing fall rate and related injuries. [20]
Document 7 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): The broad aims of antimicrobial therapy are to treat and relieve the symptoms of current infection and to prevent relapse. Focal disease presentations may require specific intervention in addition to more prolonged and tailored antibiotic therapy. In addition, tuberculosis must always be excluded, or—to prevent the emergence of resistance—therapy must be tailored to specifically exclude drugs active against tuberculosis (e.g., rifampin used alone) or to include a full antituberculous regimen.
Document 8 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): InterventIons Interventions for pain must be tailored to each individual, with the goal of preempting chronic pain and relieving breakthrough pain. At the end of life, there is rarely reason to doubt a patient’s report of pain. Pain medications are the cornerstone of management. If they are failing and nonpharmacologic interventions— including radiotherapy and anesthetic or neurosurgical procedures such as peripheral nerve blocks or epidural medications—are required, a pain consultation is appropriate.
Document 9 (Title: The role of breast self-examination in breast cancer screening.): The efficacy of breast self-examination (BSE) behavior cannot be adequately evaluated until BSE proficiency is considered. Previous research supports the role of attitudinal and teaching interventions in increasing skills and frequency for BSE behavior, but more research using age-appropriate women and adequate outcome measures is needed. A preliminary analysis of data from 301 randomly selected women who were followed for 1 year after an initial teaching and/or attitudinal intervention is reported. Significant differences were obtained for attitudes toward breast cancer screening between scores before and after intervention using paired t test. Significant changes in proficiency and frequency also occurred after intervention, as well as percentage increases in nine individual BSE steps. Return demonstration scores and nodule detection are reported. Perceived barriers and confidence were significantly related to both frequency and proficiency 1 year postintervention using regression analysis. Knowledge was related to proficiency measures. Preliminary data suggest that BSE practice can be significantly improved through individually tailored attitudinal and teaching interventions.
Document 10 (Title: Psychological intervention): Psychological interventions can also be used to promote good mental health in order to prevent mental disorders. These interventions are not tailored towards treating a condition but are designed to foster healthy emotions, attitudes and habits. Such interventions can improve quality of life even when mental illness is not present. Interventions can be diverse and can be tailored specifically to the individual or group receiving treatment depending on their needs. This versatility adds to their effectiveness in addressing any kind of situation. Psychotherapy, also known as talk therapy, promotes a relationship between a trained psychotherapist and a person suffering from a psychological disorder. Positive activity interventions (PAIs) are a part of positive psychology. PAIs can be used in psychotherapy as well as outside of it. Examples include helping clients to focus on good things, the future self, gratitude, affirmation of the self and kindness towards others.
Document 11 (Title: Transtheoretical model): Within the health research domain, a 2005 systematic review of 37 randomized controlled trials claims that "there was limited evidence for the effectiveness of stage-based interventions as a basis for behavior change. Studies with which focused on increasing physical activity levels through active commute however showed that stage-matched interventions tended to have slightly more effect than non-stage matched interventions. Since many studies do not use all constructs of the TTM, additional research suggested that the effectiveness of interventions increases the better it is tailored on all core constructs of the TTM in addition to stage of change. In diabetes research the "existing data are insufficient for drawing conclusions on the benefits of the transtheoretical model" as related to dietary interventions. Again, studies with slightly different design, e.g. using different processes, proved to be effective in predicting the stage transition of intention to exercise in relation to
Document 12 (Title: Smoking cessation): The Freedom From Smoking group clinic includes eight sessions and features a step-by-step plan for quitting smoking. Each session is designed to help smokers gain control over their behavior. The clinic format encourages participants to work on the process and problems of quitting both individually and as part of a group. Multiple formats of psychosocial interventions increase quit rates: 10.8% for no intervention, 15.1% for one format, 18.5% for 2 formats, and 23.2% for three or four formats. The transtheoretical model, including "stages of change", has been used in tailoring smoking cessation methods to individuals, however, there is some evidence to suggest that "stage-based self-help interventions (expert systems and/or tailored materials) and individual counselling are neither more nor less effective than their non-stage-based equivalents."
Document 13 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Regardless of the specific nature of the systems pathobiologic approach used, these analyses will lead to a drastic revision of the way human disease is defined and treated, establishing the discipline of network medicine. This will be a lengthy and complicated process but ultimately will lead to better disease prevention and therapy and probably do so from an increasingly personalized perspective. The analysis of pathobiology from a systems-based perspective is likely to help define specific subsets of patients more likely to respond to particular interventions based on shared disease mechanisms. Although it is unlikely that the extreme of “individualized medicine” will ever be practical (or even desirable), complex diseases can be mechanistically subclassified and interventions may be tailored to those settings in which they are more likely to work.
Document 14 (Title: Effect of continuing medical education and cost reduction on physician compliance with mammography screening guidelines.): Primary care physicians perform breast cancer screening in women aged 50 years and older less frequently than recommended by national guidelines. A multimethod continuing medical education (CME) intervention was tested in an attempt to increase breast cancer screening practices in a predominantly fee-for-service practice community in New York State. Preintervention and postintervention surveys of primary care physicians were conducted in 1988 and 1990, respectively. Project-initiated, low-cost mammography in one town and the unanticipated provision of free mammography services in another town under nonproject auspices permitted a comparison to be made between these towns and towns where mammography screening was provided at the prevailing fees to determine the impact that cost has on physicians' referral of women patients for mammography. Physicians practicing in the towns in which the CME intervention was provided showed a significant increase, consistent across specialty groups and greatest among family physicians, in the number of reported mammography referrals of asymptomatic women aged 50 to 75 years. Changes in the CME control town were smaller and not statistically significant for the sample size available. The increase in compliance was as large in the CME-intervention towns, one without (19%) and one with low-cost mammography (20%), as the increase in the town with free mammography alone (18%). There were no significant increases in reported performance of breast examination. A multimethod program of CME is a feasible approach to increasing community physician compliance with mammography screening guidelines, particularly among family physicians, and can enhance the impact of reduced cost or have at least the equivalent effect of free mammography services.
Document 15 (Title: Pelvic Floor Dysfunction -- Prognosis): There are no universally curative therapies for PFD. Patients with both hypertonicity and hypotonicity symptoms can obtain some benefit from lifestyle changes, medications, and manipulative interventions, but seldom have complete resolution of symptoms. Typical for intervention for PFD, physical therapy techniques have demonstrated a 59% to 80% improvement or relief of women’s symptoms with pelvic floor hypertonicity. [45] As an example, an abdominal rectopexy for rectal prolapse has a 3% to 9% recurrence rate. [46] Unfortunately, the incidence of failure or recurrence increases with time. [46] Women with POP have improvements in sexual function and dyspareunia with surgical repair of the prolapse. Surgical interventions can correct the anatomic concerns of POP. [19]
