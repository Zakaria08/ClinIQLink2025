Document 1 (Title: Pinworm (parasite)): The pinworm (species Enterobius vermicularis), also known as threadworm (in the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand) or seatworm, is a parasitic worm. It is a nematode (roundworm) and a common intestinal parasite or helminth, especially in humans. The medical condition associated with pinworm infestation is known as pinworm infection (enterobiasis) (a type of helminthiasis) or less precisely as oxyuriasis in reference to the family Oxyuridae.
Document 2 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Life Cycle and Epidemiology Enterobius adult worms are ~1 cm long and dwell in the cecum. Gravid female worms migrate nocturnally into the perianal region and release up to 2000 immature eggs each. The eggs become infective within hours and are transmitted by hand-to-mouth passage. From ingested eggs, larvae hatch and mature into adults. This life cycle takes ~1 month, and adult worms survive for ~2 months. Self-infection results from perianal scratching and transport of infective eggs on the hands or under the nails to the mouth. Because of the ease of person-to-person spread, pinworm infections are common among family members.
Document 3 (Title: Enterobius Vermicularis -- Etiology): Infection most commonly occurs in children, but any individual is susceptible to E. vermicularis infection. People from tropical climates and school-aged children are the most vulnerable. Infection is caused by the ingestion of the pinworm eggs. Transmission is most commonly through the fecal-oral route. [3] Risk factors for pinworms include poor hygiene, eating after touching contaminated items and living with an individual who is identified as egg positive.
Document 4 (Title: [New anthelmintic drugs].): New anti-helminthic drugs have appeared lately: benzimidazoles (mebendazole, flubendazol, and abendazole), praziquantel and ivermectin. Mebendazol and flubendazol are poorly absorbed and are effective for ascaris, oxyuriasis and trycocephalus both in adults and children. Abendazole is well absorbed and may be considered the drug of choice for ascaris and oxyuriasis at a single 400 mg dose. This drug may also be used for hydatid cyst when surgery is not possible and for cysticercosis of the nervous system. Praziquantel is useful for treatment of tenia infections and ivermectin is useful for strongyloides and trichostrongyloides. Detailed dose schedules for different parasitic diseases are given in the text.
Document 5 (Title: Enterobius Vermicularis -- Introduction): Enterobius vermicularis , also called pinworm, is one of the most common nematode infections in the world. Originally, E. vermicularis was named Oxyuris vermicularis. Humans are the only natural host for this infection. Transmission occurs in people who are living in crowded environments and usually occurs within families. The worms are tiny, thread-like, and whitish. The worm is named after the characteristic pin-like tail present on the posterior part of female worms. [1] [2]
Document 6 (Title: [A rare finding at gynaecological laparotomy: ovarian pregnancy and pinworm abscess (author's transl)].): A case of concommitant ovarian pregnancy and pinworm abscess is described. The histology and the incidence of Oxyuriasis in the female genital tract are discussed. The clinical symptoms and the management of the condition are also discussed.
Document 7 (Title: Pinworm (parasite)): Almost the entire body of a gravid female becomes filled with eggs. The estimations of the number of eggs in a gravid female pinworm range from about 11,000 to 16,000. The egg-laying process begins about five weeks after initial ingestion of pinworm eggs by the human host. The gravid female pinworms migrate through the colon towards the rectum at a rate of 12 to 14 cm per hour. They emerge from the anus, and while moving on the skin near the anus, the female pinworms deposit eggs either through (1) contracting and expelling the eggs, (2) dying and then disintegrating, or (3) bodily rupture due to the host scratching the worm. After depositing the eggs, the female becomes opaque and dies. The female emerges from the anus to obtain the oxygen necessary for the maturation of the eggs. Infection E. vermicularis causes the medical condition enterobiasis, whose primary symptom is itching in the anal area.
Document 8 (Title: Phthiriasis Palpebrarum -- Pathophysiology): The lifecycle of the pubic louse consists of 3 main stages: egg, nymph, and adult. Female lice lay around 20 to 30 eggs during their lifespan, which are attached to the hair shaft near the skin (see Image . Phthiriasis Palpebrarum with Severe Anterior Blepharitis). These eggs, also known as nits, hatch into nymphs after about 6 to 10 days, and the nymphs reach maturity within 10 to 15 days. The adult lice can live up to a month on the host if untreated. The organism's entire lifecycle from egg to adult may be completed within 3 to 4 weeks, allowing rapid proliferation if left untreated. [25] The adult lice and their nymphs cause continuous irritation, leading to secondary bacterial infections and blepharitis due to constant rubbing of the eyes.
Document 9 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Clinical Features Most pinworm infections are asymptomatic. Perianal pruritus is the cardinal symptom. The itching, which is often worse at night as a result of the nocturnal migration of the female worms, may lead to excoriation and bacterial superinfection. Heavy infections have been alleged to cause abdominal pain and weight loss. On rare occasions, pinworms invade the female genital tract, causing vulvovaginitis and pelvic or peritoneal granulomas. Eosinophilia is uncommon. Diagnosis Since pinworm eggs are not released in feces, the diagnosis cannot be made by conventional fecal ova and parasite tests. Instead, eggs are detected by the application of clear cellulose acetate tape to the perianal region in the morning. After the tape is transferred to a slide, microscopic examination will detect pinworm eggs, which are oval, measure 55 by 25 μm, and are flattened along one side.
Document 10 (Title: Pediatrics_Nelson): Eosinophilia and hypergammaglobulinemia associated with elevated isohemagglutinin levels suggest the diagnosis, which is confirmed by serology (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) or, less commonly, by biopsy. This is usually a self-limited illness. In severe disease, albendazole or mebendazole is used. Deworming puppies and kittens, major excreters of eggs, decreases the risk of infection. Available @ StudentConsult.com Pinworm is caused by Enterobius vermicularis, a nematode that is distributed worldwide. Enterobiasis affects individuals at all socioeconomic levels, especially children. Crowded living conditions predispose to infection. Humans ingest the eggs carried on hands, present in house dust or on bedclothes. The eggs hatch in the stomach, and the larvae migrate to the cecum and mature. At night the females migrate to the perianal area to lay their eggs, which are viable for 2 days.
Document 11 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): Mebendazole is indicated for use in ascariasis, trichuriasis, hookworm and pinworm infections, and certain other helminthic infections. It can be taken before or after meals; the tablets should be chewed before swallowing. For pinworm infection, the dose is 100 mg once, repeated at 2 weeks. For ascariasis, trichuriasis, hookworm, and Trichostrongylus infections, a dosage of 100 mg twice daily for 3 days is used for adults and for children older than 2 years. Cure rates are good for pinworm infections and ascariasis but have been disappointing in recent studies of trichuriasis, although efficacy for trichuriasis is better than that of albendazole. Cure rates are also low for hookworm infections, but a marked reduction in the worm burden occurs in those not cured. For intestinal capillariasis, mebendazole is used at a dosage of 200 mg twice daily for 21 or more days. In trichinosis, limited reports suggest efficacy against adult worms in the intestinal tract and tissue larvae. Treatment
Document 12 (Title: [Spontaneous stercoral fistula due to oxyurids: apropos of 1 case].): A spontaneous stercoral fistula containing pinworms was observed in a patient, 35 years after an appendicectomy. The various surgical complications of oxyuriasis are reviewed, in particular, the possibilities for the parasite to traverse the intestinal wall. In the case reported here, it appears that infiltration occurred in the external wall of the caecum.
Document 13 (Title: Scabies -- Pathophysiology): Adult female mites dig burrow tunnels 1 to 10 millimeters long within the superficial layers of the epidermis and lay 2 to 3 eggs daily. The mites die 30 to 60 days later, and the eggs hatch after approximately 2 to 3 weeks. It merits mentioning that not all treatment options can penetrate the eggs stored within the skin [2] [7] .
Document 14 (Title: Pinworm (parasite)): Although infection often occurs via ingestion of embryonated eggs by inadequate hand washing or nail biting, inhalation followed by swallowing of airborne eggs may occur rarely. The eggs hatch in the duodenum (i.e., first part of the small intestine). The emerging pinworm larvae grow rapidly to a size of 140 to 150 μm, and migrate through the small intestine towards the colon. During this migration, they moult twice and become adults. Females survive for 5 to 13 weeks, and males about 7 weeks. The male and female pinworms mate in the ileum (i.e., last part of the small intestine), whereafter the male pinworms usually die, and are passed out with stool. The gravid female pinworms settle in the ileum, caecum (i.e., beginning of the large intestine), appendix and ascending colon, where they attach themselves to the mucosa and ingest colonic contents.
Document 15 (Title: [Oxyurid granuloma of the mesentery].): A 44-year-old woman presented with an acute abdominal syndrome associated with fever. Laparotomy revealed a mesenteric mass; pathology demonstrated a granuloma containing an adult threadworm (Enterobius vermicularis) and its eggs. Ectopic oxyuriasis is rare, and only three cases of peritoneal granuloma distant from the pelvis or the appendix have been reported previously. Our observation is the first case to which a clinical symptomatology could be ascribed. The pathogenesis and the treatment of this particular localization of oxyuriasis are discussed.
