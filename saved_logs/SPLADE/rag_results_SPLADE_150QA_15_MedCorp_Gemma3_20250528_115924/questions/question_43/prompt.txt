Document 1 (Title: Community-acquired pneumonia): Hospitalization Some CAP patients require intensive care, with clinical prediction rules such as the pneumonia severity index and CURB-65 guiding the decision whether or not to hospitalize. Factors increasing the need for hospitalization include: Age greater than 65 Underlying chronic illnesses Respiratory rate greater than 30 per minute Systolic blood pressure less than 90 mmHg Heart rate greater than 125 per minute Temperature below 35 or over 40 °C Confusion Evidence of infection outside the lung Laboratory results indicating hospitalization include: Arterial oxygen tension less than 60 mm Hg Carbon dioxide over 50 mmHg or pH under 7.35 while breathing room air Hematocrit under 30 percent Creatinine over 1.2 mg/dl or blood urea nitrogen over 20 mg/dl White-blood-cell count under 4 × 10^9/L or over 30 × 10^9/L Neutrophil count under 1 x 10^9/L
Document 2 (Title: [Klebsiella pneumoniae meningitis associated with liver abscess: a case report].): We report a rare case of Klebsiella pneumoniae meningitis associated with liver abscess, which was successfully treated with cefotaxime (CTX), one of the third-generation cephalosporins. A 53-year-old man was admitted to Keio University Hospital on June 13, 1988, because of a fever and a headache. On June 3, he suddenly started shivering and his temperature rose to 39 degrees C. He then began to complain of polydipsia, polyuria, and a weight loss of 4 kg a week. On June 11, he developed a severe headache. Four years prior to this incident, he had been diagnosed as having diabetes after a routine medical examination, but had neglected to undergo medical treatment. On admission, laboratory data showed leukocytosis, hyperglycemia (394 mg/dl) and ketonuria (4+). A lumbar puncture yielded cloudy cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) containing 500/3 cells/mm8, of which about 70% were neutrophils. A diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis and purulent meningitis was made. A treatment with ampicillin (ABPC) and CTX, (12 g/day, each) was begun. On the third day, cultures of a blood specimen and CSF yielded both K. pneumoniae. The MICs of CTX to K. pneumoniae isolated from blood and CSF were both 0.05 microgram/ml. ABPC was discontinued, gentamicin was administered for 2 days, CTX was continued at the same dosage level and an administration of prednisolone 40 mg daily was begun.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Document 3 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): A 45-year-old man is brought to the local hospital emer-gency department by ambulance. His wife reports that he had been in his normal state of health until 3 days ago when he developed a fever and a productive cough. Dur-ing the last 24 hours he has complained of a headache and is increasingly confused. His wife reports that his medical history is significant only for hypertension, for which he takes hydrochlorothiazide and lisinopril, and that he is allergic to amoxicillin. She says that he developed a rash many years ago when prescribed amoxicillin for bron-chitis. In the emergency department, the man is febrile (38.7°C [101.7°F]), hypotensive (90/54 mmHg), tachypneic (36/min), and tachycardic (110/min). He has no signs of meningismus but is oriented only to person. A stat chest x-ray shows a left lower lung consolidation consistent with pneumonia. A CT scan is not concerning for lesions or elevated intracranial pressure. The plan is to start empiric antibiotics and perform a
Document 4 (Title: 38-Year-Old Male Presents With Lower Extremity Edema -- Case Presentation): His physical exam revealed clear lungs and a normal heart exam on auscultation. His abdomen was soft and non-tender, and his skin was warm and dry with no rash. He had 2 plus pitting edema at the ankles. Initial laboratory data was consistent with acute kidney injury (AKI) with worsening creatinine from 1.2 to 1.6 over 1 month and nephrotic range proteinuria. Serologies for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, anti-nuclear antibody (ANA), c-ANCA, serine protease 3 (PR3) IgG, myeloperoxidase antibody (MPO), and complement levels were sent. He was started on losartan for proteinuria with plans for renal biopsy; however, he was lost to follow up. The patient then presented two weeks later with worsening edema to his waist, continued weight gain, mild hemoptysis, and streaks of blood in the stool. Physical examination now showed worsening pitting edema up to his waist with new non-pruritic, erythematous excoriations on the medial aspect of his thighs bilaterally. He was admitted to the hospital with concern for worsening vasculitis. He was started on oral prednisone and underwent a renal biopsy. For his edema, he was started on diuretics to which he responded well. Due to persistent leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing was performed to complete the workup.

Document 6 (Title: [Bronchiectasis treated with negative extra-thoracic pressure ventilation].): A 25-year old man with 5-year history of bronchiectasis was admitted to the ICU complaining of severe shortness of breath. He had a respiratory rate of 40 to 50 breath/min. On 0.5 l/min of oxygen with nasal cannula, arterial blood pH was 7.39, Paco2 52.3 mmHg, Pao2 45.0 mmHg. Then, on 1 l/min of oxygen, Pao2 was unchanged, but Paco2 increased to 58 mmHg. As his consciousness was so clear, we applied to him the negative extra-thoracic pressure ventilator which was designed by the authors. Negative extra-thoracic pressure ventilation (NETPV) was maintained at a IMV rate of 30 breath/min, peak negative extra-thoracic pressure of -20 to -30 cmH2O, and an inspiratory/expiratory ratio of 1:2. During NETPV, his respiratory rate and oxygen consumption were decreased and Pao2 was increased compared with his spontaneous breathing. He made a recovery from dyspnea, especially, he was able to take a deep breath. When NETPV was applied to him, pulmonary artery and arterial catheterizations revealed that central venous pressure was slightly decreased, cardiac index unchanged or slightly decreased, heart rate, systemic blood pressure, and pulmonary arterial pressure unchanged compared with spontaneous breathing. The patient was able to read books and maintained communication in his voice with his family and the medical staff. After 3 days of the treatment with NETPV, a marked improvement was noted and the patient was discharged from the ICU. NETPV has the benefits as follows. First, it is very easy for both a patient and a doctor to assist his breathing because an endotracheal intubation is not necessary.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Document 7 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): Her social history is significant for alcohol use (three to four glasses of wine/night). Her vital signs include the following: temperature 99.8°F, blood pressure 132/64 mm Hg, pulse 78 bpm, and respiratory rate 15/min. On physical examination, she had left upper abdominal tenderness with evidence of hepatomegaly and mild scleral icterus. Laboratory data revealed the following: alanine aminotransferase, 527 IU/L (normal 10–35 IU/L); aspartate aminotransferase, 425 IU/L (normal < 35 IU/L); and bilirubin, 2.9 mg/dL (normal 0.1–0.3 mg/dL). What medications do OTC cold and flu preparations typically contain? Which of the OTC medications might have contrib-uted to the patient’s current symptoms? KH, a 55-year-old woman, presents to the emergency department with nausea, vomiting, and complaints of new-onset flu symptoms over the past several days. Her past medical history is significant for allergic rhinitis and chronic lower back pain secondary to a work-related fall 2 years ago. Her
Document 8 (Title: [Neonatal chylous ascites: report of two cases].): Chylous ascites in neonates is an unusual and etiologically poor understood entity. Our first case was a female newborn who suffered from abdominal distension and recurrent vomiting after birth. The history, physical, laboratory, and radiologic evaluations were not diagnostic except the evidence of obvious ascites. Paracentesis was performed and ascitic fluid was obtained. She was later discharged on a strict low-fat medium-chain triglycerides formula. She was found to have continue increase in abdominal girth, poor growth and development, and respiratory distress in which led her to readmission at 8 months of age. Exploratory laparotomy was done in order to rule out an anatomical lesion in which may be obstructing the lymphatic flow; but no such lesion could be found. She expired at 1 year of age with chylothorax, chylopericardium and lobar pneumonia. The second case, a 37-day-old male baby, who was admitted because of right inguinal hernia. Milky ascitic fluid in the abdomen was incidentally found during herniorrhaphy. Analysis of the fluid revealed protein 1,616 mg/dl, glucose 487 mg/dl, and triglyceride 796 mg/dl. Culture of peritoneal fluid grew no bacteria. Other laboratory findings were: serum protein 4.8 mg/dl, and BUN 14 mg/dl. A plain film of abdomen and sonogram showed massive ascites. The infant was then put on Pregestimil with the hope that the medium-chain triglyceride formula would improve his condition. Since then the child's abdominal girth did not increase and he continued to growth and develop normally at 4 months follow up.
Document 9 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): Ramin Sam, MD, Harlan E. Ives, MD, PhD, & David Pearce, MD A 65-year-old man has a history of diabetes and chronic kidney disease with baseline creatinine of 2.2 mg/dL. Despite five different antihypertensive drugs, his clinic blood pres-sure is 176/92 mm Hg; he has mild dyspnea on exertion and 2–3+ edema on exam. He has been taking furosemide 80 mg twice a day for 1 year now. At the clinic visit, hydrochlorothi-azide 25 mg daily is added for better blood pressure control and also to treat symptoms and signs of fluid overload. Two weeks later, the patient presents to the emergency depart-ment with symptoms of weakness, anorexia, and generalized malaise. His blood pressure is now 91/58 mm Hg, and he has lost 15 kg in 2 weeks. His laboratory tests are signifi-cant for a serum creatinine of 10.8 mg/dL. What has led to the acute kidney injury? What is the reason for the weight loss? What precautions could have been taken to avoid this hospitalization?
Document 10 (Title: [A case of early syphilis presenting general paresis-like symptoms and bilateral tonic pupils].): A 40-year-old man was admitted after 8 months of speech disturbance and locomotive ataxia. He had no seizures, lightning pains, paresthesia, visual loss, bladder disturbance or rectal incontinence. He had never been neurologically or psychiatrically ill and had no history of syphilis. When the patient was admitted, his general physical examination including blood pressure and dermatologic examination was normal. His consciousness was alert. He was found to have a deterioration of mental status such as inability to concentrate, failing memory, amnesia and circumstantiality. His pupils were anisocoric and Achilles jerks were absent. No rigidity of the neck muscles, paralysis and sensory disturbance were recognized. Romberg's sign was absent. The right pupil was 7.0 mm and the left was 6.0 mm in room illumination. The pupils were nonreactive to bright light and both did not constricted to near stimuli. 0.125% pilocarpine eyedrops produced bilateral pupillary constriction. The results indicated bilateral tonic pupils. Laboratory data revealed white cell count of 12,600/mm3 and normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 8 mm/hr. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination revealed the following: opening pressure, 140 mm of water; cell counts, 76/mm2 (mononuclear cells); total protein, 116 mg/dl; glucose, 57 mg/dl. A serum venereal disease research laboratories (VDRL) test was positive in a 1:32 titer confirmed by positive treponema pallidum hemagglutination (TPHA) test in a 1:40,960 titer and positive fluorescent treponemal antibody-absorption (FTA-ABS) test. Serum TPHA-IgM was positive in a 1:320 titer but TPHA-IgG was negative. CSF examination revealed positive TPHA test (titer of 1:2,560) and positive FTA-ABS test.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Document 13 (Title: Clomiphene -- Indications): However, a case study of a 65-year-old man who had frequent headaches for years and was refractory to treatment was finally diagnosed with SUNCT syndrome. He was initiated on 50 mg of clomiphene daily for 2 weeks. Four days after therapy initiation, the frequency of his headaches reduced, but the pain did not subside entirely. The dose was increased to 75 mg daily, and after day 5, the patient became pain-free. After 1.5 months on this dosage, the patient was doing well but experienced a slight recurrence of the attack. His physician increased his clomiphene dose to 100 mg/d, and he had no attacks for 3 months. At this point, the clomiphene was tapered off, and 4 months after discontinuing clomiphene, the patient continued to be pain-free. [13]
Document 14 (Title: Pennsylvania Child Abuse Recognition and Reporting -- Pearls and Other Issues -- A 16-year-old child presents to the emergency department due to acting out at school. Shortly after arrival, the child asks for a sandwich. The school could not reach the biological mother, and the biological father is deceased. The child indicates his mother is on a honeymoon on a boat somewhere in the Cayman Islands. He is currently being taken care of by his grandmother, who is at work as a dietician, but she will be home shortly. The mother left him with $200 ten days ago and told him to buy local fast food for both of them for dinner. He admits he was told not to spend more than $20 daily and avoid dessert due to his grandmother's diabetes. He says he is out of money because he bought dessert daily and spent $30 instead of $20. He says he is "starving." There is no food in the house besides the fruits, vegetables, and frozen meals his mother provided. Which of the following would be an appropriate response of the emergency department health providers?): The child should be given food, and the grandmother should be contacted. Additionally, while there may not be reasonable cause to suspect child abuse, the PA CPSL prescribes that a person, hospital, institution, school, facility, agency, or agency employee acting in good faith shall have immunity from civil and criminal liability that might otherwise result from making a report of suspected child abuse or making a referral for general protective services, regardless of whether the report is required to be made under the PA CPSL. General concerns for a child's safety, health, and well-being may be reported to ChildLine for assessment of services and support.
Document 15 (Title: Root Cause Analysis and Medical Error Prevention -- Function -- Case example 5): A community clinic treats approximately 110 patients daily. The clinic is run by 2 primary care physicians, with the assistance of 2 nurses and scribes. A 10-year-old boy was brought to the clinic by his parents due to a runny nose for the last 10 days. On examination, the primary care physician diagnosed allergic rhinitis and advised them to use over-the-counter cetirizine. One of the scribes had called in sick that day, so a secretary was assisting the physician. The physician advised the parents that cetirizine is an over-the-counter medication that could be obtained at their pharmacy of choice. After 2 days, the patient's mother returned to the clinic and reported that the child was lethargic. The clinic front desk staff told the mother they would convey this to the physician, who was very busy that day. The physician instructed the staff to inform the parents that somnolence was typical for children taking cetirizine and to keep the child at home for the next few days. The message was conveyed to the mother, who decided to take the child to another specialist as she was concerned by the sedation. The specialist noted that the child was taking a 10-mg cetirizine tablet twice a day, which is double the recommended amount.
