The classic and distinctive cardiac manifestation is a congenital atrioventricular block that can present as first, second, and especially third-degree AV block. Commonly presents between 18 to 24 weeks of gestation. Other cardiac manifestations include sinus bradycardia, QT-interval prolongation, cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure, myocarditis and structural or valvular abnormalities (ventricular septal defects, ostium secundum type atrial septal defects, patent foramen ovale, patent ductus arteriosus, pulmonary stenosis, pulmonary valve dysplasia, fusion of the chordae tendineae of the tricuspid valve). Second- and third-degree AV block present in utero with fetal bradycardia, with a ventricular rate between 40 and 80 per minute. Postnatally the heart rate is found to be less than 100 per minute, rarely associated with signs of congestive heart failure (diaphoresis, pallor, peripheral edema, prominent jugular veins and crackles on auscultation of the lungs). On cardiac auscultation, there can be an appreciation of nonspecific signs such as intermittent gallops, variability with the intensity of the first heart sound, intermittent cannon waves, and murmurs. Five percent to 10% of infants present with a severe AV block that precipitates myocardial dysfunction due to endocardial fibroelastosis and myocardial fibrosis, associated with right ventricular pacing and subsequent ventricular asynchrony and dysfunction.

Severe pulmonary valve thickening was present in 16 and ventricular septal defects with overriding of the aorta in 15 of the 90 near-term fetuses and in 10 and nine, respectively, of the 79 neonates at 2-4 d of age. These abnormalities occurred together (tetralogy of Fallot) in seven of the near-term fetuses and in five of the neonates. A narrow pulmonary outflow tract was present in 55% of the fetuses and in 56% of the neonates. The wall of the pulmonary arterial branch was abnormally thick in 19% of the fetuses and in 26% of the neonates, most of which did not have septal defects. In about 80% of the fetuses, the middle latitudinal muscle bundle of the ventricular septum was not continuous with the left ventricular free wall, but rather with the right; after birth, it was discontinuous with both free walls. The heart was abnormally heavy in 49% of the 79 neonates. In about half of the heavy hearts, there were no septal defects or pulmonary valvular and arterial lesions. There were double aortic arches in four and right aortic arches in six of the total WKY fetuses and neonates; the ductus arteriosus was abnormally small in 47% and the aorta was large in 51% of the near-term fetuses. This constellation of congenital heart disease is genetic in origin, but altered by hemodynamics late in fetal life.",

The findings were: ventricular septal defect in 16 cases (80%), valvular anomalies in 12 (63%), patent ductus arteriosus in nine (47%) and atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale in 7 cases (36%). We found some complex congenital cardiac diseases: one atrioventricular canal, one tetralogy of Fallot, one hypoplastic left ventricle with mitral atresia and double outlet right ventricle, one case of univentricular heart with aortic outlet from a rudimentary cavity, a right ventricular atresia with pulmonary and tricuspid valves atresia. Nine cases of trisomy 13 were diagnosed (seven females and two males). We found: ventricular septal defect in 7 cases (77%), valvular disease in five (100% of the necropsy studies), secundum atrial septal defect in 4 patients (80%) and patent ductus arteriosus in two. Two cases presented hypoplastic left ventricle with aortic arch hypoplasia, one of them had subaortic stenosis and left superior vena cava being connected to the right atrium via coronary sinus; one case showed fibroelastosis. Our results have been similar to the previously reported and confirm the invariably presence of cardiac malformations in these syndromes.

        "content": "In the population of live born children in the County of Vestfold, Norway, during the seven-year period 1982-88 (N = 15,307), 138 cases of congenital heart defects were diagnosed (patent ductus arteriosus in preterm infants excluded), an incidence of 0.9%. In 114 infants (83%) the defect was diagnosed before discharge from hospital after birth (nursery, neonatal unit), in 20 infants (14%) it was diagnosed later during the first year of life, and in four (3%) during the second year of life. In 24 children (17%) congenital heart defect was associated with a syndrome (Down syndrome eight, Edwards syndrome three, other syndromes three), or other congenital malformations (single eight, multiple two). Diagnosis was made clinically only (including ECG, phonocardiography and X-ray pictures) in 15 patients (11%). 13 were classified as having ventricular septal defects, and two were unclassified. Echocardiography was performed in 120 children (87%), heart catheterization in 44 (32%), surgery in 47 (34%), and autopsy in 12 (9%). 15 children (11%) died, all during the first year after birth. 45 children (33%) are healthy after spontaneous closure of a ventricular (41 children) or atrial septal defect (four children), and 15 (11%) after surgical repair. 63 (46%) are alive with a defect. We found a tendency towards increasing incidence of congenital heart defects. This increase was explained by echocardiographic diagnosis of small muscular ventricular septal defects in the early neonatal period, with spontaneous closure of the defect during the first year of life.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
