Document 1 (Title: Biochemistry, Proteins Enzymes -- Function): Enzymes do not alter or shift the equilibrium of a given reaction but instead affect the free energy required to initiate a conversion, which affects the reaction rate. The energy hump that must be surmounted for a reaction to progress is called the activation energy; this is the highest energy on a reaction diagram. It is the most unstable conformation of the substrate in the reaction. Enzymes generally do not add energy to the reaction but instead lower the transition state energy to require less activation energy.
Document 2 (Title: Cell_Biology_Alberts): Thus, it is claimed that enzymes like acetylcholinesterase and1 liter/mmole fumarase are “perfect enzymes,” each enzyme having evolved to the point where nearly every collision with its substrate converts the substrate to a product. [S] Km Figure 3–47 enzymatic acceleration of chemical reactions by decreasing the activation energy. There is a single transition state in this example. However, often both the uncatalyzed reaction (A) and the enzyme-catalyzed reaction (B) go through a series of transition states. In that case, it is the transition state with the highest energy (ST and EST) that determines the activation energy and limits the rate of the reaction. (S = substrate; P = product of the reaction; ES = enzyme–substrate complex; EP = enzyme– product complex.) Because this tight binding greatly lowers the energy of the transition state, the enzyme greatly accelerates a particular reaction by lowering the activation energy that is required (Figure 3–47).
Document 3 (Title: Physiology, Proteins -- Cellular Level -- Transportation): The most important proteins in the body are those that help with reactions. These are called enzymes; their main job is to help the body generate energy. Reactions are always possible but not favorable. Approximately 90% of the reactions that occur in the body would not operate at the appropriate speed required for life. Enzymes, therefore, act as "catalysts." Approximately 80% of reactions in the body would not occur without an enzyme to catalyze the reaction. Enzymes make reactions more probable by making them easier to occur. They bring substrates together in space and time. Enzymes lower the free energy of activation, which translates to less energy needed for a reaction to occur. Enzymes also stabilize the high-energy substrate intermediate within a reaction and are not consumed in the reaction. An enzyme can be classified as globular if it's a highly folded polypeptide that often exhibits a spherical shape and is stabilized by weak chemical interactions. [8] Sources
Document 4 (Title: Enzyme): The rate of a reaction is dependent on the activation energy needed to form the transition state which then decays into products. Enzymes increase reaction rates by lowering the energy of the transition state. First, binding forms a low energy enzyme-substrate complex (ES). Second, the enzyme stabilises the transition state such that it requires less energy to achieve compared to the uncatalyzed reaction (ES‡). Finally the enzyme-product complex (EP) dissociates to release the products. Enzymes can couple two or more reactions, so that a thermodynamically favorable reaction can be used to "drive" a thermodynamically unfavourable one so that the combined energy of the products is lower than the substrates. For example, the hydrolysis of ATP is often used to drive other chemical reactions. Kinetics
Document 5 (Title: Membrane phospholipids and the dark side of vision.): The key step in the visual pigment regeneration process is an enzyme-catalyzed trans to cis retinoid isomerization reaction. This reaction is of substantial general interest, because it requires the input of metabolic energy. The energy is needed because the 11-cis-retinoid reaction products are approximately 4 kcal/mol higher in energy than their all-trans congeners. In the retinal pigment epithelium a novel enzymatic system has been discovered which is capable of converting all-trans-retinol into all-trans retinyl esters, by means of a lecithin retinol acyl transferase (LRAT), followed by the direct processing of the ester into 11-cis-retinol. In this process the free energy of hydrolysis of a retinyl ester, estimated to be approximately -5 kcal/mol, is coupled to the endothermic (+4 kcal/mol) isomerization reaction, resulting in an overall exothermic process. The overall process is analogous to ATP-dependent group transfer reactions, but here the energy is provided by the membrane phospholipids. This process illustrates a new role for membranes: they can serve as an energy source.
Document 6 (Title: Activation energy): site release energy. A chemical reaction is able to manufacture a high-energy transition state molecule more readily when there is a stabilizing fit within the active site of a catalyst. The binding energy of a reaction is this energy released when favorable interactions between substrate and catalyst occur. The binding energy released assists in achieving the unstable transition state. Reactions otherwise without catalysts need a higher input of energy to achieve the transition state. Non-catalyzed reactions do not have free energy available from active site stabilizing interactions, such as catalytic enzyme reactions.
Document 7 (Title: Enzyme catalysis): In 1971-1972 the first quantum-mechanical model of enzyme catalysis was formulated. Active enzyme The binding energy of the enzyme-substrate complex cannot be considered as an external energy which is necessary for the substrate activation. The enzyme of high energy content may firstly transfer some specific energetic group X1 from catalytic site of the enzyme to the final place of the first bound reactant, then another group X2 from the second bound reactant (or from the second group of the single reactant) must be transferred to active site to finish substrate conversion to product and enzyme regeneration. We can present the whole enzymatic reaction as a two coupling reactions:
Document 8 (Title: Biochemistry_Lippinco): Enzymes are protein catalysts that increase the velocity of a chemical reaction by lowering the energy of the transition state (Fig. 5.23). They are not consumed during the reaction. Enzyme molecules contain a special cleft called the active site, which contains amino acid side chains that participate in substrate binding and catalysis. The active site binds the substrate, forming an enzyme–substrate (ES) complex. Binding is thought to cause a conformational change in the enzyme (induced fit) that allows catalysis. ES is converted to enzyme and product. An enzyme allows a reaction to proceed rapidly under conditions prevailing in the cell by providing an alternate reaction pathway with a lower activation energy (Ea). Because the enzyme does not change the free energies of the reactants or products, it does not change the equilibrium of the reaction. Most enzymes show Michaelis-Menten kinetics, and a plot of the initial reaction velocity (vo) against substrate concentration ([S]) has a
Document 9 (Title: Substrate specificity and stereoselectivity of horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase. Kinetic evaluation of binding and activation parameters controlling the catalytic cycles of unbranched, acyclic secondary alcohols and ketones as substrates of the native and active-site-specific Co(II)-substituted enzyme.): 1. The steady-state parameters kcat and Km and the rate constants of hydride transfer for the substrates isopropanol/acetone; (S)-2-butanol, (R)-2-butanol/2-butanone; (S)-2-pentanol, (R)-2-pentanol/2-pentanone; 3-pentanol/3-pentanone; (S)-2-octanol and (R)-2-octanol have been determined for the native Zn(II)-containing horse-liver alcohol dehydrogenase (LADH) and the specific active-site-substituted Co(II)LADH. 2. A combined evaluation of steady-state kinetic data and rate constants obtained from stopped-flow measurements, allowed the determination of all rate constants of the following ordered bi-bi mechanism: E in equilibrium E.NAD in equilibrium E.NAD.R1R2 CHOH in equilibrium E.NADH.R1R2CO in equilibrium E.NADH in equilibrium E. 3. On the basis of the different substrate specificities of LADH and yeast alcohol dehydrogenase (YADH), a procedure has been developed to evaluate the enantiomeric product composition of ketone reductions. 2-Butanone and 2-pentanone reductions revealed (S)-2-butanol (86%) and (S)-2-pentanol (95%) as the major products. 4. The observed enantioselectivity implies the existence of two productive ternary complexes; E.NADH.(pro-S) 2-butanone and E.NADH.(pro-R) 2-butanone. All rate constants describing the kinetic pathways of the system (S)-2-butanol, (R)-2-butanol/2-butanone have been determined. These data have been used to estimate the expected enantiomer product composition of 2-butanone reductions using apparent kcat/Km values for the two different ternary-complex configurations of 2-butanone. Additionally, these data have been used for computer simulations of the corresponding reaction cycles. Calculated, simulated and experimental data were found to be in good agreement. Thus, the system (S)-2-butanol, (R)-2-butanol/2-butanone is the first example of a LADH-catalyzed reaction for which the stereochemical course could be described in terms of rate constants of the underlying mechanism. 5. The effects of Co(II) substitution on the different steps of the kinetic pathway have been investigated. The free energy of activation is higher for alcohol oxidation and lower for ketone reduction when catalyzed by Co(II)LADH in comparison to Zn(II)LADH. However, the free energies of binding are affected by metal substitution in such a way that the enantioselectivity of ketone reduction is not significantly changed by the substitution of Co(II) for Zn(II). 6. Evaluation of the data shows that substrate specificity and stereoselectivity result from combination of the free energies of binding and activation, with differences in binding energies as the dominating factors. In this regard, the interactions of substrate molecules with the protein moiety are dominant over the interactions with the catalytic metal ion.
Document 10 (Title: Reaction of N-acetylglucosamine oligosaccharides with lysozyme. Temperature, pH, and solvent deuterium isotope effects; equilbrium, steady state, and pre-steady state measurements*.): Temperature jump and stopped flow methods were used to study at pH 7.0 the temperature dependence of elementary steps of the reactions of lysozyme with the beta(1 yields 4)-linked trimer, tetramer, and hexamer of N-acetylglucosamine. The steady state rate of cleavage of the hexasaccharide was determined as a function of temperature (5 degrees-40 degrees) and pH(2 to 8) in H-2O solution and as a function of pD(2.5 to 9.5) at 40 degrees in D-2O solution. The apparent enthalpies of the two ionizations of apparent pK 3.8 and 6.7 observed in measurements of k are 0 to 2 kcal/mol. The energy of activation determined for the pH optimum is 21.5 kcal/mol. The solvent deuterium isotope effect measured for k at the pH (pD) optimum is 1.5 And reflects isotope effects on pre-equilibrium steps and on the rate-determining step. Transfer from H-2O to D-2O solution produces 0.2 to 0.4 kcal/mol more negative free energies of saccharide binding and no changes in the enthalpies of binding. Pre-steady state, steady state, and equilibrium measurements indicate a pathway for the reaction of lysozyme with hexasaccharide. The results define for this mechanism the complete free energy profile and an essentially complete enthalpy profile. Three of the five observable ES complexes are present at nearly equal concentrations. The free energies of the transition states are within a range of 3 kcal. The enthalpies of productive enzyme-substrate complexes are about 5 kcal/mol greater than the enthalpies of nonproductive complexes. Changes in tryptophan fluorescence were observed for each elementary step, and changes in pK of Glu-35 for the isomerizations of nonproductive and productive complexes. The signal changes during formation of nonproductive complexes are the same for the oligosaccharides (ClcNAc)3 to (GlcNAc)6. The changes for productive complexes are similar but not identical with saccharides (GlcNAc)4 to (GlcNAc)6. Correlations of the present data with previous crystallographic and solution measurements indicate the structures of productive and nonproductive ES complexes and suggest that full interaction of the substrate with the enzyme active site is established in the rate-determining step.
Document 11 (Title: Cysteinyl-tRNA synthetase from Escherichia coli does not need an editing mechanism to reject serine and alanine. High binding energy of small groups in specific molecular interactions.): The cysteinyl-tRNA synthetase from Escherichia coli only very slowly activates serine, alanine, and alpha-aminobutyrate, the possible competitors of cysteine. The upper limits on the values of kcat/KM for the amino acid dependent ATP/pyrophosphate exchange reactions, relative to that of cysteine, are less than 10(-8), 2 x 10(-7), and 3 x 10(-6), respectively. It is calculated from these data and the concentrations of the amino acids in vivo that the error rates for the misincorporation of serine and alanine for cysteine are less than 10(-9) and 5 x 10(-8), respectively. There is no need for an error correcting mechanism and no evidence has been found to implicate one: there is no detectable ATP/pyrophosp hatase activity of the enzyme in the presence of tRNACys and alanine; Ala-tRNACys has been synthesized by the reductive desulfurization of Cys-tRNACys and has been found to be relatively resistant to the enzyme-catalyzed deacylation. Part of the high selectivity of the enzyme for the -SH group of cysteine (approximately 5 kcal/mol) appears to be caused by dispersion forces: simple calculations suggest that the dispersion energy between sulfur and a methylene group is about 2.5 times greater than that between two methylene groups. This high "hydrophobicity" of sulfur is consistent with the relative binding energies of substrates of the methionyl-tRNA synthetase. The rest of the high binding energy of the-SH group may come from hydrogen bonding.
Document 12 (Title: Cell_Biology_Alberts): Figure 2–22 lowering the activation energy greatly increases the probability of a reaction. at any given instant, a population of identical substrate molecules will have a range of energies, distributed as shown on the graph. The varying energies come from collisions with surrounding molecules, which make the substrate molecules jiggle, vibrate, and spin. for a molecule to undergo a chemical reaction, the energy of the molecule must exceed the activation-energy barrier for that reaction (dashed lines). for most biological reactions, this almost never happens without enzyme catalysis. even with enzyme catalysis, the substrate molecules must experience a particularly energetic collision to react (red shaded area). Raising the temperature will also increase the number of molecules with sufficient energy to overcome the activation energy needed for a reaction; but in marked contrast to enzyme catalysis, this effect is nonselective, speeding up all reactions (Movie 2.2).
Document 13 (Title: Active site): Each active site is evolved to be optimised to bind a particular substrate and catalyse a particular reaction, resulting in high specificity. This specificity is determined by the arrangement of amino acids within the active site and the structure of the substrates. Sometimes enzymes also need to bind with some cofactors to fulfil their function. The active site is usually a groove or pocket of the enzyme which can be located in a deep tunnel within the enzyme, or between the interfaces of multimeric enzymes. An active site can catalyse a reaction repeatedly as residues are not altered at the end of the reaction (they may change during the reaction, but are regenerated by the end). This process is achieved by lowering the activation energy of the reaction, so more substrates have enough energy to undergo reaction. Binding site
Document 14 (Title: Energy changes during the formation and interconversion of enzyme-substrate complexes.): The rate constants and equilibrium constants of the individual steps of several enzyme reactions may be determined by the application of rapid reaction methods and isotope techniques. This makes it possible to complement the formalism of the Haldane relation with details of the reaction mechanism. It has been shown that, in several enzyme reactions, steps involving chemical catalysis are fast and have small free-energy changes compared with those of the substrate binding and product dissociation processes. Data are presented in this paper for three enzyme reactions for which different methods have been used to elucidate the kinetic parameters of the elementary steps. For cardiac lactate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.27), absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy have been used to distinguish the step involved in the chemical process from those involved in the formation of the substrate complex and the release of the product. The rate of interconversion between enzyme-bound substrates and products is fast compared with other steps and the equilibrium constant for the process is near unity. Consequently, the difference of standard free energy changes for the formation of the two ternary complexes correspons approximately to the overall free-energy change of the hydrogen transfer reaction. Isotope kinetic techniques can be used to study the reactions of triosephosphate isomerase (EC 5.3.1.1). With this enzyme, the interconversion of enzyme-bound substrate into product is comparable in rate to product dissociation. The reactions of myosin subfragment 1 with ATP, studied by fluorescence spectroscopy and chemical quenching, follow a similar pattern in that the equilibrium constant of the chemical step in which water reacts with protein-bound ATP is 9. In this case, however, there is a remarkably large free-energy change associated with a first-order process involved in the binding of ATP. The possible significance of these results to energy transduction in muscle contraction as well as in the biosynthesis of ATP is discussed.
Document 15 (Title: Biochemistry_Lippinco): E. Regulation Enzyme activity can be regulated, that is, increased or decreased, so that the rate of product formation responds to cellular need. F. Location within the cell Many enzymes are localized in specific organelles within the cell (Fig. 5.3). Such compartmentalization serves to isolate the reaction substrate or product from other competing reactions. This provides a favorable environment for the reaction and organizes the thousands of enzymes present in the cell into purposeful pathways. IV. MECHANISM OF ENZYME ACTION The mechanism of enzyme action can be viewed from two different perspectives. The first treats catalysis in terms of energy changes that occur during the reaction. That is, enzymes provide an alternate, energetically favorable reaction pathway different from the uncatalyzed reaction. The second perspective describes how the active site chemically facilitates catalysis. A. Energy changes occurring during the reaction
