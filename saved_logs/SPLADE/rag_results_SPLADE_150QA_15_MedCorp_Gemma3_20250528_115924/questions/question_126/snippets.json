        "title": "Cefpodoxime proxetil. A review of its antibacterial activity, pharmacokinetic properties and therapeutic potential.",
        "content": "Cefpodoxime proxetil is an orally administered prodrug which is absorbed and de-esterified by the intestinal mucosa to release the third generation cephalosporin, cefpodoxime. Cefpodoxime is stable towards the most commonly found plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases and the drug has a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity encompassing both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, rendering it a possible option for empirical use in a wide range of community acquired infections in both adult and paediatric patients. The extended plasma half-life of cefpodoxime (1.9 to 3.7 h) permits twice daily administration. In comparative trials, twice daily cefpodoxime proxetil (dose equivalent cefpodoxime 100 to 400 mg) was as effective as a 3- to 4-times daily regimen of phenoxymethylpenicillin in pharyngotonsillitis, as well as thrice daily amoxicillin (with or without clavulanic acid) or cefaclor against infections of the ear, the upper and lower respiratory tract, the urinary tract and those of the skin and soft tissues. The latter reflects the enhanced antistaphylococcal activity of cefpodoxime, which distinguishes it from other orally active third generation cephalosporins such as cefixime. Most notably, an oral regimen of cefpodoxime proxetil was as efficacious as parenterally administered ceftriaxone for the treatment of bronchopneumonia in hospitalised patients at risk due to the presence of underlying diseases, addictions or advancing age. A single oral dose of cefpodoxime was also as efficacious as ceftriaxone in uncomplicated anogenital gonococcal infections. Cefpodoxime proxetil is generally well tolerated, with mild to moderate gastrointestinal disturbances occurring in 4 to 15% of patients treated with therapeutic doses. Thus, a convenient twice daily oral regimen of cefpodoxime proxetil can be prescribed as an effective alternative to established beta-lactam therapies in the empirical outpatient treatment of infections of the respiratory and urinary tracts as well as those of the skin and soft tissues.",

Pertinent literature published between 1988 and the present was identified via a MEDLINE search. Of 77 articles retrieved, 37 have been referenced. Azithromycin is a new agent, and as such, limited data regarding this drug are available in the literature. We evaluated all pharmacokinetic, microbiologic, and basic science articles pertaining to azithromycin, and reviewed the clinical efficacy trials that we believed were of good quality for each indication for which azithromycin has received approval to date. Comparative clinical trials involving large numbers of patients, clinical outcome assessments, and recommendations for azithromycin use are included. Azithromycin is a macrolide derivative and the first of the 15-membered ring azalide class of antimicrobials. Although its mechanism of action and susceptibility to resistance are similar to those of the macrolide antibiotics, azithromycin's extended spectrum of activity includes gram-positive and gram-negative organisms, as well as atypical pathogens. Azithromycin is stable at gastric pH and has an absolute bioavailability of approximately 37 percent following oral administration. Although its serum concentrations are typically low, the drug concentrates to a high degree in tissue. Azithromycin is cleared primarily by the biliary and fecal routes; its serum half-life is in excess of 60 hours. Several clinical trials have proven that a 5-day course of azithromycin administered once a day is equally efficacious to a 7- to 14-day course of other commonly used oral antimicrobials, administered two to four times a day, for the treatment of upper and lower respiratory tract and skin and skin-structure infections. Urethritis and cervicitis caused by chlamydia are treated with a single 1-g dose. Trials have shown azithromycin's adverse-effect profile to be equal or even superior to that of other agents, with only 0.7 percent of patients discontinuing therapy versus 2.6 percent for comparable drugs. Azithromycin represents a significant improvement in the treatment of selected community-acquired infections. Although this agent may revolutionize the treatment of sexually transmitted diseases caused by chlamydia, it also should impact the management of respiratory tract and skin and skin-structure infections. Because of its unique pharmacokinetics and excellent adverse-effect profile, patient compliance should be greatly enhanced compared with other commonly used oral antimicrobials. Azithromycin's primary role in the near future will be in the community setting. Although its use in the hospital may be limited, this drug will be a convenient therapeutic option to have on hand in the emergency room and outpatient clinic.

It undergoes hepatic metabolism, and the major metabolite, desethylamiodarone, is bioactive. The elimination half-life is complex, with a rapid component of 3\u201310 days (50% of the drug) and a slower component of several weeks. After discontinuation of the drug, effects are maintained for 1\u20133 months. Measurable tissue levels may be observed up to 1 year after discontinuation. A total loading dose of 10 g is usually achieved with 0.8\u20131.2 g daily doses. The maintenance dose is 200\u2013400 mg daily. Pharmacologic effects may be achieved rapidly by intravenous loading. QT-prolonging effect is modest with this route of administration, whereas bradycardia and AV block may be significant."

        "content": "The half-lives of these drugs and the necessary dosing intervals vary greatly: ceftriaxone (half-life 7\u20138 hours) can be injected once every 24 hours at a dosage of 15\u201350 mg/kg/d. A single daily 1-g dose is sufficient for most serious infections, with 2 g every 12 hours recommended for treatment of meningitis and 2 g every 24 hours recommended for endocarditis. The remaining drugs in the group (half-life 1\u20131.7 hours) can be infused every 6\u20138 hours in dosages between 2 and 12 g/d, depending on the severity of infection. Cefixime can be given orally (200 mg twice daily or 400 mg once daily) for urinary tract infections. Due to increasing resistance, cefixime is no longer recommended for the treatment of uncomplicated gonococcal urethritis and cervicitis. Intramuscular ceftriaxone in combination with azithromycin is the regimen of choice for treating most gonococcal infections. The adult dose for cefpodoxime proxetil or cefditoren pivoxil is 200\u2013400 mg twice daily; for ceftibuten, 400 mg",

        "content": "Ceftriaxone is a third-generation cephalosporin that exhibits saturable plasma protein binding, which influences its pharmacokinetic parameters depending on the dose. Systemic clearance and volume of distribution of total drug show dependence on both concentration and time, whereas for unbound drug these parameters remain constant. The decrease in renal or non-renal clearance with age or in the presence of disease states is often compensated by the concurrent increase in free fraction, resulting in no apparent changes in half-life and no need for dose adjustment. Because of its unusually long plasma half-life, the availability of intramuscular administration and its high intrinsic activity against many organisms, ceftriaxone has become a popular agent in once-daily therapy of infections in paediatric patients, gonococcal infections and outpatient management of pneumonia and osteomyelitis.",
