With your own knowledge and the help of the following document:

Document 1 (Title: The risk factors of age and family history and their relationship to screening mammography utilization.): To study the association of two well known risk factors for breast cancer and the association of knowledge of those risk factors with mammography utilization. Cross sectional: two independent random telephone surveys. Two Northeastern metropolitan communities surveyed in 1987 and in 1989. Women without breast cancer who spoke English and who were between 45 and 75 years of age. The two risk factors measured were a family history of breast cancer and being 65 or older. Participants were surveyed about their knowledge of risk factors, presence of risk factors, selected beliefs, attitudes, reinforcing factors and mammography use. Results were analyzed for women 50-75. There was a substantial increase in mammography use over the 2-year period. Having a positive family history or being older is not associated with increased mammography utilization. Knowledge that family history and/or age are risks is associated with increased utilization. However, knowledge of risk factors is not associated with having those risks. Older women have lower utilization than younger women regardless of their knowledge of age as a risk. Increased physician recommendation is associated with increased utilization. Since knowing that a factor is a risk and having a physician recommend mammography are each associated with increased use, we conclude that the primary care physicians' role in increasing mammography utilization is critical.
Document 2 (Title: Differential diagnosis): For an individual (who becomes the "patient" in this example), a blood test of, for example, serum calcium shows a result above the standard reference range, which, by most definitions, classifies as hypercalcemia, which becomes the "presentation" in this case. A clinician (who becomes the "diagnostician" in this example), who does not currently see the patient, gets to know about his finding. By practical reasons, the clinician considers that there is enough test indication to have a look at the patient's medical records. For simplicity, let's say that the only information given in the medical records is a family history of primary hyperparathyroidism (here abbreviated as PH), which may explain the finding of hypercalcemia. For this patient, let's say that the resultant hereditary risk factor is estimated to confer a relative risk of 10 (RRPH = 10).
Document 3 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Additional variables that should be documented are nonhereditary risk factors among those with disease (such as cigarette smoking and myocardial infarction; asbestos exposure and lung disease; and mantle radiation and breast cancer). Significant associated environmental exposures or lifestyle factors decrease the likelihood of a specific genetic disorder. In contrast, the absence of nonhereditary risk factors typically associated with a disease raises concern about a genetic association. A personal or family history of deep vein thrombosis in the absence of known environmental or medical risk factors suggests a hereditary thrombotic disorder. The physical examination may also provide important clues about the risk for a specific inherited disorder. A patient presenting with xanthomas at a young age should prompt consideration of familial hypercholesterolemia. The presence of trichilemmomas in a woman with breast cancer raises concern for Cowden syndrome, associated with PTEN
Document 4 (Title: Testicular Teratoma -- Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes): Interprofessional communication between a primary care physician, urologists, radiologists, pathologists, oncologists, pharmacists, nurses, and laboratory personnel is necessary for professionals to effectively treat testicular teratoma. Patients with increased risk for developing testicular cancer, including positive family history, cryptorchidism, and testicular atrophy, should be informed and trained accordingly. Primary care physicians hold clinical information and the family history of the patient. Therefore they should provide all significant information to carefully identify the high-risk patient, reassure and counsel the patient during all the course of the disease, and schedule checkups. Continuous support must entail not only from the medical staff but also from close family members and friends.
Document 5 (Title: Family care of the elderly and caregiver stress.): Contrary to the widespread belief that most elderly persons are institutionalized, 95 percent of people over age 65 live at home, and many are cared for, to some extent, by a relative. It has only recently been recognized that the family caregiver is at risk for increased physical and mental morbidity because of this often stressful task. If the situation is too stressful, elder abuse may result. Family physicians are in a good position to identify caregiver stress, recognize the danger signs of elder abuse, provide support, education and advice, and intervene when necessary. Primary care providers should routinely ask about caregiving responsibilities when obtaining the medical history of any patient over age 45.
Document 6 (Title: Concierge medicine): History The concierge medicine model, although not the term, originated with MD² International, which was founded in 1996 in Seattle by Dr. Howard Maron and Dr. Scott Hall. At the time, Maron was physician for the Seattle SuperSonics sports team, and sought to provide luxury primary care services similar to what he had been providing these athletes. MD²'s model included physician patient loads of 50 families, dramatically reduced compared with the conventional American patient load of about 3,000 patients per year. Advantages include very quick access to your personal physician as needed, and the ability to see doctors in any of 10 major cities at a greatly increased cost. MD² clients have insurance to cover additional services beyond primary care, but MD²'s fees cover the full costs of their services and MD² does not bill insurance.
Document 7 (Title: Suicide Risk -- Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes): The only way to prevent suicides is to work in an interprofessional team that includes a mental health nurse, psychiatrist, primary care provider, social worker, and nurse practitioner. Practitioners must work with the patient's family and friends, as well as with the other patients who knew the deceased. The first step is to prevent harm to the patient and, secondly, treat the cause of the behavior that is causing suicidal ideations. All patients with suicidal ideations should be closely monitored. The family should be educated about the potential signs of danger. Unfortunately, in many cases, the healthcare system does fail, as many patients go on to end their lives. [21] [Level 5]
Document 8 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): The expansion of knowledge related to genetics is changing our understanding of pathophysiology and influencing our classification of diseases. Awareness of genetic etiology can have an impact on clinical management, including prevention and screening for or treatment of a range of diseases. Primary care physicians are relied upon to help patients navigate testing and treatment options. Consequently, they must understand the genetic basis for a large number of genetically influenced diseases, incorporate personal and family history to determine the risk for a specific mutation, and be positioned to provide counseling. Even if patients are seen by genetic specialists who assess genetic risk and coordinate testing, primary care providers should provide information to their patients regarding the indications, limitations, risks, and benefits of genetic counseling and testing. They must also be prepared to offer risk-based management following genetic risk assessment. Given the pace of
Document 9 (Title: Bisphosphonate Related Jaw Osteonecrosis -- Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes): Prompt recognition of osteonecrosis by the interprofessional team is important for improving outcomes. Prescribing providers include primary care providers, dentists, orthopedists, rheumatologists, and oncologists. Pharmacists provided education to patients and their families, monitor compliance, and provide feedback to the team. Specialty care nurses, including infusion nurses, orthopedic nurses, and otolaryngology, provide education, monitor patients, and inform the team about status changes or issues. Good communication among the team, patient education, appropriate preventive measures, and treatment aimed at pain and infection control can enhance the patient care outcomes for patients on bisphosphonates who are at the risk of developing or having established osteonecrosis of the jaw. [Level 5]
Document 10 (Title: Familial Combined Hyperlipidemia -- Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes): As part of preventive care, the primary care team should conduct lipid screening to evaluate serum cholesterol levels in accordance with the guidelines provided by the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF). Additionally, they should assess contributing risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD) and myocardial infarction, such as hypertension and diabetes. Earlier screening and diagnostic assessments may be warranted in patients at higher risk or with a family history of FCH. Comprehensive patient history should also be obtained, focusing on familial dyslipidemias or family history of heart disease.
Document 11 (Title: Primary care): The International Classification of Primary Care (ICPC) is a standardized tool for understanding and analyzing information on interventions in primary care by the reason for the patient visit. Common chronic illnesses usually treated in primary care may include, for example: hypertension, angina, diabetes, asthma, COPD, depression and anxiety, back pain, arthritis or thyroid dysfunction. Primary care also includes many basic maternal and child health care services, such as family planning services and vaccinations. In context of global population ageing, with increasing numbers of older adults at greater risk of chronic non-communicable diseases, rapidly increasing demand for primary care services is expected around the world, in both developed and developing countries.
Document 12 (Title: Gynecology_Novak): breast cancer, whereas women with proliferative breast disease and no atypical hyperplasia had a twofold higher risk of breast cancer. Patients whose biopsy results showed atypical ductal or lobular hyperplasia had an approximately fivefold higher risk than women with nonproliferative disease to develop invasive breast cancer in either breast. Patients with carcinoma in situ have an eight-to tenfold risk of developing breast cancer. This risk is bilateral for lobular lesions and ipsilateral for ductal lesions. A family history of breast cancer added little risk for women with nonproliferative disease, but family history plus atypia increased breast cancer risk 11-fold. The presence of cysts alone did not increase the risk of breast cancer, but cysts combined with a family history of breast cancer increased the risk about threefold (76,92–97). Women with these risk factors (family history of breast cancer and proliferative breast disease) should be followed carefully with physical
Document 13 (Title: Wilms Tumor -- Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes): Wilms tumors are still relatively rare, but survival for most patients is quite good, especially for those with "favorable" histology who are diagnosed early and receive proper treatment. The majority of patients first present to the pediatrician, nurse practitioner, or primary care provider. These clinicians need to be vigilant about infants with abdominal pain as the cause may be Wilms tumor. The key to improved survival is a prompt referral to the oncologist. Because the diagnosis is often devastating to the families, a mental health nurse should provide counseling in concert with the clinician. The pharmacist should educate the family about the chemotherapeutic medications and their adverse effects. The oncology nurse should educate the family on the surgery, the post-operative care, and follow up as well as assist the clinician in monitoring the patient and providing regular follow-up.
Document 14 (Title: Melanoma): Other mutations confer lower risk, but are more common in the population. People with mutations in the MC1R gene are two to four times more likely to develop melanoma than those with two wild-type (typical unaffected type) copies. MC1R mutations are very common, and all red-haired people have a mutated copy. Mutation of the MDM2 SNP309 gene is associated with increased risks for younger women. Fair- and red-haired people, persons with multiple atypical nevi or dysplastic nevi and persons born with giant congenital melanocytic nevi are at increased risk. A family history of melanoma greatly increases a person's risk, because mutations in several genes have been found in melanoma-prone families. People with a history of one melanoma are at increased risk of developing a second primary tumor. Fair skin is the result of having less melanin in the skin, which means less protection from UV radiation exists. A family history could indicate a genetic predisposition to melanoma.
Document 15 (Title: Colon cancer genetics.): The terms "hereditary," "sporadic," and "familial" colorectal cancer (CRC) suggest a knowledge of causation; however, current understanding of CRC does not permit categorization of differing CRC risks in accord with their cause per se. Despite these serious shortcomings, these terms are defined operationally on the basis of a family history of cancer, and when available, additional phenotypic information. The sporadic type occurs in the absence of a family history of CRC in a first-degree relative. The familial type occurs when at least one first-degree relative has CRC. Both these categories require the exclusion of hereditary CRC. In the case of hereditary CRC, this type is defined as a family history of CRC occurring in a pattern that indicates autosomal-dominant inheritance, which also may involve certain phenotypic signs (depending on the specific disorder, i.e., florid adenomatous polyps, benign and malignant extracolonic lesions, cancer of unusually early onset, and multiple primary cancer, particularly synchronous and metachronous CRC). Although this operational classification does not produce etiologically homogeneous groups, it is believed to have pragmatic utility with respect to planning targeted surveillance and management strategies. Because of the distinctive natural history of CRC in hereditary syndromes, it is of paramount clinical importance to identify hereditary CRC when it does occur. Even in patients with no evidence of hereditary CRC syndrome, their family history may be second only to age in determining the best CRC screening program for those who are asymptomatic. In an attempt to provide a perspective on the clinical evaluation of CRC risk, research was reviewed on pathologic features and biomarkers that may be related to CRC causes, especially the genetic basis of CRC susceptibility. The long-term objective of studies on the genetic epidemiology of CRC is primary and secondary prevention through development of targeted management and surveillance recommendations (based on an understanding of CRC causation) that is relevant to hereditary, familial, and sporadic CRC.
