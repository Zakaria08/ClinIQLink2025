Cholesterol is transported mainly by low (LDLs) and high (HDLs) density lipoproteins.

Plasma levels of very low density lipoproteins (VLDLs) are probably not an independent risk factor, and the situation for plasma triglycerides is unclear. beta-Blockers have no significant effects on plasma concentrations of either total or LDL cholesterol, but HDL plasma concentration is reduced by about 10%, particularly by nonselective beta-blockers. Plasma triglyceride and VLDL concentrations are both raised by beta-blockade.

        "contents": "Fibrinogen -- Administration. It is a concentrate of\u00a0high-molecular-weight\u00a0plasma proteins prepared by the thawing of FFP. It contains fibrinogen, factor\u00a0VIII, VWF, factor XIII,\u00a0and\u00a0fibronectin. Each unit of 10-20 ml contains approximately 200-250 mg of fibrinogen. [1] One unit raises plasma fibrinogen levels by 7\u00a0to 10 mg/dL. The\u00a0average\u00a0half-life\u00a0is approximately four days.\u00a0Infusion must be through a\u00a0filter\u00a0with\u00a0a rate\u00a0of\u00a0at least\u00a0200ml/hour. The dose for\u00a0minor and\u00a0severe bleeding is 1 unit per 5 kg and 10kg of body weight, respectively. The administration of the repeat dose is by checking the plasma fibrinogen level at appropriate\u00a0intervals.
