He walked after his injury and 10 minutes later presented dizziness, cough and tachycardia. On admission a minor haemothorax was seen on a chest X ray, but the bullet was not seen. Even without symptoms, an X ray of abdomen showed the missile lying above the left sacroiliac joint. A chest tube was placed, the patient had an excellent recovery and was discharged a week later. After several months he presented hemoptysis and a moderate pain on his right chest and was treated as an acute bronchitis. Six months after his initial injury he developed a florid picture of acute pulmonary embolism (chest pain, dyspnea, hemoptysis, tachycardia, severe cough). A new chest X ray was done and the bullet was shown lying in the right chest. A pulmonary arteriography located it in a lower basal branch. Through a posterolateral thoracotomy the slug was obtained.

This is due to the transfer of referred pain signals from the lower thoracic splanchnic nerves to the lumbar splanchnic nerves as the stone passes down from the kidney or proximal ureter to the distal ureter. This pain, known as renal colic, is often described as one of the strongest pain sensations known. Renal colic caused by kidney stones is commonly accompanied by urinary urgency, restlessness, hematuria, sweating, nausea, and vomiting. It typically comes in waves lasting 20 to 60 minutes caused by peristaltic contractions of the ureter as it attempts to expel the stone.",

        "content": "We reported a rare case of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of iliac bone which developed peripheral blood involvement associated with hypercalcemia. 42-year-old man was admitted to Fukui Medical School Hospital because of right iliac bone pain. An X-ray film of the pelvis disclosed the osteolytic change of right iliac bone. A CT scan of the pelvis showed soft tissue density tumors involved bilateral iliac bone. He had no superficial lymphadenopathy or organomegaly. Examination of peripheral blood and bone marrow did not show any abnormalities. Monoclonal immunoglobulin was not detected in serum. Examination of biopsied specimens from iliac bone tumor showed infiltration of round cells. Immunocytochemical analysis showed only MT-1 positive. He was treated with combination chemotherapy of vindesine, cyclophosphamide, prednisolone and pirarubicin followed by radiation therapy. But, there was no significant response. Following radiation therapy, he developed coma. Serum calcium was 9.8 mEq/l. The pathologic immature cells were found in peripheral blood. The bone marrow aspirates showed 63% pathologic cells. These cells expressed CD19, CD20, HLA-DR antigens. He was diagnosed as having leukemic non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, B-cell type, and was treated with combination chemotherapy. But he died of systemic fungal infection.",

        "content": "Signs and symptoms Signs and symptoms of acute pyelonephritis generally develop rapidly over a few hours or a day. It can cause high fever, pain on passing urine, and abdominal pain that radiates along the flank towards the back. There is often associated vomiting. Chronic pyelonephritis causes persistent flank or abdominal pain, signs of infection (fever, unintentional weight loss, malaise, decreased appetite), lower urinary tract symptoms and blood in the urine. Chronic pyelonephritis can in addition cause fever of unknown origin. Furthermore, inflammation-related proteins can accumulate in organs and cause the condition AA amyloidosis. Physical examination may reveal fever and tenderness at the costovertebral angle on the affected side.",
