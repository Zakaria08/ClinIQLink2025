Neurologic, infectious, inflammatory, neoplastic, congenital, traumatic, and behavioral factors should all be considered in a patient with dysphonia. However, certain conditions may more closely mimic the presentation of Reinke edema. These conditions include acute and chronic laryngitis, benign and malignant tumors such as papilloma or squamous cell carcinoma, unilateral or bilateral vocal cord paresis or paralysis, presbyphonia, phonotraumatic lesions such as vocal fold nodules or hemorrhagic polyps, or functional dysphonia such as\u00a0that seen in muscle tension dysphonia.

        "content": "Since 1987, the authors have used a new technique for the augmentation and medialization of the paralyzed vocal cord. Eleven patients with paralyzed vocal cords and one patient with a surgical defect of the vocal cord have been treated with intracordal injections of autogenous fat harvested by suction from the abdominal wall. Treatment efficacy was evaluated by both subjective and objective (videostroboscopic) analyses. Patient follow-up has ranged from 5 to 42 months. All patients showed significant improvement in voice characteristics. Marked reduction in air flow and increased vocal intensity were observed. Correction of glottic insufficiency has been lasting, indicating that the implanted fat cells are viable. At this time, there has been no evidence of loss of vocal cord substance. The natural qualities of autogenous fat appear to make it an excellent alternative to Teflon or collagen. The fat is readily available, and easily harvested and injected. A larger patient population and longer follow-up periods will help determine if these initial findings are consistent.",

        "content": "Phonation, or the production of vocal sounds, is a function of the larynx, more particularly the vocal cords. The pitch of the speaking or singing voice depends upon the length and mass of the membranous parts of the vocal cords and can be varied by changing their tension; this is accomplished by means of the intrinsic laryngeal muscles, before any audible sound emerges. The controlled intratracheal pressure forces air past the glottis and separates the margins of the cords, setting up a series of vibrations and recoils. Sounds thus formed are modulated as they pass through the nasopharynx and mouth, which act as resonators. Articulation consists of contractions of the pharynx, palate, tongue, and lips, which interrupt or alter the vocal sounds. Vowels are of laryngeal origin, as are some consonants, but the latter are formed for the most part during articulation; the consonants m, b, and p are labial, l and t are lingual, and nk and ng are guttural (throat and soft palate).",
