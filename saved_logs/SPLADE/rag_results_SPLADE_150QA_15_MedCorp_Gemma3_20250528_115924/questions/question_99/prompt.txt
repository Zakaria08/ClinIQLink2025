Document 1 (Title: Hormone Replacement Therapy -- Indications -- Testosterone therapy indications): The addition of testosterone supplementation to menopausal HRT can be beneficial for women with female sexual interest and arousal disorder after other causes have been excluded and a trial of conventional HRT has been given. Currently, no FDA-approved testosterone product for women in the US is available. However, transdermal testosterone therapy at a dose suitable for postmenopausal women may enhance sexual desire, arousal, orgasm, and overall pleasure, keeping in mind that no specific level of any androgen is diagnostic of hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD). Per the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition ( DSM-5 ), published in 2022, HSDD is included in and referred to as female sexual arousal and interest disorder (FSAID). [16] Testosterone gel or cream formulations should be applied to clean, dry skin on the lower abdomen or upper thighs. The hands should be washed immediately after application, and contact with others should be avoided until the product is completely dry. The area should not be washed for 2 to 3 hours postapplication. [8] [17]
Document 2 (Title: Sexual dysfunction in patients with hypothalamo-pituitary disorders.): Four different studies of sexual problems and sexual dysfunction in patients with hypothalamo-pituitary disorders have been undertaken and data about the sex life of the patients have been correlated with diagnosis, tumour extension and pathology, endocrine insufficiency and pituitary hormone hypersecretion. In the first study 48 out of 53 (76.2%) adult males with pituitary tumours reported decreased or absent sexual desire. The corresponding figure in the second study was 29 out of 37 (78.4%) among adult males with pituitary tumours and hyperprolactinaemia. Twenty (31.7%) and 18 (48.6%) patients, respectively, reported decreased sexual desire as the first symptom of their tumour. A highly significant correlation between a decrease in serum testosterone and a decrease in sexual desire was found. Some males with normal serum testosterone but hyperprolactinaemia also reported decreased sexual desire. In the third study, 109 females (aged 20-60) with morphologically verified hypothalamo-pituitary disorders, 68 (62.4%) had noticed a decrease in sexual desire. This problem was registered for 53 (84.1%) out of the 63 women in this group who had hyperprolactinaemia but only in 15 (32.6%) out of the 46 women with normal serum prolactin (p less than 0.001). In the last study 48 women with well-defined hypothalamo-pituitary disorders underwent a comprehensive interview about sexual function and sexual appreciation. Thirty-eight (79.2%) of the women had developed a lack of or a considerable decrease in sexual desire. Problems with lubrication or orgasms were reported by 31 (64.6%) and 33 (68.7%) of the women, respectively. Preservation of normal menstrual pattern, age, and intrasellar tumour growth was correlated to normal sexual desire and function.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Document 3 (Title: Sexual desire): Hormones Sexual desire is said to be influenced by androgens in men and by both androgens and estrogens in women. Many studies associate the sex hormone testosterone with sexual desire. Another hormone thought to influence sexual desire is oxytocin. Exogenous administration of moderate amounts of oxytocin has been found to stimulate females to desire and seek out sexual activity. In women, oxytocin levels are at their highest during sexual activity. In males, the frequency of ejaculation affects libido. If roughly a week passes between ejaculations, there will be a stronger desire for sexual activity. Interventions Medical interventions are available for individuals who feel sexually bored, experience performance anxiety, or are unable to orgasm. For everyday life, a 2013 fact sheet from the Association for Reproductive Health Professionals recommends erotic literature and recalling instances when one felt sexy and sexual.

Document 4 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): The female sexual response requires the presence of estrogens. A role for androgens is also likely but less well established. In the CNS, estrogens and androgens work synergistically to enhance sexual arousal and response. A number of studies report enhanced libido in women during preovulatory phases of the menstrual cycle, suggesting that hormones involved in the ovulatory surge (e.g., estrogens) increase desire. Sexual motivation is heavily influenced by context, including the environment and partner factors. Once sufficient sexual desire is reached, sexual arousal is mediated by the central and autonomic nervous systems. Cerebral sympathetic outflow is thought to increase desire, and peripheral parasympathetic activity results in clitoral vasocongestion and vaginal secretion (lubrication).
Document 5 (Title: Sexual desire): In women, anticoagulants, cardiovascular medications, statins, and anti-hypertension drugs contribute to low levels of desire. However, in men, only anticoagulants and anti-hypertension medications have been found to be related. Oral contraceptives can also lower sexual desire in as many as one in four women who use them. They are known to increase levels of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) in the body, and high SHBG levels are in turn associated with a decline in desire. Though it is not used as medication, the drug methamphetamine has a strong positive effect on many aspects of sexual behaviour, including desire. Hormones Sexual desire is said to be influenced by androgens in men and by both androgens and estrogens in women.
Document 6 (Title: Low sexual desire in women: the role of reproductive hormones.): The role of reproductive hormones in mediating sexual desire in healthy women is still unclear. Elucidation was sought in this study by comparing the hormonal milieu of two groups of subjects with markedly different levels of sexual desire. Seventeen women ages 27-39 who met DSM III-R criteria for severe, persistent, and generalized loss of desire (hypoactive sexual desire disorder, HSD), but had no other current psychological or medical problem, were compared to 13 healthy, sexually active women. All subjects and spouses were interviewed extensively to determine the women's sexual desire and responsiveness. Blood samples were drawn every 3 to 4 days for one menstrual cycle and were analyzed by RIA for testosterone, SHBG, estradiol, progesterone, prolactin, and luteinizing hormone. Results indicated that the HSD women's gonadal hormones fluctuated normally over the menstrual cycle, were within normal limits for each cycle phase, and were never significantly different from those of controls. Neither testosterone, non-SHBG bound testosterone, nor prolactin differentiated between the HSD women with the most and least severe HSD parameters (e.g., frequency of fantasy, masturbation, or female-initiated coitus), nor between women with lifelong and acquired HSD. The present findings did not provide evidence that reproductive hormones are important determinants of individual differences in the sexual desire of these eugonadal women.
Document 7 (Title: Female Sexual Interest and Arousal Disorder -- Evaluation -- Interpretation of the DSDS Screen Results): According to DSM-V , the duration of symptoms should be at least 6 months. [35] In addition, the DSM-V removes the prerequisite of a patient having "desire" dysfunction as a condition for diagnosing female sexual dysfunction. However, this distinction is limited to women. [5] Instead of "desire," the DSM-V substituted "interest" and replaced both HSDD and female sexual arousal disorder with the consolidated diagnosis of FSIAD. [5] [6] The definition and assessment of desire have been significant points of contention in diagnosing FSIAD. [35] Women's perception of desire is influenced by various factors such as emotional, psychological, cognitive, and interpersonal elements. Notably, the desire for sex may not always be the primary motivation for women to engage in sexual activity. [35] Many women have reported participating in sexual intercourse for reasons beyond desire, such as feeling obligated to satisfy their partner's needs, for emotional connection, or in exchange for nonsexual favors.
Document 8 (Title: Sexual desire, general arousability, and sexual dysfunction.): To determine the interrelationships among neuroticism, general arousability, sexual desire, and sexual dysfunction in women, two studies were conducted. The first found a significant positive correlation between general arousability and neuroticism. The second found a curvilinear relationship between general arousability and sexual dysfunction, and a negative correlation between levels of sexual desire and sexual dysfunction. Implications for therapy with sexually dysfunctional women are discussed.
Document 9 (Title: Libido): Sexual desire disorders A sexual desire disorder is more common in women than in men, and women tend to exhibit less frequent and less intense sexual desires than men. Erectile dysfunction may happen to the penis because of lack of sexual desire, but these two should not be confused. For example, large recreational doses of amphetamine or methamphetamine can simultaneously cause erectile dysfunction and significantly increase libido. However, men can also experience a decrease in their libido as they age. The American Medical Association has estimated that several million US women suffer from a female sexual arousal disorder, though arousal is not at all synonymous with desire, so this finding is of limited relevance to the discussion of libido. Some specialists claim that women may experience low libido due to some hormonal abnormalities such as lack of luteinising hormone or androgenic hormones, although these theories are still controversial.

Document 10 (Title: Postmenopausal sexuality in Thai women.): We evaluate sexuality in 100 natural menopausal women as pertains to hormones, symptoms related to intercourse, and marital relationship with sexual desire, orgasm and coital frequency. The mean age was 56.8 years while menopausal age was 50.3 years. The postmenopausal syndrome presented 55.0% occurring 1 to 7 years after menopause (mean 3.4 years). The common sexual problems after menopause were loss of libido, orgasmic dysfunction, and dyspareunia. Both sexual desire and activity decreased when compared with premenopausal period. Ninety percent of the subjects had sexual desire less than once a month. Only 14% of the subjects occasionally reached orgasm while the other 86% never had orgasm after menopause. The levels of FSH, LH, estradiol and testosterone were also reported. There was no correlation of hormone estradiol and testosterone, symptoms related to intercourse and marital relationship with sexual desire, orgasm, or coital frequency.
Document 11 (Title: Gynecology_Novak): Sexual Response Cycle Sexual response reﬂects the fundamental interplay between the mind and body: psychological, interpersonal, cultural, environmental, and biological (hormonal, vascular, muscular, neurological) factors interact and modulate sexual experience. The initial phase of the sexual response cycle may be one of desire, but more often women, particularly those in long-term relationships, are motivated by factors other than sexual desire (3). Women initiate or consent to sex for many reasons, including a wish to increase emotional intimacy with their partners. By directing her attention to sexual stimulation, a woman’s subjective sexual arousal/pleasure/excitement triggers sexual desire. Desire and arousal coexist and compound each other (Fig. 11.1). Sexual satisfaction (with one, many, or no orgasms) can be achieved if a woman can stay focused, her pleasure continues, the duration of the stimulation is sufficiently long, and there is no negative outcome (e.g., pain or
Document 12 (Title: Gynecology_Novak): Adrenal production of testosterone precursors gradually decreases with age, beginning in the late 30s. Large epidemiological studies have not shown serum levels of testosterone to correlate with women’s sexual function (48,49). Available assays were not sufficiently sensitive in the female range of serum testosterone to detect particularly low levels. When mass spectroscopy was used: serum testosterone levels were similar in 121 women carefully assessed and diagnosed with disorders of low desire and arousability to levels in 125 women similarly carefully assessed but to exclude any sexual dysfunction (50). A second difficulty, over and beyond the unreliable assays for serum testosterone, was the fact that intercellular production of testosterone in peripheral tissues (from adrenal and ovarian) precursor hormones—DHEA, DHEA sulfate (DHEAS), and androstenedione (A4)—previously could not be measured. Total testosterone activity (ovarian and peripherally produced “intracrine production”)
Document 13 (Title: Flibanserin -- Indications): Sexual dysfunction affects approximately 50% of women in the United States. Among the various factors contributing to sexual dysfunction in women, hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) is the most commonly identified cause. HSDD is characterized by limited or absent sexual fantasies or desires, resulting in interpersonal strain or heightened distress, which persist for a minimum of 6 months. [1] [2] The diagnosis of this condition is unrelated to relationship issues, psychiatric or medical conditions, or the effects of medication or drugs. Although the exact physiological causes of HSDD remain inconclusive, a hypothesis suggests that HSDD may be influenced by neurotransmitter function and hormonal levels. [2]
Document 14 (Title: Gynecology_Novak): Drugs that appear to be potentially prosexual temporary medical menopause can add further difficulties with reduced arousability and vaginal discomfort from the low estrogen state. There is no evidence that the higher androgen levels associated with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) afford protection from low sexual desire or low sexual arousability. Some but not all studies of women with PCOS report reduced sexual satisfaction compared to controls. The limited data suggest that lower satisfaction is related to obesity and cosmetic androgen-related effects of hirsutism and acne. One small case study showed desire to increase in six women with antiandrogen treatment and to decrease in 13 women (61). Metformin may improve sexual function in women with PCOS (62). Recurrent Herpes Fear of spreading an STD may reduce sexual motivation and arousability. Clear guidance regarding safer sexual practices is needed, along with a discussion of the causes of the woman’s
Document 15 (Title: Sexual attraction): Sexual preferences and hormones The ovulatory shift hypothesis is the theory that female humans tend to exhibit different sexual behaviours and desires at points in their cycle. Two meta-analyses published in 2014 reached opposing conclusions on whether the existing evidence was robust enough to support the prediction that women's mate preferences change across the cycle. A newer 2018 review does not show women changing the type of men they desire at different times in their fertility cycle. In males, a masculine face has been positively correlated with fewer respiratory diseases and, as a consequence, masculine features offer a marker of health and reproductive success.
