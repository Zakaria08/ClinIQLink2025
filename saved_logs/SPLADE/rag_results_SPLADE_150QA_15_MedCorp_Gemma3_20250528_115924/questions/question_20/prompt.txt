Document 1 (Title: Review of pyridoxal phosphate and the transaminases in liver disease.): In vitro supplementation with the active form of vitamin B6, pyridoxal-phosphate (PLP), increases measurements of both serum aminotransferase enzymes, L-aspartate: 2-oxoglutarate amino transferase, EC 2.6.1.1 (AST) and L-alanine: 2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase, EC 2.6.1.2 (ALT). The plasma PLP level in normal individuals clearly relates inversely to the degree of stimulation of serum AST and ALT. PLP added in vitro increases the reference values but does not decrease the biological variability of AST measurements in healthy individuals. Since B6 deficiency is observed in alcoholics, in some significant percentage of hospitalized patients and in apparently healthy people over age 64, these individuals will show PLP stimulation of their serum amino-transferase enzymes. Patients with liver disease show lesser activation with PLP of AST activity but not ALT activity than patients with heart disease (myocardial infarction). AST isoenzyme measurements in the form of a mitochondrial AST/total AST ratio may discriminate alcoholic hepatitis from all other hepatic diseases. In renal dialysis patients including transplant patients, it may be desirable to measure the aminotransferases with added PLP in order to reflect better the cytolytic state of the liver. While unconfirmed studies suggest the combination of PLP activation and AST isoenzyme measurements may aid in the diagnosis of hepatoma, PLP activation per se does not provide clear cut improved diagnostic value of AST and ALT in liver diseases. However, in view of PLP incorporation into the IFCC reference methods for AST and ALT, and the National Reference System for the Clinical Laboratory, it is recommended that PLP be included in all AST and ALT measurements.
Document 2 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): A 40-year-old woman presents to the emergency department of her local hospital somewhat disoriented, complaining of midsternal chest pain, abdominal pain, shaking, and vomiting for 2 days. She admits to having taken a “handful” of Lorcet (hydrocodone/acetaminophen, an opioid/nonopioid analgesic combination), Soma (carisoprodol, a centrally acting muscle relaxant), and Cymbalta (duloxetine HCl, an antidepressant/ antifibromyalgia agent) 2 days earlier. On physical examina-tion, the sclera of her eyes shows yellow discoloration. Labora-tory analyses of blood drawn within an hour of her admission reveal abnormal liver function as indicated by the increased indices: alkaline phosphatase 302 (41–133),* alanine amino-transferase (ALT) 351 (7–56),* aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 1045 (0–35),* bilirubin 3.33 mg/dL (0.1–1.2),* and pro-thrombin time of 19.8 seconds (11–15).* In addition, plasma bicarbonate is reduced, and she has ~45% reduced glomerular filtration rate from the normal value
Document 3 (Title: Physiology, Maternal Blood -- Clinical Significance -- Liver Disorders of Pregnancy): Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy: Presents with pruritis and jaundice in the late second or third trimester of pregnancy. Blood work shows elevated AST and ALT liver enzymes, bile acids, and bilirubin. HELLP syndrome: This condition presents with nausea, vomiting, epigastric and abdominal pain, and hypertension in the late second or third trimester of pregnancy. Laboratory studies show elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and bilirubin, platelets counts below 100,000 and schistocytes on the peripheral smear. Acute fatty liver of pregnancy: The patient has nausea, vomiting, anorexia, jaundice, and abdominal pain, usually in the third trimester of pregnancy. Some also have hypertension and proteinuria at presentation. Blood work demonstrates elevated AST, ALT, bilirubin, prothrombin time and international normalized ratio (PT/INR), and creatinine with decreased glucose and platelets.
Document 4 (Title: Alcoholic liver disease): In people with alcoholic hepatitis, the serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ratio is greater than 2:1. AST and ALT levels are almost always less than 500. The elevated AST to ALT ratio is due to deficiency of pyridoxal phosphate, which is required in the ALT enzyme synthetic pathway. Furthermore, alcohol metabolite–induced injury of hepatic mitochondria results in AST isoenzyme release. Other laboratory findings include red blood cell macrocytosis (mean corpuscular volume > 100) and elevations of serum gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin levels. Folate level is reduced in alcoholic patients due to decreased intestinal absorption, increased bone marrow requirement for folate in the presence of alcohol, and increased urinary loss. The magnitude of leukocytosis (white blood cell depletion) reflects severity of liver injury. Histologic features include Mallory bodies, giant mitochondria, hepatocyte necrosis, and
Document 5 (Title: Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) -- Evaluation): The diagnosis of NAFLD/NASH is often made incidentally when routine lab tests show abnormal liver biochemical tests or imagining tests show hepatic steatosis or hepatomegaly. Imaging modalities include ultrasonography, computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Ultrasonography, however, is most widely used as it is the least expensive and most available modality. A diagnosis of NAFLD should be made only in the absence of excessive alcohol intake (defined as alcohol consumption of more than 20 g/day for men and more than 10 g/day for women), and other causes of liver disease such as viral hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis, hereditary or drug-induced liver disease. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) are usually mildly elevated at two to five times the upper level of normal with ALT greater than AST in a 2:1 ratio. This pattern of serum aminotransferase elevation helps distinguish NAFLD from alcoholic hepatitis, as the AST is usually greater than ALT in alcoholic hepatitis in a greater than 2:1 ratio. Please note that this pattern flips in NASH with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis and the AST is usually greater than ALT in such cases. Serum alkaline phosphatase can be mildly elevated, usually up to twice the upper limit of normal. Bilirubin, albumin, and INR are usually within the normal limits but will be elevated in patients who develop cirrhosis. Ferritin can be elevated in up to 60% of patients and usually indicates more advanced disease given it is a marker of inflammation. Autoimmune antibodies such as antinuclear antibody (ANA) can be detected in low titers.
Document 6 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): FIguRE 58-1 Evaluation of the patient with jaundice. ALT, alanine aminotransferase; AMA, antimitochondrial antibody; ANA, antinuclear antibody; AST, aspartate aminotransferase; CMV, cytomegalovirus; EBV, Epstein-Barr virus; LKM, liver-kidney microsomal antibody; MRCP, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography; SMA, smooth-muscle antibody; SPEP, serum protein electrophoresis. Simply stated, the initial step is to perform appropriate blood tests in order to determine whether the patient has an isolated elevation of serum bilirubin. If so, is the bilirubin elevation due to an increased unconjugated or conjugated fraction? If the hyperbilirubinemia is accompanied by other liver test abnormalities, is the disorder hepatocellular or cholestatic? If cholestatic, is it intraor extrahepatic? All of these questions can be answered with a thoughtful history, physical examination, and interpretation of laboratory and radiologic tests and procedures.
Document 7 (Title: Effect of short-term ethanol feeding on rat testes as assessed by 31P NMR spectroscopy, 1H NMR imaging, and biochemical methods.): 31P Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and 1H NMR imaging were used to examine the effect of short-term ethanol feeding on the rat testis. Weanling rats were pair-fed for 10 weeks either on ethanol containing liquid diet (36% ethanol of total calories) or a diet in which dextrimaltose was isocalorically substituted for the ethanol of the alcohol-containing diet. In vivo 31P NMR of the testes was used to determine the intratesticular pH and the relative concentrations of various phosphorus-containing metabolites. The integrity of the blood-testes barrier was evaluated using 1H NMR imaging following a gadolinium diethylene tetramine pentaacetic acid derivative (Gd-DTPA) administration as a vascular contrast agent. After the completion of NMR studies, the testis and the liver were freeze-clamped to allow for the assay of their adenosine-5'-triphosphate (ATP) contents. Serum was assayed for its content of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alcohol and testosterone. Ethanol feeding resulted in the following: (a) a reduction in the body weight (p less than 0.05), (b) a reduction in the testicular phosphodiesters (PDE) PDE/ATP ratio (p less than 0.05), (c) an increased change in the testis image intensity difference between pre- and post-iv Gd-DTPA images, (c) a reduction in the testicular and hepatic content of ATP, and (d) increased serum levels of AST and ALT.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Document 8 (Title: First_Aid_Step2): Hx/PE: Presents with progressive jaundice, pruritus, and fatigue. Dx: is significantly associated with ■ Laboratory findings include ↑ alkaline phosphatase and ↑ bilirubin. ulcerative colitis. MRCP/ERCP show multiple bile duct strictures with dilatations between strictures. Liver biopsy reveals periductal sclerosis (“onion skinning”). Tx: High-dose ursodeoxycholic acid; endoscopic dilation and short-term stenting of bile duct strictures; liver transplantation. Patients are at ↑ risk for cholangiocarcinoma. Liver diseases can be divided into distinct patterns based on LFT results: Hepatocellular injury: ↑ AST and ALT. Cholestasis: ↑ alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin. Isolated hyperbilirubinemia: ↑ bilirubin; normal aminotransferases and alkaline phosphatase.
Document 9 (Title: Jaundice): Some bone and heart disorders can lead to an increase in ALP and the aminotransferases, so the first step in differentiating these from liver problems is to compare the levels of GGT, which are only elevated in liver-specific conditions. The second step is distinguishing from biliary (cholestatic) or liver causes of jaundice and altered laboratory results. ALP and GGT levels typically rise with one pattern while aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) rise in a separate pattern. If the ALP (10–45 IU/l) and GGT (18–85 IU/l) levels rise proportionately as high as the AST (12–38 IU/l) and ALT (10–45 IU/l) levels, this indicates a cholestatic problem. If the AST and ALT rise is significantly higher than the ALP and GGT rise, though, this indicates a liver problem. Finally, distinguishing between liver causes of jaundice, comparing levels of AST and ALT can prove useful. AST levels typically are higher than ALT. This remains the case in most liver disorders
Document 10 (Title: Glycogen storage disease type 0): Serum lactate is in reference ranges in fasting patients with glycogen-storage disease type 0. Liver function studies provide evidence of mild hepatocellular damage in patients with mild elevations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels.Plasma amino-acid analysis shows plasma alanine levels as in reference ranges during a fast. Imaging Studies Skeletal radiography may reveal osteopenia. Other Tests Evaluation of a patient with suspected glycogen-storage disease type 0 requires monitored assessment of fasting adaptation in an inpatient setting. Patients typically have hypoglycemia and ketosis, with lactate and alanine levels in the low or normal part of the reference range approximately 5–7 hours after fasting. A glucagon tolerance test may be needed if the fast fails to elicit the expected rise in plasma glucose. Lactate and alanine levels are in the reference range.
Document 11 (Title: Laboratory assessment of hepatic injury in the woodchuck (Marmota monax).): Normal reference values for total serum protein, albumin, cholesterol, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), sorbitol dehydrogenase (SDH), gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase (AP), and total bilirubin were established in 48 clinically healthy woodchucks. To validate the use of these biochemical tests in the woodchuck for assessment of liver injury, carbon tetrachloride was administered to produce hepatocellular necrosis and the common bile duct was surgically occluded to produce cholestasis. Biochemical tests were performed prior to experimental treatment and thereafter in surviving woodchucks for a period of 6 weeks. There were marked increases in the serum activities of AST, ALT, and SDH following carbon tetrachloride administration and all 3 enzymes appeared to be useful markers of acute hepatocellular injury. The predominate biochemical abnormalities in woodchucks with bile duct obstruction were hyperbilirubinemia, hypercholesterolemia and increased serum AP and GGT activities. The increase of GGT occurred earlier following bile duct obstruction and the magnitude of increase was greater than that of AP, suggesting that GGT would be the preferred serum enzyme test in the woodchuck for assessment of cholestatic liver injury.
Document 12 (Title: Isoniazid -- Monitoring): In all adults preparing to begin INH treatment, the clinician should order baseline measurements of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, serum creatinine, and platelet count. Regular monitoring of hepatic and renal function during treatment is unnecessary unless the patient has abnormal baseline levels or is at increased risk for hepatotoxicity such as alcohol misuse and hepatitis B or C infection. Serum transaminases should be measured again 2 to 4 weeks after treatment initiation for those patients. [1] In patients with pulmonary TB, monthly sputum specimens are necessary (until 2 consecutive negative cultures) to assess response to treatment. Patients with poor compliance history should be monitored with a urine test. Isoscreen test checks for INH metabolites in the urine. [28] [29]
Document 13 (Title: Cholangiocarcinoma): Signs and symptoms The most common physical indications of cholangiocarcinoma are abnormal liver function tests, jaundice (yellowing of the eyes and skin occurring when bile ducts are blocked by tumor), abdominal pain (30–50%), generalized itching (66%), weight loss (30–50%), fever (up to 20%), and changes in the color of stool or urine. To some extent, the symptoms depend upon the location of the tumor: people with cholangiocarcinoma in the extrahepatic bile ducts (outside the liver) are more likely to have jaundice, while those with tumors of the bile ducts within the liver more often have pain without jaundice.
Document 14 (Title: Serum transaminase levels in the acute phase of chronic extrahepatic cholestasis.): Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels are normal or discretely increased in rats with chronic extrahepatic cholestasis (CEHC). During the acute phase (first 72 h after biliary obstruction), however, serum transaminase values are quite elevated due to a mechanism not yet fully elucidated. Thus, this is a good experimental model, not involving hepatocellular necrosis, for the study of serum ALT and AST levels during the acute phase of CEHC. Male Wistar rats (250-350 g) were divided into two groups: group A (N = 60) was submitted to sham operation for bile duct ligation (BDL), and group B (N = 60) was submitted to BDL. Thirty and 120 min after BDL there was a 1.5-fold increase in both serum ALT and AST levels compared to sham-operated rats (P less than 0.05). Serum ALT levels were higher than AST levels as early as 30 min after BDL and the highest serum values for both transaminases were observed at 360 min which was also the last value measured. Serum AST levels increased 120 min after BDL, with no further significant increases thereafter.
Document 15 (Title: Alanine transaminase): Alanine transaminase (ALT) is a transaminase enzyme (). It is also called alanine aminotransferase (ALT or ALAT) and was formerly called serum glutamate-pyruvate transaminase or serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) and was first characterized in the mid-1950s by Arthur Karmen and colleagues. ALT is found in plasma and in various body tissues but is most common in the liver. It catalyzes the two parts of the alanine cycle. Serum ALT level, serum AST (aspartate transaminase) level, and their ratio (AST/ALT ratio) are commonly measured clinically as biomarkers for liver health. The tests are part of blood panels. The half-life of ALT in the circulation approximates 47 hours. Aminotransferase is cleared by sinusoidal cells in the liver. Function ALT catalyzes the transfer of an amino group from L-alanine to α-ketoglutarate, the products of this reversible transamination reaction being pyruvate and L-glutamate. L-alanine + α-ketoglutarate ⇌ pyruvate + L-glutamate
