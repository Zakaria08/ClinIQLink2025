Document 1 (Title: Physiology_Levy): In capillaries, diffusion of lipid-insoluble molecules is restricted to water-filled channels or pores. Movement of solute across the capillary endothelium is complex and involves corrections for attractions between solute and solvent molecules, interactions between solute molecules, pore configuration, and charge on the molecules in relation to charge on the endothelial cells. Such solute motion is not simply a matter of random thermal movement of molecules that seemingly run down a concentration gradient. For small molecules, such as water, NaCl, urea, and glucose, the capillary pores offer little restriction to diffusion (i.e., they have a low reflection coefficient; see the section “ ”). Diffusion of these substances is so rapid that the mean concentration gradient across the capillary endothelium is extremely small. The larger the lipid-insoluble molecules are, the more restricted is their diffusion through capillaries. Diffusion eventually becomes minimal when the molecular
Document 2 (Title: Physiology, Osmosis -- Introduction): Osmosis, Greek for push, is the net movement of water across a semipermeable membrane (see Figure. Osmosis). [1] [2] Across this membrane, water tends to move from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration. It is important to emphasize that ideal osmosis requires only the movement of pure water across the membrane without any movement of solute particles across the semipermeable membrane. Osmosis can still occur with some permeability of solute particles, but the osmotic effect becomes reduced with greater solute permeability across the semipermeable membrane. It is also true that, at a specific moment, water molecules can move towards either the higher or lower concentration solutions, but the net movement of water is towards the higher solute concentration. The compartment with the highest solute and lowest water concentration has the greatest osmotic pressure. Osmotic pressure can be calculated using the Van 't Hoff equation, which states that osmotic pressure depends on the number of solute particles, temperature, and how well a solute particle can move across a membrane. Its measured osmolality can describe the osmotic pressure of a solution. The osmolality of a solution describes how many particles are dissolved in the solution. The reflection coefficient of a semipermeable membrane describes how well solutes permeate the membrane. This coefficient ranges from 0 to 1. A reflection coefficient of 1 means a solute is impermeable. A reflection coefficient of 0 means a solute can be freely permeable, and the solute cannot generate osmotic pressure across the membrane. [2] The compartment with the greatest osmotic pressure pulls water in and tends to equalize the solute concentration difference between the compartments. The physical driving force of osmosis is the increase in entropy generated by the movement of free water molecules. It is also thought that the interaction of solute particles with membrane pores generates a negative pressure, which is the osmotic pressure driving the water flow. [3] Reverse osmosis occurs when water is forced to flow in the opposite direction. In reverse osmosis, water flows into the compartment with lower osmotic pressure and higher water concentration. This flow is only possible by applying an external force to the system. Reverse osmosis is commonly used to purify drinking water and requires energy input. [4] The concept of osmosis should not be confused with diffusion. Diffusion is the net movement of particles from an area of high to low concentration. One can think of osmosis as a specific type of diffusion. Both osmosis and diffusion are passive processes and involve the movement of particles from an area of high to low concentration. [2] [5]
Document 3 (Title: The permeation of organic acids through lecithin bilayers. Resemblance to diffusion in polymers.): 1. The fluxes of aliphatic acids and their derivatives through black lipid membranes made of egg lecithin in decane were measured by means of a proton titration method. 2. Permeability coefficients were calculated and these were divided by the partition coefficient of the diffusing solute in different solvent systems: n-decane, olive oil, ether and octanol. The logarithms of the diffusion coefficients thus obtained were plotted against the logarithm of the molecular weight. The data could not be fitted to a single regression line in any solvent system. 3. When the logarithm of the diffusion coefficients were correlated to the logarithm of the molecular volume (equals molecular weight/ specific gravity) all the diffusants could be fitted to the same regression line, indicating that the molecular volume is a better index of molecular size and shape than the molecular weight. 4. Analysis of the experimental results assuming a model of diffusion through soft polymers (Lieb, W.R. and Stein, W. D. (1971) Current Topics in Membranes and Transport, vol. 2, pp. 1-39, Academic Press, New York) showed that decane and olive oil are not adequate model solvents for planar lecithin membranes but ether and octanol are good models. 5. The differential mass selectivity coefficient was found to be similar to that for soft polymers and biological membranes, i.e. greater than 3.0. 6. Water could be fitted by the same regression line, thus emphasizing the generality of passive transfer and implying that water crosses lipid membranes as single molecules.
Document 4 (Title: Hemodialysis -- Anatomy and Physiology): Dialysis involves the removal of solutes across a semipermeable membrane down the concentration gradient by two mechanisms: Diffusive clearance due to random molecular motion. Small molecules have a higher rate of diffusive transport through the membrane A convective clearance occurs when the osmotic force of the water pushes solutes along with it through the membrane (solvent drag)
Document 5 (Title: Mass diffusivity): where D is the diffusion coefficient, T1 and T2 are the corresponding absolute temperatures, μ is the dynamic viscosity of the solvent. Gases The dependence of the diffusion coefficient on temperature for gases can be expressed using Chapman–Enskog theory (predictions accurate on average to about 8%): where D is the diffusion coefficient (cm2/s), A is an empirical coefficient equal to 1 and 2 index the two kinds of molecules present in the gaseous mixture, T is the absolute temperature (K), M is the molar mass (g/mol), p is the pressure (atm), is the average collision diameter (the values are tabulated page 545) (Å), Ω is a temperature-dependent collision integral (the values are tabulated but usually of order 1) (dimensionless). Pressure dependence of the diffusion coefficient For self-diffusion in gases at two different pressures (but the same temperature), the following empirical equation has been suggested:
Document 6 (Title: Molecular diffusion): In case of an ideal mix, the particle diffusion equation holds true and the diffusion coefficient D the speed of diffusion in the particle diffusion equation is independent of particle concentration. In other cases, resulting interactions between particles within the solvent will account for the following effects: the diffusion coefficient D in the particle diffusion equation becomes dependent of concentration. For an attractive interaction between particles, the diffusion coefficient tends to decrease as concentration increases. For a repulsive interaction between particles, the diffusion coefficient tends to increase as concentration increases. In the case of an attractive interaction between particles, particles exhibit a tendency to coalesce and form clusters if their concentration lies above a certain threshold. This is equivalent to a precipitation chemical reaction (and if the considered diffusing particles are chemical molecules in solution, then it is a precipitation).
Document 7 (Title: Flux): These fluxes are vectors at each point in space, and have a definite magnitude and direction. Also, one can take the divergence of any of these fluxes to determine the accumulation rate of the quantity in a control volume around a given point in space. For incompressible flow, the divergence of the volume flux is zero. Chemical diffusion As mentioned above, chemical molar flux of a component A in an isothermal, isobaric system is defined in Fick's law of diffusion as: where the nabla symbol ∇ denotes the gradient operator, DAB is the diffusion coefficient (m2·s−1) of component A diffusing through component B, cA is the concentration (mol/m3) of component A. This flux has units of mol·m−2·s−1, and fits Maxwell's original definition of flux. For dilute gases, kinetic molecular theory relates the diffusion coefficient D to the particle density n = N/V, the molecular mass m, the collision cross section , and the absolute temperature T by
Document 8 (Title: Physiology_Levy): The diffusion coefficient takes into account the thermal energy of the molecule, its size, and the viscosity of the medium through which diffusion is taking place. For spherical molecules, D is approximated by the Stokes-Einstein equation: Equation 1.2 where k = Boltzmann’s constant T = temperature in degrees Kelvin r = radius of the molecule η= viscosity of the medium According to eqs. 1.1 and 1.2 , the rate of diffusion will be faster for small molecules than for large molecules. In addition, diffusion rates are high at elevated temperatures, in the presence of large concentration gradients, and when diffusion occurs in a low-viscosity medium. With all other variables held constant, the rate of diffusion is linearly related to the concentration gradient.
Document 9 (Title: Kinetics of transdermal penetration of an organic ion pair: physostigmine salicylate.): Physostigmine salicylate was delivered from a series of solvents consisting of isopropyl myristate, isopropyl alcohol (IPA), and their mixtures across dermatomed human skin. The apparent steady-state fluxes over the time range of the test, obtained separately for physostigmine and its corresponding salicylate, indicate a consistent trend toward higher values for the salicylate in the series tested. The ratios of salicylate fluxes to physostigmine fluxes ranged from 1.1 to 3.34, the higher ratios being obtained at a volume fraction of IPA exceeding 0.7. Ionization of the ion pair at the pH of the hydrated stratum corneum immediately after its partitioning into the membrane, followed by differential diffusion of the species across the membrane, is consistent with the kinetics of penetration. It is proposed that the apparent volume of distribution of physostigmine is larger than that of salicylate and, hence, a smaller concentration difference across the diffusion barrier exists for physostigmine. This hypothesis can explain the lower flux of physostigmine to conform to Fick's first law of diffusion and the assumption of equal molar transfer to the skin of both species. The hypothesis implies that if steady state appears to have been reached for the faster migrating salicylate over the time range tested then the apparent steady state of physostigmine is not a true one. Increasing the salicylate content in one of the donor solutions by eight times over that of physostigmine decreased the saturation concentration of physostigmine but not in its flux. Increasing the physostigmine content by 6.5 times over that of salicylate in the same donor solution did not change either the flux or the salicylate concentration but decreased the permeability coefficient of physostigmine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Document 10 (Title: Physiology, Pulmonary Ventilation and Perfusion -- Clinical Significance): Intrinsic diffusion barriers between alveoli and capillaries can result in hypoxemia. Although PAO 2 is normal, impaired diffusion results in a decreased PaO 2 and increased A-a gradient. Patients with diffusion problems have more hypoxemia than hypercapnia, and oxygen therapy improves hypoxemia in diffusion deficits. Supplemental oxygen increases PAO 2 , resulting in an increased oxygen gradient contributing to diffusion. Even with oxygen therapy, there is still an increased A-a gradient. A variety of conditions can affect diffusion, which can be clinically assessed using DLCO. In lung fibrosis, the thickening of lung tissue increases the alveolar wall thickness, decreasing DLCO. [3] DLCO is also decreased in emphysema, in this case, due to the destruction of alveoli decreasing the area for gas exchange. [3] The decreased diffusion in emphysema sometimes causes diffusion-limited oxygen exchange during exercise, as increased heart rate reduces the time blood spends in alveolar capillaries for gas exchange.
Document 11 (Title: Mass diffusivity): Diffusivity, mass diffusivity or diffusion coefficient is a proportionality constant between the molar flux due to molecular diffusion and the gradient in the concentration of the species (or the driving force for diffusion). Diffusivity is encountered in Fick's law and numerous other equations of physical chemistry. The diffusivity is generally prescribed for a given pair of species and pairwise for a multi-species system. The higher the diffusivity (of one substance with respect to another), the faster they diffuse into each other. Typically, a compound's diffusion coefficient is ~10,000× as great in air as in water. Carbon dioxide in air has a diffusion coefficient of 16 mm2/s, and in water its diffusion coefficient is 0.0016 mm2/s. Diffusivity has dimensions of length2 / time, or m2/s in SI units and cm2/s in CGS units. Temperature dependence of the diffusion coefficient

Document 13 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): B. Fick’s Law of Diffusion The passive flux of molecules down a concentration gradient is given by Fick’s law: where C1 is the higher concentration, C2 is the lower concentration, area is the cross-sectional area of the diffusion path, permeability coefficient is a measure of the mobility of the drug molecules in the medium of the diffusion path, and thickness is the length of the diffusion path. In the case of lipid diffusion, the lipid:aqueous partition coefficient is a major determinant of mobility of the drug because it determines how readily the drug enters the lipid membrane from the aqueous medium.

Document 14 (Title: Physiology_Levy): Diffusion is the process by which molecules move spontaneously from an area of high concentration to one of low concentration. Thus wherever a concentration gradient exists, diffusion of molecules from the region of high concentration to the region of low concentration dissipates the gradient (as discussed later, the establishment of concentration gradients for molecules requires the expenditure of energy). Diffusion is a random process driven by the thermal motion of the molecules. Fick’s first law of diffusion quantifies the rate at which a molecule diffuses from point A to point B: Equation 1.1 where J = the flux or rate of diffusion per unit time D = the diffusion coefficient A = area across which the diffusion is occurring ΔC = the concentration difference between point A and B ΔX = the distance along which diffusion is occurring
Document 15 (Title: Solvent interaction with polydimethylsiloxane membranes and its effects on benzocaine solubility and diffusion.): The effect of polar solvents and polar cosolvent mixtures on the transport properties of benzocaine in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) was studied. Methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, and n-butanol, as well as aqueous cosolvent mixtures of each n-alkanol, were used as vehicles for benzocaine. A constant activity gradient was maintained in all diffusion studies, with the membrane exposed to saturated donor suspensions of drug, and sink conditions maintained in the receiver. In spite of the constant activity gradient, steady-state benzocaine flux was substantially enhanced with increasing n-alkanol volume fraction and reached a maximum for the pure n-alkanol in each case. At any given composition, the degree of benzocaine flux enhancement generally increased with n-alkanol carbon number. In terms of the appropriate Fick's first law expression for this system, these observations were attributed to simultaneous changes in benzocaine concentration within the PDMS membrane, the diffusion coefficient of benzocaine in PDMS, fillerless membrane volume fraction, tortuosity, and the membrane thickness. These parameters were in turn correlated with the cosolvent composition in contact with the membrane. Both membrane solubility and diffusion coefficient were found to increase substantially, but decreases in tortuosity and increases in fillerless membrane volume fraction and membrane thickness were minor.
