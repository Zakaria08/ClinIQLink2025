Document 1 (Title: Histology_Ross): ADI POS E TI SS U E 266 Adipose tissue is widely distributed throughout the body and in varying amounts in different individuals. It is a specialized connective tissue consisting of fat-storing cells, adipocytes, and has a rich blood supply. Two types of adipose tissue are recognized. The more common and abundant is referred to as white adipose tissue. Its adipocytes are very large cells whose cytoplasm contains a single large vacuole in which the fat is stored in the form of triglycerides. When observed in a typical H&E section, white adi-pose tissue appears as a mesh-like structure (see orientation micrograph). The second type is brown adipose tissue. It consists of smaller cells. Their cytoplasm is characterized by numerous vesicles that occupy much of the cells’ volume. It also is very richly vascu-larized. Brown adipose tissue is found in human newborns where it assists in maintaining body temperature. ORIENTATION MICROGRAPH: Shown here is white adipose tissue from the
Document 2 (Title: Quantification of adipose tissue by MRI: relationship with anthropometric variables.): This study had two objectives: 1) to establish magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a tool for measuring total and regional adipose tissue (AT) distribution in humans and 2) to assess the relationship between selected anthropometric variables and MRI-measured AT. Twenty-seven healthy men varying in age [40.8 +/- 14.5 (SD) yr], body mass index (28.5 +/- 4.8), and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR, 0.96 +/- 0.07) participated in the study. Total AT volume was determined using a linear interpolation of AT areas obtained on consecutive slices (n = 41) taken from head to toe (10-mm thickness, 50-mm centers). The mean change for repeated measures of total AT volume was 2.9% (range 0.9-4.3%). Large interindividual differences were observed for total AT volume (6.9-59.3 liters), subcutaneous AT (6.3-49.8 liters), and visceral AT (0.5-8.5 liters). Visceral AT represented 18.3% of the total AT. The single best predictor of total adiposity was waist circumference (R2 = 0.92). For visceral AT volume, WHR was the strongest anthropometric correlate (r = 0.85, P less than 0.01). When controlled for age and adiposity, however, WHR explained only 12% of the variation in absolute visceral AT and less than 1% of the variation in visceral-to-subcutaneous ratio. Age was a better predictor of visceral-to-subcutaneous ratio than level of adiposity or WHR. The results of this study demonstrate that MRI offers a reliable measure of regional and total AT distribution in humans and, thus, is of value as a research tool.
Document 3 (Title: Adipose tissue): An excess of visceral fat is known as central obesity, or "belly fat", in which the abdomen protrudes excessively. New developments such as the Body Volume Index (BVI) are specifically designed to measure abdominal volume and abdominal fat. Excess visceral fat is also linked to type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance, inflammatory diseases, and other obesity-related diseases. Likewise, the accumulation of neck fat (or cervical adipose tissue) has been shown to be associated with mortality. Several studies have suggested that visceral fat can be predicted from simple anthropometric measures, and predicts mortality more accurately than body mass index or waist circumference.
Document 4 (Title: Pathophysiology of Obesity -- Issues of Concern -- Obesity and Inflammatory Markers): Obesity is also referred to as chronic-low-grade inflammation or “metabolic inflammation,” which is often the focus in the pathogenesis of several diseases such as coronary artery disease, atherosclerosis, and insulin resistance. [21] [22] Adipose tissue is classified as a complex secretory organ that plays many roles in metabolism. This can modulate energy expenditure, appetite, insulin sensitivity, bone metabolism, reproductive and endocrine functions, inflammation, and immunity and act as a triacylglycerol reservoir. Visceral adiposity correlates well with an increased risk of CVD and diabetes compared to a high body mass index (BMI). [23] [24] However, the biochemical and physiologic reasons for having a better correlation of visceral adiposity are still unclear. One possible explanation is that visceral fat has direct access to the portal circulation compared to subcutaneous white adipose tissue, leading to the substances produced by visceral fat directly affecting the liver.
Document 5 (Title: Insulin Resistance -- Pathophysiology -- Adipose Tissue): Using the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp technique, researchers determined that lipolysis is sensitive to insulin. The failure of insulin to suppress lipolysis in insulin-resistant adipose tissue, especially visceral adipose tissue, increases circulating free fatty acids (FFAs). Higher levels of circulating FFAs directly affect both liver and muscle metabolism, further exacerbating insulin resistance in these tissues and contributing to lipotoxicity-induced beta-cell dysfunction. [25] [30]
Document 6 (Title: White adipose tissue): White adipose tissue also acts as a thermal insulator, helping to maintain body temperature. The hormone leptin is primarily manufactured in the adipocytes of white adipose tissue which also produces another hormone, asprosin. Location and morphology White adipose tissue is most abundant in mammals and its distribution greatly varies among different species. Usually white adipose tissue can be found in two different locations of the body where it is stored: subcutaneous adipose tissue and intra-abdominal adipose tissue. Subcutaneous adipose tissue is directly underneath the skin, while the intra-abdominal adipose tissue surrounds the organs inside the abdomen such as intestine and kidneys. The intra-abdominal adipose tissues covers the thoracic and abdominal cavity. The visceral adipose tissue is part of the intra-abdominal adipose tissue that surrounds the intestine for the most part. White adipose tissue exists mostly as a single adipocytes in the subcutaneous tissue.
Document 7 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Hypertension The relationship between insulin resistancefrom those in visceral fat; this distinction requires CT or MRI. With and hypertension is well established. Paradoxically, under increases in visceral adipose tissue, adipose tissue–derived free fatty normal physiologic conditions, insulin is a vasodilator withacids are directed to the liver. In contrast, increases in abdominal SC secondary effects on sodium reabsorption in the kidney. However, infat release lipolysis products into the systemic circulation and avert the setting of insulin resistance, the vasodilatory effect of insulin is lostmore direct effects on hepatic metabolism. Relative increases in vis- but the renal effect on sodium reabsorption is preserved. Sodium reabceral versus SC adipose tissue with increasing waist circumference sorption is increased in whites with the metabolic syndrome but not inin Asians and Asian Indians may explain the greater prevalence of
Document 8 (Title: Adipose tissue): Visceral fat can be caused by excess cortisol levels. At least 10 MET-hours per week of aerobic exercise leads to visceral fat reduction in those without metabolic-related disorders. Resistance training and caloric restriction also reduce visceral fat, although their effect may not be cumulative. Both exercise and hypocaloric diet cause loss of visceral fat, but exercise has a larger effect on visceral fat versus total fat. High-intensity exercise is one way to effectively reduce total abdominal fat. An energy restricted diet combined with exercise will reduce total body fat and the ratio of visceral adipose tissue to subcutaneous adipose tissue, suggesting a preferential mobilization for visceral fat over subcutaneous fat.
Document 9 (Title: Omental Tumors -- Introduction): The omentum is an intraabdominal organ connected to the spleen, stomach, pancreas, and colon, served by the left and right gastroepiploic arteries. The omentum is visceral adipose comprising a single layer of mesothelial cells sandwiched by connective tissue containing fibroblasts, adipocytes, mesothelium, endothelium, mast cells, lymphocytes, granulocytes, macrophages, blood vessels, connective tissue, and angiogenic and immunogenic pluripotent cells lines. The omentum plays a role in peritoneal homeostasis, including fluid and solute transport, tissue and cellular repair, angiogenesis, infection control, and lipid storage, and serves as a reservoir for stem cells.

Document 10 (Title: Body fat distribution in pre- and post-menopausal women: metabolic and anthropometric variables and their inter-relationships.): The aim of the study was to compare body fat distribution and metabolic variables in pre- and post-menopausal women. Body fat distribution was measured using abdominal circumference and computerized tomography. No significant differences were found between the two groups as regards body weight, body mass index, waist-hip ratio and total abdominal adipose tissue areas. Subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue areas were significantly higher in premenopausal women whereas visceral abdominal adipose tissue areas and the subcutaneous to visceral abdominal adipose tissue area ratios were significantly higher in post-menopausal subjects. After adjusting for body mass index, no significant differences emerged between the two groups as regards total abdominal adipose tissue areas, waist circumference, hip circumference and waist-hip circumference ratio; subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue areas were significantly lower and both visceral abdominal adipose tissue areas and visceral to subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue area ratios significantly higher in post-menopausal women (P less than 0.01). Basal glucose, sum of blood glucose values during oral glucose tolerance test and blood cholesterol values were significantly higher in the post-menopausal group (P less than 0.05), while no significant difference was observed in sum of blood insulin values during oral glucose tolerance test. Basal plasma insulin values, systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure were higher in post-menopausal women, though the differences were not significant. Only blood cholesterol was significantly higher in post-menopausal women after adjusting for visceral abdominal adipose tissue areas. Positive correlations emerged between age and waist-hip ratio (P less than 0.05), visceral abdominal adipose tissue areas and the visceral to subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue area ratio (P less than 0.001). A negative correlation was established between age and subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue areas (P less than 0.01). There was a significant correlation between visceral abdominal adipose tissue areas and metabolic and haemodynamic variables in both pre- and post-menopausal women. In pre-menopausal women, body mass index correlated with basal glucose, basal insulin, sum of glucose during oral glucose tolerance test and systolic and diastolic blood pressure (P less than 0.05). When stepwise multiple regression analysis was used to evaluate the joint effect of anthropometric variables on metabolic variables, visceral abdominal adipose tissue area proved to be the most powerful variable for predicting metabolic disorders. Our data suggest that visceral abdominal adipose tissue areas and visceral to subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue area ratios increase with age. Obesity correlates directly with the amount of subcutaneous fat, but not with the distribution pattern.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
Document 11 (Title: Adipose tissue): Visceral fat Visceral fat or abdominal fat (also known as organ fat or intra-abdominal fat) is located inside the abdominal cavity, packed between the organs (stomach, liver, intestines, kidneys, etc.). Visceral fat is different from subcutaneous fat underneath the skin, and intramuscular fat interspersed in skeletal muscles. Fat in the lower body, as in thighs and buttocks, is subcutaneous and is not consistently spaced tissue, whereas fat in the abdomen is mostly visceral and semi-fluid. Visceral fat is composed of several adipose depots, including mesenteric, epididymal white adipose tissue (EWAT), and perirenal depots. Visceral fat is often expressed in terms of its area in cm2 (VFA, visceral fat area).
Document 12 (Title: Evaluation of Patients With Obesity -- Function -- Limitations of BMI): The visceral adipose tissue that surrounds vital organs contributes significantly to the pathophysiology of cardiometabolic disease. Similarly, abnormal fat accumulation in muscle and hepatocytes cause a worsening of insulin resistance and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, respectively. Cardiometabolic disease is the underlying pathophysiological process in both metabolic and vascular diseases. The most crucial initial event is insulin resistance which progresses to metabolic syndrome or pre-diabetes, and finally to diabetes mellitus type 2 or cardiovascular disease, depending upon patient characteristics. Hence, the distribution of fat and overall adipose tissue mass has a role in disease outcomes in patients with obesity. It signifies the importance of waist circumference in the measurement of abdominal fat accumulation. [14]

The cytoplasm of the individual adipose cells is recognizable in some areas, and part of the nucleus of one of the cells is included in the plane of section. A second nucleus (arrow), which appears intimately related to one of the adipose cells, may actually belong to a fibroblast; it is difficult to tell with assurance. Because of the large size of adipose cells, the nucleus is infrequently observed in a given cell. A capillary and a small venule are also evident in the
Document 14 (Title: [Value of echography in the measurement of changes in the total and visceral adipose mass].): Various methods to assess lean and fat body masses and abdominal-visceral adipose tissue were compared in 26 obese women on extremely hypocaloric diets. The following anthropometric parameters were measured before and after 15 days of extreme calorie restriction: arm circumference (A), waist circumference (W), hip circumference (H) and thigh circumference (T); W/H, W/T, A/H and A/T ratios; subcutaneous biceps , triceps , subscapular, abdominal and thigh folds; echographic thickness of abdominal muscle-aorta; area of visceral (VAT), total (AT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue measured using computed tomography, lean and fat body masses assessed by impedance measurement. Under standard conditions it was shown that echography, like impedance measurement, was the most useful method for assessing lean and fat body masses in obese subjects, whereas plicometry was not found reliable. On extremely hypocaloric diets, echography is able to assess the variations of lean and fat body masses, whereas impedance measurement overestimated the lean body mass. Localisation indexes of visceral fat based on body circumferences were shown not to be suitable for the evaluation of changes in visceral adipose tissue, at least when these were slight. Echography was also the most useful method to assess slight changes in visceral adipose tissue.
Document 15 (Title: Evaluation of regional body fat distribution: comparison between W/H ratio and computed tomography in obese women.): Measurements of regional body fat distribution as determined by waist-to-hip ratio and visceral-to-subcutaneous adipose tissue ratio were compared in 63 obese women. Subjects were divided into three CT-evaluated tertiles on the basis of visceral-to-subcutaneous adipose tissue ratio (group I, 0.05-0.231; group II, 0.232-0.344; group III, 0.345-0.781). The three groups showed no appreciable differences in body weight, body mass index or total abdominal adipose tissue. Waist-to-hip ratio values were significantly lower in group I than in groups II and III. There was no statistically significant difference between groups II and III. Visceral abdominal adipose tissue was significantly and progressively higher in the three groups. Subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue was significantly lower in group III than in group I. All metabolic variables and systolic and diastolic blood pressure were higher when visceral-to-subcutaneous adipose tissue ratio cut-off values were increased. Waist-to-hip ratio was significantly correlated with total adipose tissue, body mass index, visceral abdominal adipose tissue and subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue. Visceral-to-subcutaneous adipose tissue ratio was correlated with visceral abdominal adipose tissue (r = 0.84, P &lt; 0.01) and subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue (r = -0.28, P &lt; 0.05). There was no correlation between visceral-to-subcutaneous adipose tissue ratio and body mass index or total abdominal adipose tissue. Visceral-to-subcutaneous adipose correlated more closely with metabolic variables than did waist-to-hip ratio. Partial correlations between waist-to-hip ratio and visceral-to-subcutaneous adipose tissue ratio and metabolic variables, adjusted for body mass index, showed statistically significant relationships for visceral-to-subcutaneous adipose tissue ratio, but not for waist-to-hip ratio. Visceral-to-subcutaneous adipose tissue ratio correlated with waist-to-hip ratio in the study population as a whole, but only in group I did the correlation between visceral-to-subcutaneous adipose tissue ratio and waist-to-hip ratio prove statistically significant. The present study demonstrates that visceral-to-subcutaneous adipose tissue ratio is a better index of body fat distribution than waist-to-hip ratio.
