Document 1 (Title: Abnormal renal glucose handling in X-linked hypophosphataemic mice.): 1. The renal handling of glucose was determined in male X-linked hypophosphataemic (Hyp/Y) mice and in control littermates (+/Y) aged 4 months. Plasma glucose concentration and urinary glucose excretion were measured before and during stepwise increase in glycaemia induced by an acute infusion of glucose. The relationship between plasma glucose concentration and urinary glucose excretion was monitored per ml of glomerular filtrate in mice fed high and low phosphate diets. 2. Hyp/Y mice fed the high phosphate diet showed a significantly higher glucosuria compared with +/Y littermates. When glycaemia was increased, Hyp/Y mice developed frank glucosuria earlier than +/Y animals. In Hyp/Y mice we could not find a threshold below which virtually no glucose was excreted in the urine, whereas this was clearly visible in +/Y mice. These differences persisted in animals fed the low phosphate diet. 3. Using the acute response to the glucoregulatory hormones, glucagon and insulin, administered exogenously, we found that the regulation of plasma glucose concentration did not differ between Hyp/Y and +/Y mice. 4. The significantly lower plasma glucose concentration observed in Hyp/Y as compared with +/Y mice decreased further during fasting. 5. We conclude that the renal reabsorptive capacity for glucose is defective in Hyp/Y mice and their low plasma glucose concentration may be explained by the renal leak. Therefore the X-linked phosphataemic mouse appears not only to be characterized by a defect in renal phosphate and calcium reabsorption but also by an altered glucose reabsorption.
Document 2 (Title: Biochemistry_Lippinco): For fructose to enter the pathways of intermediary metabolism, it must first be phosphorylated (Fig. 12.2). This can be accomplished by either hexokinase or fructokinase. Hexokinase phosphorylates glucose in most cells of the body (see p. 98), and several additional hexoses can serve as substrates for this enzyme. However, it has a low affinity (that is, a high Michaelis constant [Km]; see p. 59) for fructose. Therefore, unless the intracellular concentration of fructose becomes unusually high, the normal presence of saturating concentrations of glucose means that little fructose is phosphorylated by hexokinase. Fructokinase provides the primary mechanism for fructose phosphorylation (see Fig. 12.2). The enzyme has a low Km for fructose and a high Vmax ([maximal velocity] see p. 57). It is found in the liver (which processes most of the dietary fructose), kidneys, and the small intestine and converts fructose to fructose 1-phosphate, using ATP as the phosphate donor. [Note: These
Document 3 (Title: Genetics, Inducible Operon -- Molecular Level): Extracellular glucose can also regulate the lac operon by carbon catabolite repression (CCR), a phenomenon formerly called the "glucose effect." The phosphoenolpyruvate: carbohydrate phosphotransferase system (PTS) couples the transport and phosphorylation of glucose as it moves into the cell and plays a central role in exerting the effects of glucose on the expression of the lac operon. The transfer of a phosphate group from phosphoenolpyruvate to glucose occurs in 2 steps, each catalyzed by different proteins. The phosphoryl group is first accepted by enzyme I and HPr, which transfers it to a sugar-specific Enzyme II. Enzyme II, which is specific for transporting glucose, is EIIAGlc. As glucose levels increase in the environment, they are transported into the cells and phosphorylated by EIIAGlc. Dephosphorylated EIIAGlc binds to LacY and prevents the formation of lac permease. This blocks the entry of lactose into the cell, decreasing the intracellular concentration of the inducer, a phenomenon called inducer exclusion. This ensures that the cells use glucose and that other carbon sources, such as lactose, are not metabolized. [19] [20]
Document 4 (Title: UTP—glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase): In higher animals, the enzyme is highly active in tissues involved in glycogenesis, including the liver and the muscles. An exception is the brain, which has high levels of glycogen but low specific activity of UTP—glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase. In animal cells, UTP—glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase is found predominantly in the cytoplasm. UTP—glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase is also required for galactose metabolism in animals and microorganisms. In galactose metabolism, the enzyme galactose 1-phosphate uridylyltransferase transfers a phosphate from UDP-glucose to galactose 1-phosphate to produce UDP-galactose, which is then converted to UDP-glucose. Bacteria with defective UTP—glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase are unable to incorporate galactose into their cell walls.
Document 5 (Title: Cell_Biology_Alberts): The success of living organisms is attributable to a cell’s ability to make enzymes of many types, each with precisely specified properties. Each enzyme Figure 2–23 enzymes cannot change the equilibrium point for reactions. enzymes, like all catalysts, speed up the forward and backward rates of a reaction by the same factor. Therefore, for both the catalyzed and the uncatalyzed reactions shown here, the number of molecules undergoing the transition X → Y is equal to the number of molecules undergoing the transition Y → X when the ratio of Y molecules to X molecules is 3 to 1. in other words, the two reactions reach equilibrium at exactly the same point.
Document 6 (Title: Glucokinase): Because of this cooperativity, the kinetic interaction of glucokinase with glucose does not follow classical Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Rather than a Km for glucose, it is more accurate to describe a half-saturation level S0.5, which is the concentration at which the enzyme is 50% saturated and active. The S0.5 and nH extrapolate to an "inflection point" of the curve describing enzyme activity as a function of glucose concentration at about 4 mmol/L. In other words, at a glucose concentration of about 72 mg/dL, which is near the low end of the normal range, glucokinase activity is most sensitive to small changes in glucose concentration.
Document 7 (Title: Biochemistry_Lippinco): 1. Hexokinases I–III: In most tissues, glucose phosphorylation is catalyzed by one of these isozymes of hexokinase, which is one of three regulatory enzymes of glycolysis (along with phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase). They are inhibited by the reaction product glucose 6-phosphate, which accumulates when further metabolism of this hexose phosphate is reduced. Hexokinases I–III have a low Michaelis constant (Km) and, therefore, a high affinity (see p. 59) for glucose. This permits the efficient phosphorylation and subsequent metabolism of glucose even when tissue concentrations of glucose are low (Fig. 8.13). However, because these isozymes have a low maximal velocity ([Vmax] see p. 57) for glucose, they do not sequester (trap) cellular phosphate in the form of phosphorylated glucose or phosphorylate more glucose than the cell can use. [Note: These isozymes have broad substrate specificity and are able to phosphorylate several hexoses in addition to glucose.] 2. Hexokinase IV: In
Document 8 (Title: Biochemistry, Aerobic Glycolysis -- Clinical Significance): Glucokinase Deficiency : Both glucokinase and hexokinase perform the same function of phosphorylating glucose to glucose-6-phosphate and trapping it in the cell. The difference between the two lies in their location and affinity to glucose. Glucokinase is present in the liver and pancreatic beta cells. Hexokinase, its isomer form, is present in tissues other than liver and pancreatic beta cells. Glucokinase has a much lower affinity for glucose than hexokinase and will function only when the glucose levels are high. After a meal, when blood glucose levels rise, glucokinase directs it toward glycogen synthesis and storage in the liver. When the glucose levels are low, hexokinase with high affinity will get to the glucose first so as to provide the glucose to cells that need it the most. Additionally, glucokinase in pancreatic beta cells acts as a glucose sensor and regulates the rate of entry of glucose into cells and into glycolysis, and therefore helps maintain the proper glucose levels in the blood. Heterozygous inactivating mutations of glucokinase result in maturity-onset diabetes of the young type 2 (MODY2 or GCK-MODY) [4] [5] . Homozygous mutations result in a complete deficiency of this enzyme and cause neonatal diabetes mellitus [6] [7] [8] .
Document 9 (Title: A kinetic method for glucose that is insensitive to variations in temperature and enzyme activity.): We have adapted for glucose determination a new approach to kinetic analyses [Anal. Chem. 50, 1611 (1978)]; it is 50-fold less dependent upon some experimental variables than is a more conventional rate method. Modification of a commercially available hexokinase/glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase reagent system for glucose provides that the rate of production of NADH be first-order in total glucose concentration within about 30 s after sample and reagent are mixed. In the kinetic method, absorbance vs. time data recorded after 30 s and a multiple-linear-regression program are used to compute the absorbance change that would occur if the reaction were monitored to completion. Results demonstrate a linear relationship between glucose concentration and computed absorbance change. Application of the method to 51 human sera without rigorous control of either temperature or reagent composition yielded a regression equation of y = 1.01x -0.3 when kinetic results (y) were compared with equilibrium results (x) for the same samples analyzed in a hospital laboratory.
Document 10 (Title: Effects of magnesium on the kinetic properties of bovine heart glycogen synthase D.): Highly purified glycogen synthase D, free of synthase kinase and phosphatase activities, was prepared from bovine heart. The enzyme had no activity without glucose 6-phosphate. Kinetic studies of this enzyme at various concentrations of UDP-glucose demonstrated that there was no cooperativity with respect to the substrate at any concentration of glucose-6-P with or without Mg2+. Glucose 6-phosphate increased the maximum velocity (Vmax) of the enzyme, but had very little or no effect on the Michaelis constant for UDP-glucose (Km equals 0.33 mM). Free Mg2+ gave a high Vmax at all glucose 6-phosphate concentrations without affecting the Km for the substrate. The double reciprocal plots of reaction rates versus glucose 6-phosphate concentration were biphasic and were interpreted as evidence for two kinetic forms, each with a glucose 6-phosphate binding site of different affinity (A1/2 values equals 0.31 and 1.1 mM). High Mg2+ concentrations nearly abolished the biphasic kinetic behavior of glucose 6-phosphate, suggesting that the Vmax of both enzyme forms was the same at saturating concentration of Mg2+ and glucose 6-phosphate and that magnesium ion might have no effect on the binding of glucose 6-phosphate or on the state of the equilibrium between two forms. Plots of reaction velocity versus Mg2+ concentration showed no cooperativity of Mg2+ activation in the presence or absence of glucose 6-phosphate. Both kinetic forms of glycogen synthase D had the same affinity for Mg2+ (A1/2 is approximately equal to 4 mM). Studies on the inhibition of the enzyme by Pi, ATP, and UTP were carried out with assays specific for the form of synthase with A1/2 for glucose 6-phosphate equals 0.31 mM (high affinity form) and the form with A1/2 for glucose 6-phosphate equals 1.1 mM (LOW AFFINITY FORM) BY ASSAYING WITH AND WITHOUT 5.0 MM free Mg2+, respectively. Both forms of synthase exhibited positive cooperativity with respect to UDP-glucose when inhibited by UTP, but not with Pi or ATP. Thus, each form of the enzyme had more than one UDP-glucose site, and these sites showed cooperativity only in the presence of a uridine nucleotide inhibitor. In the absence of Mg2+ (low affinity form), the inhibitors, Pi, ATP, and UTP, all induced positive cooperativity with respect to glucose 6-phosphate binding to this enzyme. The positive cooperativity induced by ATP was obliterated by adding free Mg2+ (high affinity form), but that induced by other inhibitors was affected slightly or not at all by the cation. These results indicate that each of the enzyme forms (high or low affinity forms) has more than one glucose 6-phosphate site and that these may function in a cooperative manner. The preceding findings are interpreted in relation to the importance of Mg2+ in the regulation of glycogen synthase D activity as well as the regulation of glycogen synthase phosphatase activity in heart.
Document 11 (Title: Enzyme activator): Examples Hexokinase-I Hexokinase-I (HK-I) is an enzyme activator because it draws glucose into the glycolysis pathway. Its function is to phosphorylate glucose releasing glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) as the product. HK-I not only signals the activation of glucose into glycolysis but also maintains a low glucose concentration to facilitate glucose diffusion into the cell. It has two catalytic domains (N-terminal domain and C-terminal domain) which are connected through an α-helix. The N-terminal acts as an allosteric regulator of C-terminal; the C-terminal is the only one involved in the catalytic activity. HK-I is regulated by the concentration of G6P, where G6P acts as a feedback inhibitor. At low G6P concentration, HK-I is activated; at high G6P concentration, the HK-I is inhibited.
Document 12 (Title: Biochemistry, Glycogen -- Molecular Level -- Glycogenolysis): Glycogenolysis or glycogen breakdown primarily requires glycogen phosphorylase and debranching enzyme. Glycogen phosphorylase involves the entry of phosphate (Pi) and PLP (Pyridoxal Phosphate), a cofactor derived from Vitamin B6. [10] It ultimately removes one glucose residue from glycogen in the form of Glucose-1-Phosphate. However, glycogen phosphorylase cannot break down alpha-1,4 bonds as it approaches a junction point; thus, the glycogen debranching enzyme takes over four glucose residues before reaching the junction point. [1] Like the branching enzyme, it has two catalytic properties. In this case, they are a transferase and alpha-1,6 glucosidase, which transfer the three distal glucose molecules to a proximal longer chain and hydrolysis of the alpha-1,6 glycosidic bond, respectively. The hydrolysis of the alpha-1,6 glycosidic bond yields a glucose unit instead of Glucose-1-Phosphate (G1P). The ratio of G1P to glucose generated from glycogenolysis is 10 to 1. Following G1P extraction from glycogen, it can convert to glucose-6-phosphate ( G6P ) via phosphoglucomutase for utilization in other processes such as glycolysis or the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) alternatively called the hexose monophosphate pathway(HMP pathway). [4] Alternatively, it can convert to glucose. To do so, it must break down via glucose-6-phosphatase, which is on the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. It is important to highlight that skeletal muscle does not express glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase). [2] [3] Thus, skeletal muscle cannot break down its glycogen to be utilized by other tissues.
Document 13 (Title: Altered proximal tubule glucose metabolism in X-linked hypophosphatemic mice.): In the present study we examined renal proximal tubule glucose metabolism in the X-linked hypophosphatemic (Hyp/Y) mouse. Compared to those in its normal (+/Y) littermate, Hyp/Y mouse proximal tubules showed a higher rate of glucose production when using glutamine or alpha-ketoglutarate as a substrate. The glucose production rate was not, however, different when using malate or fructose as the substrate. PTH stimulated glucose production in +/Y, but not Hyp/Y, mouse proximal tubules. The PTH resistance in Hyp/Y mouse involves steps at and post-cAMP formation, because in Hyp/Y mouse proximal tubules PTH effects a lesser stimulation of cAMP generation, and addition of 8-bromo-cAMP failed to increase the glucose production rate. The rate of glucose utilization as a whole was not different in the two groups, but the rate of glucose metabolized through the pentose cycle (PC) pathway was markedly lower in Hyp/Y mouse proximal tubules. The lower PC activity in Hyp/Y mouse proximal tubules did not result from a defect of PC enzymes, because both glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase enzyme activities were intact, and phenazine methosulfate was able to stimulate PC activity. The higher rate of glucose production and the lower rate of PC activities persisted in the in vitro cultured Hyp/Y mouse proximal tubular cells. These results suggest that the altered glucose metabolism in the Hyp/Y mouse proximal tubule is not maintained by external influences and may be an abnormality intrinsic to these cells.
Document 14 (Title: Biochemistry, Glycolysis -- Function -- Glucose): The amount of glucose available for the process regulates glycolysis, which becomes available primarily in two ways: regulation of glucose reuptake or regulation of the breakdown of glycogen. Glucose transporters (GLUT) transport glucose from the outside of the cell to the inside. Cells containing GLUT can increase the number of GLUT in the cell's plasma membrane from the intracellular matrix, therefore increasing the uptake of glucose and the supply of glucose available for glycolysis. There are five types of GLUTs. GLUT1 is present in RBCs, the blood-brain barrier, and the blood-placental barrier. GLUT2 is in the liver, beta-cells of the pancreas, kidney, and gastrointestinal (GI) tract. GLUT3 is present in neurons. GLUT4 is in adipocytes, heart, and skeletal muscle. GLUT5 specifically transports fructose into cells. Another form of regulation is the breakdown of glycogen. Cells can store extra glucose as glycogen when glucose levels are high in the cell plasma. Conversely, when levels are low, glycogen can be converted back into glucose. Two enzymes control the breakdown of glycogen: glycogen phosphorylase and glycogen synthase. The enzymes can be regulated through feedback loops of glucose or glucose 1-phosphate, or via allosteric regulation by metabolites, or from phosphorylation/dephosphorylation control. [8]
Document 15 (Title: Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase): Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD or G6PDH) () is a cytosolic enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction D-glucose 6-phosphate + NADP+ + H2O 6-phospho-D-glucono-1,5-lactone + NADPH + H+ This enzyme participates in the pentose phosphate pathway (see image), a metabolic pathway that supplies reducing energy to cells (such as erythrocytes) by maintaining the level of the co-enzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH). The NADPH in turn maintains the level of glutathione in these cells that helps protect the red blood cells against oxidative damage from compounds like hydrogen peroxide. Of greater quantitative importance is the production of NADPH for tissues involved in biosynthesis of fatty acids or isoprenoids, such as the liver, mammary glands, adipose tissue, and the adrenal glands. G6PD reduces NADP+ to NADPH while oxidizing glucose-6-phosphate. Clinically, an X-linked genetic deficiency of G6PD makes a human prone to non-immune hemolytic anemia.

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
Question: A researcher is studying the properties of an enzyme that adds phosphate groups to glucose. She discovers that the enzyme is present in most body tissues and is located in the cytoplasm of the cells expressing the enzyme. She decides to mix this enzyme under subphysiologic conditions with varying levels of glucose in order to determine the kinetic properties of the enzyme. Specifically, she adds increasing levels of glucose at a saturating concentration of phosphate and sees that the rate at which glucose becomes phosphorylated gets faster at higher levels of glucose. She observes that this rate approaches a maximum speed and calls this speed Y. She then determines the concentration of glucose that is needed to make the enzyme function at half the speed Y and calls this concentration X. Which of the following is most likely true about the properties of this enzyme?
Options:
A. High X and high Y
B. High X and low Y
C. Low X and high Y
