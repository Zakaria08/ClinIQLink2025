Document 1 (Title: Prostate cancer): Signs and symptoms Early prostate cancer usually has no clear symptoms. When they do appear, they are often similar to those of benign prostatic hyperplasia. These include frequent urination, nocturia (increased urination at night), difficulty starting and maintaining a steady stream of urine, hematuria (blood in the urine), dysuria (painful urination) as well as fatigue due to anemia, and bone pain. One study found that about a third of diagnosed patients had one or more such symptoms. Prostate cancer is associated with urinary dysfunction as the prostate gland surrounds the prostatic urethra. Changes within the gland directly affect urinary function. Because the vas deferens deposits seminal fluid into the prostatic urethra, and secretions from the prostate are included in semen content, prostate cancer may also cause problems with sexual function and performance, such as difficulty achieving erection or painful ejaculation.
Document 2 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): A 45-year-old man is brought to the local hospital emer-gency department by ambulance. His wife reports that he had been in his normal state of health until 3 days ago when he developed a fever and a productive cough. Dur-ing the last 24 hours he has complained of a headache and is increasingly confused. His wife reports that his medical history is significant only for hypertension, for which he takes hydrochlorothiazide and lisinopril, and that he is allergic to amoxicillin. She says that he developed a rash many years ago when prescribed amoxicillin for bron-chitis. In the emergency department, the man is febrile (38.7°C [101.7°F]), hypotensive (90/54 mmHg), tachypneic (36/min), and tachycardic (110/min). He has no signs of meningismus but is oriented only to person. A stat chest x-ray shows a left lower lung consolidation consistent with pneumonia. A CT scan is not concerning for lesions or elevated intracranial pressure. The plan is to start empiric antibiotics and perform a
Document 3 (Title: Case Study: 24-Year-Old Male Presenting With Polyarthralgias (Archived) -- Case Presentation): A 24-year-old white male with no known medical history presented to the hospital with chief complaints of 2 weeks of progressively worsening pain and swelling of his right wrist and left ankle joints. He did not report any fevers, chills, night sweats, weight loss or rash. He was employed as a fireman. He denied alcohol use disorder, smoking cigarettes, or any recreational drugs. Family history was significant for hypertension in father and ovarian cancer in the mother. His vital signs were within normal limits on presentation. On physical examination, the patient had significant swelling of multiple joints including the right wrist, right elbow, and left ankle. The joints were erythematous and tender to touch. Due to severe pain, he had limited range in the involved joints.
Document 4 (Title: [Paraplegia after spinal anesthesia].): A case of paraplegia occurring after a spinal anaesthetic is reported. The 79-year-old man was admitted for a fractured neck of femur. Twenty years previously, he had had pharyngeal surgery and a tracheostomy. He had also undergone a prostatectomy for prostate cancer, and had been on oestrogen therapy for two years. He complained of dyspnoea at rest and his chest film showed diffuse pulmonary opacities. In order to avoid possible intubation and respiratory complications, spinal anaesthesia was performed without any problems in the L4 space. After the surgery, the patient recovered all his motor and sensory functions in the lower limbs. On the second postoperative day, he suffered from a motor paralysis of the right leg, which spread to the left leg on the fourth day. NMR imaging showed several vertebral metastases, together with anterior and lateral epidural invasion responsible for cord compression. Treatment with tetracosactide was begun, but the patient died six weeks later in his home, not having recovered any neurological function at all in his lower limbs. In fact, it was only after the procedure that the anaesthetist was informed that, at the time the prostate cancer had been diagnosed, vertebral body metastases, of which the patient had not been informed, were already present. The part played by the spinal anaesthetic in the occurrence of the paraplegia is not clear. It is reminded that such a technique should be used with extreme care in patients having a neoplasm with a very often high incidence of vertebral metastases.
Document 5 (Title: Granuloma annulare and disseminated herpes zoster.): A 71-year-old man was admitted to the Wake Forest University/Baptist Hospital Medical Center on February 1, 1989, with pharyngitis and a cutaneous eruption that began that day. The past history was significant for a diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) made in 1984, and for longstanding hypertension, severe coronary artery disease, and prostatic hypertrophy. The patient had required no therapy for his CLL until August, 1988, when he developed hemolytic anemia and was treated with oral chlorambucil, 4 mg/day, and a tapering course of prednisone. By December, 1988, the prednisone therapy had been discontinued, but the patient required hospital admission for pneumococcal pneumonia, which responded well to intravenous antibiotic therapy. One day prior to the current admission the patient complained of persistent fevers, sore throat, productive cough, and headache. He noted a new cutaneous eruption on the day of admission in February, 1989. The past history was positive for occasional herpes stomatitis. The patient did not know if he had previously been infected with varicella. Skin examination revealed multiple (greater than 20), single, and grouped vesicles in a generalized distribution involving the bilateral trunk, head, neck, arms, and legs. The heaviest involvement was on the right posterior auricular area and on the neck. A Tzanck preparation obtained from an early lesion was positive for multinucleated giant cells. Viral culture was negative at 24 hours and at 1 week. A skin biopsy of an early vesicular lesion was performed and revealed intraepidermal vesicles with acantholysis and giant cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

D. is initiated at random sites in the genome. E. produces a polymer of deoxyribonucleoside monophosphates linked by 5′→3′-phosphodiester bonds. . What is the difference between DNA proofreading and repair? Case 6: Dark Urine and Yellow Sclerae Patient Presentation: JF is a 13-year-old boy who presents with fatigue and yellow sclerae. Focused History: JF began treatment ~4 days ago with a sulfonamide antibiotic and a urinary analgesic for a urinary tract infection. He had been told that his urine would change color (become reddish) with the analgesic, but he reports that it has gotten darker (more brownish) over the last 2 days. Last night, his mother noticed that his eyes had a yellow tint. JF says he feels as though he has no energy.
Document 7 (Title: 38-Year-Old Male Presents With Lower Extremity Edema -- Case Presentation): A 38-year-old African American male, who emigrated from Somalia 10 years ago, presented with a 6-month history of lower extremity swelling, 20-pound (9 kg) weight gain over 4 weeks, and new-onset microscopic hematuria. He had no prior history of edema, proteinuria, or hematuria. There was no prior history of any systemic illness or any heart, lung, or kidney disease. He reported no over-the-counter drug use, herbal medication use, or NSAID intake. His review of systems was positive for lethargy, fatigue, and edema at his lower extremities. His family history was negative for any kidney disease. He reported a monogamous relationship with his wife and no current or past alcohol or drug use. His medical history included recently diagnosed hypertension, latent tuberculosis, and anemia. His vital signs included a blood pressure of 160/90 and a heart rate of 78.
Document 8 (Title: Saw palmetto extract): Saw palmetto extract is an extract of the fruit of the saw palmetto. It is marketed as a treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia, but there is no clinical evidence that it is effective for this purpose. Uses and research Saw palmetto extract is commonly sold as a dietary supplement intended to improve symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)—also called prostate gland enlargement—which is a common condition among men as they age. An enlarged prostate may cause increased frequency or urgency of urination, difficulty initiating urination, weak urine stream or a stream that stops and starts, dribbling at the end of urination, and inability to completely empty the bladder. Saw palmetto extract has been studied in clinical trials as a possible treatment for people with prostate cancer and for men with lower urinary tract symptoms associated with BPH. , there is insufficient scientific evidence that saw palmetto extract is effective for treating cancer or BPH and its symptoms.
Document 9 (Title: 38-Year-Old Male Presents With Lower Extremity Edema -- Case Presentation): His physical exam revealed clear lungs and a normal heart exam on auscultation. His abdomen was soft and non-tender, and his skin was warm and dry with no rash. He had 2 plus pitting edema at the ankles. Initial laboratory data was consistent with acute kidney injury (AKI) with worsening creatinine from 1.2 to 1.6 over 1 month and nephrotic range proteinuria. Serologies for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, anti-nuclear antibody (ANA), c-ANCA, serine protease 3 (PR3) IgG, myeloperoxidase antibody (MPO), and complement levels were sent. He was started on losartan for proteinuria with plans for renal biopsy; however, he was lost to follow up. The patient then presented two weeks later with worsening edema to his waist, continued weight gain, mild hemoptysis, and streaks of blood in the stool. Physical examination now showed worsening pitting edema up to his waist with new non-pruritic, erythematous excoriations on the medial aspect of his thighs bilaterally. He was admitted to the hospital with concern for worsening vasculitis. He was started on oral prednisone and underwent a renal biopsy. For his edema, he was started on diuretics to which he responded well. Due to persistent leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing was performed to complete the workup.
Document 10 (Title: Finasteride): Enlarged prostate Physicians sometimes prescribe finasteride for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), informally known as an enlarged prostate. Finasteride may improve the symptoms associated with BPH such as difficulty urinating, getting up during the night to urinate, hesitation at the start and end of urination, and decreased urinary flow. It provides less symptomatic relief than alpha-1 blockers such as tamsulosin and symptomatic relief is slower in onset (six months or more of treatment with finasteride may be required to determine the therapeutic results of treatment). Symptomatic benefits are mainly seen in those with prostate volume > 40 cm3. In long-term studies finasteride but not alpha-1 inhibitors reduce the risk of acute urinary retention (−57% at 4 years) and the need for surgery (−54% at 4 years). If the drug is discontinued, any therapeutic benefits are reversed within about 6–8 months.
Document 11 (Title: [A case of primary pulmonary sporotrichosis].): We report the first case of primary pulmonary sporotrichosis in Japan. A 53-year-old man was admitted to our hospital for further examination of the abnormal shadows on chest X-ray film. Six months before admission, he was admitted to another hospital because of alcoholic liver disease and diabetes mellitus. Since the initial chest film showed cavities with infiltration in the left upper lung field, he was treated with antituberculous drugs despite negative sputum cultures for mycobacterium. In spite of the medication, his chest X-ray film revealed another cavitary lesion, so he was referred to our hospital. He had been asymptomatic during this period. Chest X-ray on admission disclosed multiple cavities in the left upper lobe and a cavity in the right lower lobe. Repeated sputum specimens, bronchial washings and brushings for cytology and cultures were all negative. In an attempt to clarify the pathogen, percutaneous lung aspiration (PLA) was performed. The PLA sample yielded a positive culture of Sporothrix shenckii. After the diagnosis, S. schenckii was also cultured from sputa. A sporothrix skin test and yeast agglutination test for S. schenckii were positive. In the absence of a history for skin lesion, the patient was diagnosed as a primary pulmonary sporotrichosis. As iodide therapy was ineffective, he was started on a regimen of intravenous amphotericin B. However his renal function progressively deteriorated, so amphotericin B was discontinued. Now he receives miconazole intravenously and is still under careful observation. As far as we know, this is the first report of primary pulmonary sporotrichosis in Japan. The possibility of sporotrichosis should be considered in any cases of undiagnosed cavitary lung diseases.
Document 12 (Title: Biochemistry_Lippinco): Focused History: BJ reports episodes of exertional chest pain in the last few months, but they were less severe and of short duration. He smokes (2–3 packs per day), drinks alcohol only rarely, eats a “typical” diet, and walks with his wife most weekends. His blood pressure has been normal. Family history reveals that his father and paternal aunt died of heart disease at age 45 and 39 years, respectively. His mother and younger (age 31 years) brother are said to be in good health. Physical Examination (Pertinent Findings): BJ is pale and clammy and is in distress due to chest pain. Blood pressure and respiratory rate are elevated. Lipid deposits are noted on the periphery of his corneas (corneal arcus; see left image) and under the skin on and around his eyelids (xanthelasmas; see right image). No deposits on his tendons (xanthomas) are detected.
Document 13 (Title: Historical study: Johann Gregor Mendel 1822-1884.): The life and personality of Johann Gregor Mendel (1822-1884), the founder of scientific genetics, are reviewed against the contemporary background of his times. At the end are weighed the benefits for Mendel (as charged by Sir Ronald Fisher) to have documented his results on hand of falsified data. Mendel was born into a humble farm family in the "Kuhländchen", then a predominantly German area of Northern Moravia. On the basis of great gifts Mendel was able to begin higher studies; however, he found himself in serious financial difficulties because of his father's accident and incapacitation. His hardships engendered illness which threatened continuation and completion of his studies until he was afforded the chance of absolving successfully theological studies as an Augustinian monk in the famous chapter of St. Thomas in Altbrünn (Staré Brno). Psychosomatic indisposition made Mendel unfit for practical pastoral duties. Thus, he was directed to teach but without appropriate state certification; an attempt to pass such an examination failed. At that point he was sent to the University of Vienna for a 2-year course of studies, with emphasis on physics and botany, to prepare him for the exam. His scientific and methodologic training enabled him to plan studies of the laws of inheritance, which had begun to interest him already during his theology training, and to choose the appropriate experimental plant. In 1865, after 12 years of systematic investigations on peas, he presented his results in the famous paper "Versuche über Pflanzenhybriden." Three years after his return from Vienna he failed to attain his teaching certification a second time. Only by virtue of his exceptional qualifications did he continue to function as a Supplementary Professor of Physics and Natural History in the two lowest classes of a secondary school. In 1868 he was elected Abbot of his chapter, and freed from teaching duties, was able to pursue his many scientific interests with greater efficiency. This included meteorology, the measurement of ground water levels, further hybridization in plants (a.o. involving the hawk week Hieracium up to about 1873), vegetable and fruit tree horticulture, apiculture, and agriculture in general. This involved Mendel's active participation in many organizations interested in advancing these fields at a time when appropriate research institutes did not exist in Brünn. Some of the positions he took in his capacity of Abbot had severe repercussions and further taxed Mendel's already over-stressed system. The worst of these was a 10-year confrontation with the government about the taxation of the monastery.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
Document 14 (Title: [Bronchiectasis treated with negative extra-thoracic pressure ventilation].): A 25-year old man with 5-year history of bronchiectasis was admitted to the ICU complaining of severe shortness of breath. He had a respiratory rate of 40 to 50 breath/min. On 0.5 l/min of oxygen with nasal cannula, arterial blood pH was 7.39, Paco2 52.3 mmHg, Pao2 45.0 mmHg. Then, on 1 l/min of oxygen, Pao2 was unchanged, but Paco2 increased to 58 mmHg. As his consciousness was so clear, we applied to him the negative extra-thoracic pressure ventilator which was designed by the authors. Negative extra-thoracic pressure ventilation (NETPV) was maintained at a IMV rate of 30 breath/min, peak negative extra-thoracic pressure of -20 to -30 cmH2O, and an inspiratory/expiratory ratio of 1:2. During NETPV, his respiratory rate and oxygen consumption were decreased and Pao2 was increased compared with his spontaneous breathing. He made a recovery from dyspnea, especially, he was able to take a deep breath. When NETPV was applied to him, pulmonary artery and arterial catheterizations revealed that central venous pressure was slightly decreased, cardiac index unchanged or slightly decreased, heart rate, systemic blood pressure, and pulmonary arterial pressure unchanged compared with spontaneous breathing. The patient was able to read books and maintained communication in his voice with his family and the medical staff. After 3 days of the treatment with NETPV, a marked improvement was noted and the patient was discharged from the ICU. NETPV has the benefits as follows. First, it is very easy for both a patient and a doctor to assist his breathing because an endotracheal intubation is not necessary.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Document 15 (Title: Variable expressivity in familial restless legs syndrome.): A 62-year-old man with a 20-year history of excessive daytime somnolence and kicking during sleep was an obligate carrier of the restless legs syndrome gene because his paternal grandfather, father, and all three of his children had symptoms of restless legs syndrome. The patient himself, however, denied motor restlessness after a careful and exhaustive medical history and he was originally believed to have periodic movements in sleep without restless legs. Close clinical observation did reveal nighttime motor restlessness, although the patient continued to deny its importance. Polysomnography showed frequent periodic movements in sleep. We conclude that there can be variable expressivity of the clinical features in familial restless legs syndrome and that there are probably some relatively nonrestless patients with prominent periodic movements in sleep who are carriers of the restless legs syndrome gene. Some sleep-disordered patients who are believed to have only periodic movements in sleep may have a forme fruste of autosomal dominant restless legs syndrome. If one does not examine these patients carefully at night and take an adequate family history, one may miss the diagnosis of restless legs syndrome.
