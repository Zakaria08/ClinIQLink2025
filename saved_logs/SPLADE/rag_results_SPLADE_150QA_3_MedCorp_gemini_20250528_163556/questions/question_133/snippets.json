        "title": "Why are converting enzyme inhibitors vasodilators?",
        "content": "1. The primary action of the converting enzyme inhibitors to prevent the formation of angiotensin II can explain a decrease in peripheral vascular resistance in patients with elevated, but not in those with normal or reduced plasma renin levels. 2. The inhibition of the breakdown of bradykinin will potentiate the vasodilator properties of the endogenously produced peptide. These include direct relaxation of certain vascular smooth muscle, production of vasodilator prostanoids and release of endothelium-derived relaxing factor(s). The greater release of the latter in the kidney could exert a negative feedback on the release of renin. 3. In addition, converting enzyme inhibitors may directly (by a prejunctional effect) and indirectly (by curtailing the production of angiotensin II) reduce the release of noradrenaline in the blood vessel wall. 4. Converting enzyme inhibitors may also directly reduce the responsiveness of vascular smooth muscle to vasoconstrictor stimuli (e.g. alpha-adrenoceptor activation). 5. The different effects of these therapeutic agents may concur to induce peripheral vasodilatation.",

        "title": "Enalaprilat -- Mechanism of Action",
        "content": "Enalaprilat is the active metabolite of the oral prodrug enalapril maleate. Enalaprilat is poorly absorbed orally and must be administered intravenously. It inhibits angiotensin I to angiotensin II conversion via competitive inhibition of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). [3] This inhibition disrupts the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Angiotensin II binds to AT1 receptors on smooth muscles to produce vasoconstriction and increased blood pressure. Additionally, angiotensin II\u00a0 stimulates the adrenal cortex to secrete aldosterone. Aldosterone causes the distal tubules and collecting ducts of the kidneys to reabsorb water and sodium in exchange\u00a0for potassium, which results in an expansion in extracellular volume and an increase in blood pressure. ACE inhibition leads to decreased plasma angiotensin II, leading to vasodilation and decreased aldosterone secretion. Angiotensin II also causes vasoconstriction of the afferent and efferent arterioles of the kidney, exerting a more significant effect on the efferent arterioles. Enalaprilat administration in the presence of hypovolemia can cause renal injury due to inadequate renal perfusion. [4] ACE breaks down bradykinin, a peptide that causes vasodilation. ACE inhibitors impede the breakdown of bradykinin, resulting in vasodilation and a bradykinin cough. [5]",
