Document 1 (Title: Interquartile mean): 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 has a mean value xmean = 3, and since it is a symmetric distribution, xIQM = 3 would be desired. We can solve this by using a weighted average of the quartiles and the interquartile dataset: Consider the following dataset of 9 observations: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17 There are 9/4 = 2.25 observations in each quartile, and 4.5 observations in the interquartile range. Truncate the fractional quartile size, and remove this number from the 1st and 4th quartiles (2.25 observations in each quartile, thus the lowest 2 and the highest 2 are removed). 1, 3, (5), 7, 9, 11, (13), 15, 17 Thus, there are 3 full observations in the interquartile range, and 2 fractional observations. Since we have a total of 4.5 observations in the interquartile range, the two fractional observations each count for 0.75 (and thus 3×1 + 2×0.75 = 4.5 observations). The IQM is now calculated as follows: xIQM = {(7 + 9 + 11) + 0.75 × (5 + 13)} / 4.5 = 9
Document 2 (Title: Lupus Nephritis -- Introduction): Monitoring for the development of lupus nephritis involves serial assessments of creatinine levels, urine protein-to-creatinine ratio, and urinalysis. These tests help detect increases in serum creatinine and the presence of proteinuria, which is commonly observed in lupus nephritis. Given the high risk of increased morbidity, timely treatment is crucial to prevent progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). [1] [2] [3] [4] The primary objective of treatment is to normalize kidney function or, at the very least, prevent further decline. Treatment options vary significantly based on the underlying pathological lesions. [5] [6]
Document 3 (Title: [Clinical and pathological analysis of deep mycoses].): Clinical and pathological analysis were performed on 127 cases of deep mycoses diagnosed by autopsy during the 24 years between 1964 and 1987 in Juntendo University Hospital. The following findings were obtained. 1) There has been a tendency for the number of mycoses to increase each year, especially notable for candidiasis and aspergillosis. 2) Underlying diseases were, in order of incidence, various hematologic diseases, solid tumors, inflammatory diseases and collagen diseases; the most common were various types of leukemia. 3) Candidiasis was often observed in patients with gastrointestinal tract cancers. Aspergillosis was often observed in patients with collagen diseases. 4) Regarding the visceral distribution of mycoses, aspergillosis was observed in the lung, candidiasis was observed in the lung, kidney and intestinal tract in decreasing order, and cryptococcosis was also observed in the lung and central nervous system. 5) There was a probability of fungal infections occurring in cases of lymphopenia. 6) A fever was present at the time of hospitalization in many cases of aspergillosis, and the presence of an indwelling catheter was a common feature in cases of candidiasis. 7) Fungemia was frequently observed in candidiasis, but very rarely in cases of aspergillosis. 8) The large amounts of corticosteroid hormones and blood transfusions were suspected as causative factors of fungal infections.
