With your own knowledge and the help of the following document:

Document 1 (Title: Biochemistry_Lippinco): B. in eukaryotes requires condensation of chromatin. C. in prokaryotes is accomplished by a single DNA polymerase. D. is initiated at random sites in the genome. E. produces a polymer of deoxyribonucleoside monophosphates linked by 5′→3′-phosphodiester bonds. . What is the difference between DNA proofreading and repair? Case 6: Dark Urine and Yellow Sclerae Patient Presentation: JF is a 13-year-old boy who presents with fatigue and yellow sclerae. Focused History: JF began treatment ~4 days ago with a sulfonamide antibiotic and a urinary analgesic for a urinary tract infection. He had been told that his urine would change color (become reddish) with the analgesic, but he reports that it has gotten darker (more brownish) over the last 2 days. Last night, his mother noticed that his eyes had a yellow tint. JF says he feels as though he has no energy.
Document 2 (Title: [Child abuse: report of three cases].): Child abuse, a clinical condition in young children who have received serious physical abuse, is a frequent cause of permanent injury or death. The first case is a 7-year-old boy suffering from abdominal distension and pain for 3 days. He was beaten by his mother as a result of inadequately learning his lessons. Sonogram and CT of the abdomen showed massive ascites and a pseudocyst of the pancreatic body about 3 x 3 cm in diameter. The second case is a 4-year-old girl who developed a semicomatose state after her father impulsively struck her with a chair. CT of the brain revealed subdural hematoma over the left fronto-temporal region and midline shift to the right. She expired 5 days later. The third case, a 2-year-old girl, suffered from headache, seizure, vomiting and general malaise. CT of the brain showed severe brain swelling over the right side and midline shift to the left. She expired 1 month later. Psychiatric factors are probably of prime importance in the pathogenesis of the disorder, but our knowledge of these factors is limited. Parents who inflict abuse on children do not necessarily have psychopathic or sociopathic personalities or come from borderline socioeconomic groups, although most published cases fall into one of these categories. It is clearly the responsibility of all physicians serving children to be aware of, to recognize, and to properly manage any child who has been the victim of abuse.
Document 3 (Title: Annular pancreas): Causes It is typically associated with abnormal embryological development, however adult cases can develop. It can result from growth of a bifid ventral pancreatic bud around the duodenum, where the parts of the bifid ventral bud fuse with the dorsal bud, forming a pancreatic ring. It can also result if the ventral pancreatic bud fails to fully rotate, so it remains on the right or if the dorsal bud rotates in the wrong direction, such that the duodenum is surrounded by pancreatic tissue. Blockage of the duodenum develops if inflammation (pancreatitis) develops in the annular pancreas.

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
Question: A mother brings her 3-week-old infant to the pediatrician's office because she is concerned about his feeding habits. He was born without complications and has not had any medical problems up until this time. However, for the past 4 days, he has been fussy, is regurgitating all of his feeds, and his vomit is yellow in color. On physical exam, the child's abdomen is minimally distended but no other abnormalities are appreciated. Which of the following embryologic errors could account for this presentation?
Options:
A. Abnormal migration of ventral pancreatic bud
B. Complete failure of proximal duodenum to recanalize
C. Abnormal hypertrophy of the pylorus
D. Failure of lateral body folds to move ventrally and fuse in the midline
