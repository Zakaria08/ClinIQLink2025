        "content": "A 42-year-old primigravida\u00a0woman\u00a0at 34 weeks gestation was brought to the obstetric emergency department at midnight with complaints of severe headache, blurry vision, and right upper quadrant pain for the last\u00a05 to\u00a06 hours. She noted lower extremity edema and facial swelling that was gradually increasing. She has gestational hypertension and, 1 week ago, was prescribed labetalol 200 mg twice a day. On initial presentation, her blood pressure was 190/110 mm Hg on\u00a02 separate occasions, 5 minutes apart. She had gained\u00a02 kilograms since her last antenatal checkup in the clinic\u00a0a week ago. The patient was diagnosed with severe preeclampsia. The senior obstetric resident ordered\u00a0a loading dose of magnesium sulfate to prevent imminent seizure. The hospital protocol used an intravenous (IV) and intramuscular (IM) regimen where the patient received a 4 g IV bolus and a 10 g IM dose administered as 5 g in each buttock. The senior resident gave verbal orders for magnesium sulfate administration to the junior resident, who verbally communicated the order to the nurse.",

        "content": "Philip J. Rosenthal, MD A 5-year-old American girl presents with a 1-week history of intermittent chills, fever, and sweats. She had returned home 2 weeks earlier after leaving the USA for the first time to spend 3 weeks with her grandparents in Nigeria. She received all standard childhood immunizations, but no additional treat-ment before travel, since her parents have returned to their native Nigeria frequently without medical consequences. Three days ago, the child was seen in an outpatient clinic and diagnosed with a viral syndrome. Examination reveals a lethargic child, with a temperature of 39.8\u00b0C (103.6\u00b0F) and splenomegaly. She has no skin rash or lymphadenopathy. Ini-tial laboratory studies are remarkable for hematocrit 29.8%, platelets 45,000/mm3, creatinine 2.5 mg/dL (220 \u03bcmol/L), and mildly elevated bilirubin and transaminases. A blood smear shows ring forms of Plasmodium falciparum at 1.5% parasit-emia. What treatment should be started?",

        "content": "We report on the clinical, epidemiologic, and laboratory characteristics of the first case of human ehrlichiosis acquired outside the United States caused by an Ehrlichia sp. other than E. sennetsu. The patient, a 24-year-old woman, presumably acquired the infection in Mali in northern Africa; the diagnosis was made when she returned to North America. The patient reported a fever and diarrhea a week before she left Mali; the diarrhea resolved, but the fever and chills continued. She also reported intermittent tingling in both hands and feet and muscle discomfort. Her temperature was 37.8 degrees C and her pulse rate was 100 per minute. She had two erythematous maculopapules (0.5 x 0.7 mm) on her thigh and ankle that resembled infected insect bites. Her hemoglobin level was 148 g/l with normal indices, and her white blood cell count was 10, 500/mm3 with many atypical lymphocytes and platelets. This report is intended to increase physicians' awareness of ehrlichiosis in foreign travelers and other patients, and suggests the need for further research to determine the prevalence and distribution of this disease.",
