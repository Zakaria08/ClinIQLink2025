Document 1 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): developments in Excimer laser technology have led to increased optimism regarding the ability to safely deliver laser energy. Excimer laser atherectomy approved by the FDA for peripheral artery intervention employs precision laser energy control (shallow tissue penetration) and safer wavelengths (ultraviolet as opposed to the infrared spectra in older laser technology), which decrease perforation and thermal injury to the treated vessels.A laser atherectomy catheter, with diameters varying from 0.9 to 2.5 mm, is tracked over the guidewire to the desired tar-get. Once activated, the Excimer laser uses ultraviolet energy to ablate the lesion and create a nonthrombogenic arterial lumen. This lumen is further dilated by an angioplasty balloon. Because the Excimer laser can potentially reduce the rate of distal embo-lization by evaporating the lesion, it may be used as an adjunct tool for ostial lesions and lesions that can be traversed by a wire but not an angioplasty balloon
Document 2 (Title: Refractive surgery): Transepithelial photorefractive keratectomy (TransPRK) is a laser-assisted eye surgery to correct refraction errors of human eye cornea. It employs excimer laser to ablate outer layer of cornea, epithelium, as well its connective tissue, stroma, to correct eye optical power. Laser Assisted Sub-Epithelium Keratomileusis (LASEK) is a procedure that also changes the shape of the cornea using an excimer laser to ablate the tissue from the corneal stroma, under the corneal epithelium, which is kept mostly intact to act as a natural bandage. The surgeon uses an alcohol solution to loosen then lift a thin layer of the epithelium with a trephine blade (usually with a thickness of 50 micrometres). During the weeks following LASEK, the epithelium heals, leaving no permanent flap in the cornea. This healing process can involve discomfort comparable to that with PRK.
Document 3 (Title: Ablation rate of human corneal epithelium and Bowman's layer with the excimer laser (193 nm).): Laser keratomileusis is a laser-specific procedure whereby a layer of corneal tissue as thin as 10 microns or more is removed from the anterior surface. In most cases, the laser ablates not only Bowman's layer but also portions of the anterior stroma. The histologic evaluation presented shows that the ablation behavior of these two layers is not uniform: at a fluence of 205 mJ/cm2 in Bowman's layer, the ablation rate was 0.38 +/- 0.05 microns per pulse, whereas in stroma it amounted to 0.55 +/- 0.1 microns per pulse. In epithelium, the ablation rate was 0.68 +/- 0.15 microns per pulse, but decreased with deeper excisions. We discuss the consequences of these different ablation rates on the procedure of laser keratomileusis.
