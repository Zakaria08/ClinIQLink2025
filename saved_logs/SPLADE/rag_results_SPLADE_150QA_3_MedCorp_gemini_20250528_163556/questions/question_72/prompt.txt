Document 1 (Title: Nicotine Addiction and Smoking: Health Effects and Interventions (Nursing) -- Risk Factors): Secondhand smoke from cigarettes and cigars also causes heart disease and lung cancer in adults and a number of health problems in infants and children, including: Asthma Respiratory infections and reactive airway Ear infections Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)
Document 2 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Secondhand tobacco smoke (Chap. 470), radon gas, wood smoke, and other biologic agents generated indoors must be considered. Several studies have shown that the respirable particulate load in any household is directly proportional to the number of cigarette smokers living in that home. Increases in prevalence of respiratory illnesses, especially asthma, and reduced levels of pulmonary function measured with simple spirometry have been found in the children of smoking parents in a number of studies. Recent meta-analyses for lung cancer and cardiopulmonary diseases, combining data from multiple secondhand tobacco smoke epidemiologic studies, suggest an ~25% increase in relative risk for each condition, even after adjustment for major potential confounders.
Document 3 (Title: [Prevalence of cigarette smoking in psychiatric patients].): In opinion of the WHO, AIDS and smoking are the two major epidemies, and smoking is the most important avoidable risk for health. According to epidemiological studies, smoking is a relevant risk factors connected to different types of cancers, as well as respiratory, cardiovascular, and mother-infant pathologies. In Chile 7% of the death toll can be blamed on smoking. The present information about cigarette consumption was obtained from the clinical record of 297 in-patients, discharged from the Psychiatric Clinic, University of Chile, between the year 1983 and the year 1985. Prevalence of smoking is 66.7%, with no difference per sex. 9.6% patients smoke more than 20 cigarettes a day. The prevailing clinical diagnoses are: Drug addiction (alcoholism excluded), 96.6%; schizophrenia, 81.7%; and alcoholism, 73.2%. Smoking is associated to a background of alcohol abuse, 78.9%, as well as other drug abuses, 89.7%: In other words, this is a statistically significant difference. In this study, it was found out that psychiatric in-patients were smoking more heavily than the general population--41%, and more heavily than somatic in-patients as well--42%.
