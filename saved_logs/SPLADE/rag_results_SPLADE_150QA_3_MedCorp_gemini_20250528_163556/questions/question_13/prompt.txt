Document 1 (Title: Lisch Nodules -- Evaluation): LNs have been reported in patients with segmental neurofibromatosis, which is due to a somatic mutation of the neurofibromin gene. [19] A case has been reported describing the presence of LN in a 47-year-old male with NF2 where the patient had bilateral sensorineural deafness and progressive ataxia. MRI revealed the appearance of bilateral acoustic neuromas. Multiple LNs were present in his right eye. [5] A single case report described the presence of unilateral LN with cafe-au-lait macules on the same side of the body. [21] LNs are also reported in patients with Watson syndrome characterized by cafe-au-lait macules, pulmonary valvular stenosis, and mental retardation. [9] A case report described a 43-year-old male with NF1 whose one of the sisters had multiple LNs, while her elder daughter had only one LN. Neither of these 2 patients had any signs of cutaneous or systemic neurofibromatosis. Therefore, LNs are the ocular marker of NF1 in otherwise normal family members of patients with NF1. [9] A case report described a 21-year-old healthy White woman diagnosed to have multiple, unilateral LNs in the absence of additional features of NF1. [22] She, however, had a solitary 5 mm hypopigmented macule on her back under Wood's light illumination. [22]
Document 2 (Title: Emergence and resolution of ambivalence in expectant mothers.): Little has been written about the perceptions of expectant mothers with previous histories of psychiatric disturbance and their affective oscillations during pregnancy. This paper discusses the case of a 22-year-old primigravida with a history of schizoaffective disorder who was referred to our mother-infant psychotherapy service. Despite the patient's initial defensive style, she was asked to discuss several dreams that she had had since learning about her pregnancy. A wealth of information about the patient's unconscious ambivalence and destructive wishes toward her unborn infant emerged. The patient was also unable to engage in any predictive imagery about the future of her infant or to anticipate intuitively what the experience of mothering would be like. This paper reveals that pregnant women with a history of psychological disturbances often have highly aberrational fantasies and ambivalent impulses toward their unborn infant, and some of these fantasies threaten to manifest in the form of abusive behavior after the birth. Techniques for predicting how new mothers with previous psychiatric histories will interact with their infants after birth are outlined. It is hoped that this treatment may avert child abuse.
Document 3 (Title: GLUT1 deficiency): The syndrome can cause infantile seizures refractory to anticonvulsive drugs, developmental delay, acquired microcephaly and neurologic manifestations including spasticity, hypotonia, and ataxia. The frequency, severity, and types of seizures may vary considerably among GLUT1 deficiency patients and do not necessarily correspond to the severity of other symptoms. Most seizures in GLUT1 deficiency patients are not easily treated with anti-seizure medications. A minority of GLUT1 deficiency patients (approximately 10%) do not experience seizures. Cognitive symptoms often become apparent as developmental milestones are delayed. Cognitive deficits range from subtle learning difficulties to severe intellectual disabilities. Often speech and language are impaired. Behavioral symptoms affect relations with other people and may include short attention span, intractability, and delays in achieving age-appropriate behaviors. Sociability with peers, however, is a strength in GLUT1 deficiency

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
Question: A 9-month-old female is brought to the emergency department after experiencing a seizure. She was born at home and was normal at birth according to her parents. Since then, they have noticed that she does not appear to be achieving developmental milestones as quickly as her siblings, and often appears lethargic. Physical exam reveals microcephaly, very light pigmentation (as compared to her family), and a "musty" body odor. The varied manifestations of this disease can most likely be attributed to which of the following genetic principles?
Options:
A. Anticipation
B. Multiple gene mutations
C. Pleiotropy
D. Variable expressivity
