Document 1 (Title: Madeline Cheek Hunter): Hunter identified seven components for teaching: knowledge of human growth and development content classroom management materials planning human relations instructional skills Hunter also developed a direct instructional model and elements of effective instruction. The instructional model has seven components: objectives standards anticipatory set teaching (input, modeling, checking for understanding) guided practice/monitoring closure independent practice The elements of effective instruction are very similar to those of the instructional model, featuring seven components of teaching and behavioral objectives: objectives set(hook) standards/expectations teaching (input, modeling/demo, direction giving, and checking for understanding) guided practice closure independent practice Hunter was the creator of Instructional Theory into Practice (ITIP). ITIP is a teaching model on inservice/staff development program widely used during the 1970s and 1980s.
Document 2 (Title: The use of a teaching model to promote reflection and the experiential integration of theory and practice in first-year student nurses: an action research study.): This study developed and evaluated an experiential teaching model which aimed to improve the integration of theory and practice for first-year RGN students. This work took a qualitative approach and used Lewin's action research methodology. Using a participant observation approach, data, in the form of diaries, interviews and spot checks, were gathered. To evaluate the teaching model, the spot checks were developed as an indicator of theory-practice integration. The analysis of these spot checks revealed that this teaching approach had value. The strengths and weaknesses of the teaching model, in relation to possible origins of the theory-practice gap, are outlined. The validity of action research is discussed, as are similar issues that are related to the methodology of this study.
