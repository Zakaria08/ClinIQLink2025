Document 1 (Title: Vocal cord augmentation with autogenous fat.): Since 1987, the authors have used a new technique for the augmentation and medialization of the paralyzed vocal cord. Eleven patients with paralyzed vocal cords and one patient with a surgical defect of the vocal cord have been treated with intracordal injections of autogenous fat harvested by suction from the abdominal wall. Treatment efficacy was evaluated by both subjective and objective (videostroboscopic) analyses. Patient follow-up has ranged from 5 to 42 months. All patients showed significant improvement in voice characteristics. Marked reduction in air flow and increased vocal intensity were observed. Correction of glottic insufficiency has been lasting, indicating that the implanted fat cells are viable. At this time, there has been no evidence of loss of vocal cord substance. The natural qualities of autogenous fat appear to make it an excellent alternative to Teflon or collagen. The fat is readily available, and easily harvested and injected. A larger patient population and longer follow-up periods will help determine if these initial findings are consistent.
Document 2 (Title: Reinke Edema -- Differential Diagnosis): The differential diagnosis for Reinke edema includes almost any diagnosis that can cause dysphonia. Neurologic, infectious, inflammatory, neoplastic, congenital, traumatic, and behavioral factors should all be considered in a patient with dysphonia. However, certain conditions may more closely mimic the presentation of Reinke edema. These conditions include acute and chronic laryngitis, benign and malignant tumors such as papilloma or squamous cell carcinoma, unilateral or bilateral vocal cord paresis or paralysis, presbyphonia, phonotraumatic lesions such as vocal fold nodules or hemorrhagic polyps, or functional dysphonia such as that seen in muscle tension dysphonia. [22] Because Reinke edema is a relatively rare and benign condition, due diligence is required, even if, demographically, Reinke edema seems the most likely diagnosis.
Document 3 (Title: Acupuncture): Efficacy Acupuncture has been researched extensively; as of 2013, there were almost 1,500 randomized controlled trials on PubMed with "acupuncture" in the title. The results of reviews of acupuncture's efficacy, however, have been inconclusive. In January 2020, David Gorski analyzed a 2020 review of systematic reviews ("Acupuncture for the Relief of Chronic Pain: A Synthesis of Systematic Reviews") concerning the use of acupuncture to treat chronic pain. Writing in Science-Based Medicine, Gorski said that its findings highlight the conclusion that acupuncture is "a theatrical placebo whose real history has been retconned beyond recognition." He also said this review "reveals the many weaknesses in the design of acupuncture clinical trials".
