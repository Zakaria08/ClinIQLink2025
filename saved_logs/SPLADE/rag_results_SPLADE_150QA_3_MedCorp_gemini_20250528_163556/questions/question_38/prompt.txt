Document 1 (Title: First_Aid_Step1): Upper motor neuron = everything up (tone, Reflexes • DTRs, toes) Tone • Fasciculations = muscle twitching Babinski +− Positive Babinski is normal in infants Poliomyelitis Caused by poliovirus (fecal-oral transmission). Replicates in oropharynx and small intestine before spreading via bloodstream to CNS. Infection causes destruction of cells in anterior horn of spinal cord (LMN death). Signs of LMN lesion: asymmetric weakness (vs symmetric weakness in spinal muscular atrophy), hypotonia, flaccid paralysis, fasciculations, hyporeflexia, muscle atrophy. Respiratory muscle involvement leads to respiratory failure. Signs of infection: malaise, headache, fever, nausea, etc. CSF shows  WBCs (lymphocytic pleocytosis) and slight  of protein (with no change in CSF glucose). Virus recovered from stool or throat.
Document 2 (Title: Neuroanatomy, Lower Motor Neuron Lesion -- Clinical Significance -- Poliomyelitis): A classic example of solely LMN paralysis, poliomyelitis, has a fecal-oral transmission and is caused by a type of picornavirus: poliovirus. Once infected, the virus replicated in the oropharynx and small intestine before spreading via the bloodstream to the CNS. While replicating in the Peyer's patches of the small intestine, 95% of patients are asymptomatic, and it can only be found in the stool or via an oral swab. [5] In the CNS, the virus destroys the anterior (ventral) horn of the spinal cord, resulting in LMN paralysis. Because LMNs originate in the anterior horn of the spinal cord, this results in LMN signs such as asymmetric weakness, flaccid paralysis, fasciculations, hyporeflexia, and muscle atrophy. The infection could also result in respiratory involvement leading to respiratory paralysis. Other systemic signs of infection include fever, headache, nausea, and malaise. The cerebrospinal fluid would demonstrate increased WBC's and a slight elevation of protein, which is consistent with the viral infection. Once a prominent cause of paralysis, poliomyelitis has almost been eradicated due to widespread vaccination. [6] [7]
Document 3 (Title: Polio): Spinal polio, the most common form of paralytic poliomyelitis, results from viral invasion of the motor neurons of the anterior horn cells, or the ventral (front) grey matter section in the spinal column, which are responsible for movement of the muscles, including those of the trunk, limbs, and the intercostal muscles. Virus invasion causes inflammation of the nerve cells, leading to damage or destruction of motor neuron ganglia. When spinal neurons die, Wallerian degeneration takes place, leading to weakness of those muscles formerly innervated by the now-dead neurons. With the destruction of nerve cells, the muscles no longer receive signals from the brain or spinal cord; without nerve stimulation, the muscles atrophy, becoming weak, floppy and poorly controlled, and finally completely paralyzed. Maximum paralysis progresses rapidly (two to four days), and usually involves fever and muscle pain. Deep tendon reflexes are also affected, and are typically absent or diminished;

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
Question: A 12-year-old boy who recently emigrated from Pakistan presents with fever, muscle pain, and weakness of the trunk, abdomen, and legs. The patient’s mother says that he has not been vaccinated. Physical examination reveals fasciculation and flaccid paralysis of the lower limbs. A CSF analysis reveals lymphocytosis with normal glucose and protein levels. A throat swab reveals an RNA virus. Which of the following would most likely be destroyed by the virus in this patient?
Options:
A. Posterior horn cells of the spinal cord
B. Myelin sheath of neurons
C. Muscle cells
D. Anterior horn of the spinal cord
