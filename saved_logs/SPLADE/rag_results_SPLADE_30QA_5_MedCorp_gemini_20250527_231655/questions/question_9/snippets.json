        "content": "In the cytosol of the cell (for example a muscle cell), the glycerol will be converted to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, which is an intermediate in the glycolysis, to get further oxidized and produce energy. However, the main steps of fatty acids catabolism occur in the mitochondria. Long chain fatty acids (more than 14 carbon) need to be converted to fatty acyl-CoA in order to pass across the mitochondria membrane. Fatty acid catabolism begins in the cytoplasm of cells as acyl-CoA synthetase uses the energy from cleavage of an ATP to catalyze the addition of coenzyme A to the fatty acid. The resulting acyl-CoA cross the mitochondria membrane and enter the process of beta oxidation. The main products of the beta oxidation pathway are acetyl-CoA (which is used in the citric acid cycle to produce energy), NADH and FADH. The process of beta oxidation requires the following enzymes: acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, enoyl-CoA hydratase, 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, and 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase.",

        "title": "Inactivation of soluble 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase of human placenta by fatty acids.",
        "content": "The sensitivity of soluble, 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17 beta-HSD) of human placenta to inactivation by fatty acids was examined. Exposure to the unsaturated fatty acids oleic, arachidonic, linoleic and linolenic acid resulted in the loss of activity. Methyl and ethyl esters of oleic acid, the saturated fatty acid, stearic acid and prostaglandins E2 and F2 alpha were without effect. Inactivation by oleic acid required the fatty acid at levels above its critical micelle concentration, 50 microM, as estimated by light-scattering. Steroid substrates and inhibitors did not protect against inactivation. NAD+, NADH, NADP+ and NADPH did protect. The concentrations of NADP+, 50 microM, and NAD, 1.5 mM, necessary for complete protection were significantly greater than their respective Michaelis constants, 0.16 microM and 15.2 microM. The data suggest that soluble 17 beta-HSD can bind to fatty acid micelles and that the binding site(s) on the enzyme are at or near pyridine nucleotide binding sites.",

        "content": "Mitochondrial beta-oxidation can be used to supply acetyl coenzyme A (CoA) to 2 separate pathways, depending on which tissue oxidation occurs. In skeletal and cardiac muscle, mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation leads to substrate production for the tricarboxylic acid cycle in the form of acetyl CoA and provides adenosine triphosphate (ATP) for the myocytes. However, in hepatocytes, fatty acid oxidation provides acetyl CoA for ketone body synthesis during prolonged fasting conditions, in which glycogen stores have been depleted. Mitochondrial beta-oxidation yields 4 ATP equivalents per round of oxidation in the form of one flavin adenine dinucleotide, FAD(2H) molecule and 1 nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (reduced, NADH) molecule, as well as one acetyl CoA molecule.",

The polyunsaturated fatty acids linoleic and linolenic acids are required components. D.
