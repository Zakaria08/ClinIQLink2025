        "title": "[Acute poisoning with ethylene glycol esters].",
        "content": "The study was performed of 13 acute oral poisonings with ethylene glycol ethers characterized as moderate or severe and resulting in poor outcome in 3 cases. Ethyl ether was responsible for 3 poisonings, methyl ether for 10 ones. It was found, that the intoxication had four stages or periods (initial, latent, clinical, recovery) and presented with CNS impairment, gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal disorders, decompensated metabolic acidosis, etc. The paper describes two clinical cases and experimental toxicity of cellosolves as well as the effect of the inhibitor of isovaleric acid amide alcohol dehydrogenase on animal lethality. The results obtained support the suggestion of ADH-participated metabolic activation of cellosolves in the body. The prospects of further studies into intoxication pathogenesis and new opportunities for relevant poisoning management are outlined.",

        "content": "The routes of amphetamine administration may be inhalation, intravenous, intramuscular, or transmucosal\u00a0(oral/nasal). Peak plasma levels can range from 5 to 10 minutes via intravenous administration and up to 2 to 3 hours if taken transmucosal. Symptoms typically last hours to days, based on dosage and strength, and dissipate once the drug is eliminated from the body. Given the acute symptoms associated with amphetamine intoxication, it is difficult for the clinician to distinguish amphetamine-associated psychosis from the acute psychosis of a primary mental disorder. Most agree that psychosis following amphetamine\u00a0use is characterized by persecutory delusions, visual hallucinations, and symptoms resembling acute psychosis most commonly observed in schizophrenia.",

        "content": "For control of ethanol or other sedative-hypnotic withdrawal states widely used for the management of acute anxiety states and for rapid control of panic attacks. They are also used, though less commonly, in the long-term management of GAD and panic disorders. Anxiety symptoms may be relieved by many benzodiazepines, but it is not always easy to demonstrate the superiority of one drug over another. Alprazolam has been used in the treatment of panic disorders and agoraphobia and appears to be more selective in these conditions than other benzodiazepines. The choice of benzodiazepines for anxiety is based on several sound pharmacologic principles: (1) a rapid onset of action; (2) a relatively high therapeutic index (see drug B in Figure 22\u20131), plus availability of flumazenil for treatment of overdose; (3) a low risk of drug interactions based on liver enzyme induction; and (4) minimal effects on cardiovascular or autonomic functions.",
