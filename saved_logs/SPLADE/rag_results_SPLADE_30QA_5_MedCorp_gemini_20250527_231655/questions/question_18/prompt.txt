Document 1 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): 982 Listeria monocytogenes Infections Elizabeth L. Hohmann, Daniel A. Portnoy Listeria monocytogenes is a food-borne pathogen that can cause serious infections, particularly in pregnant women and immunocompromised 176 individuals. A ubiquitous saprophytic environmental bacterium, L. monocytogenes is also a facultative intracellular pathogen with a broad host range. Humans are probably accidental hosts for this microorganism. L. monocytogenes is of interest not only to clinicians but also to basic scientists as a model intracellular pathogen that is used to study basic mechanisms of microbial pathogenesis and host immunity. L. monocytogenes is a facultatively anaerobic, nonsporulating, gram-positive rod that grows over a broad temperature range, including refrigeration temperatures. This organism is motile during growth at low temperatures but much less so at 37°C. The vast majority of cases of human listerial disease can be traced to serotypes 1/2a, 1/2b, and 4.
Document 2 (Title: Western blot analysis of the antibody response in patients with Listeria monocytogenes meningitis and septicemia.): The antibody response in patients with Listeria monocytogenes septicemia and/or meningitis was investigated using Western blot analysis (WBA). Protein antigen preparations were produced from two strains of Listeria monocytogenes, representing serogroup 1 and 4, by sonication and differential centrifugation. IgG antibodies from 8 (50%) of 16 patients with culture verified septicemia and/or meningitis due to Listeria monocytogenes reacted with a 93 kDa antigen from serogroup 1, in contrast to IgG antibodies from only 1 (2%) of 51 controls; these controls represented 21 patients with infections caused by other bacteria and 30 apparently healthy blood donors. Furthermore, IgM antibodies from 3 (19%) of the patients with listeric infections bound to a 106 kDa protein antigen in contrast to none of the controls. In 3 (33%) of 9 patients from whom acute and convalescence serum were available, the patients responded by producing antibodies against new protein antigens. Current methods used in routine serological investigations, i.e. complement fixation and O-agglutination tests, were positive in only 4 (24%) of the 16 patients with listeriosis. The results point to the possibility of designing new immunoassays for detection of septicemia and meningitis caused by Listeria monocytogenes.
Document 3 (Title: Listeria Monocytogenes -- Etiology): Listeria commonly causes meningitis in the young (neonates), elderly, and immunocompromised patient population. Healthy individuals infected with L. monocytogenes typically have a self-limiting gastrointestinal infection with fever and diarrhea. The Listeria family consists of 10 different species with L. monocytogenes found most consistently in humans. L. monocytogenes has 13 different serotypes based on a variety of flagellar and surface antigens.  However, there are only three serotypes (1/2a, 1/2b, 4a) that inflict disease in humans. [3] In general, the infectious dose of L. monocytogenes is large, meaning one must ingest a large number to cause clinical infection, but as growth and division can continue at refrigerator temperatures, these levels can be reached despite typical food storage precautions. Host immune response also affects the infectious dose. Utilization of proton pump inhibitors or other stomach acid suppression modalities makes it easier for L. monocytogenes to pass through the stomach and invade enterocytes.
Document 4 (Title: Listeria monocytogenes): Listeria monocytogenes is a Gram-positive bacterium, in the division Firmicutes, named after Joseph Lister. Its ability to grow at temperatures as low as 0 °C permits multiplication at typical refrigeration temperatures, greatly increasing its ability to evade control in human foodstuffs. Motile via flagella at 30 °C and below, but usually not at 37 °C, L. monocytogenes can instead move within eukaryotic cells by explosive polymerization of actin filaments (known as comet tails or actin rockets). Studies suggest up to 10% of human gastrointestinal tracts may be colonized by L. monocytogenes. Nevertheless, clinical diseases due to L. monocytogenes are more frequently recognized by veterinarians, especially as meningoencephalitis in ruminants. See: listeriosis in animals.
Document 5 (Title: Listeria Monocytogenes -- Pathophysiology): Once the infection has occurred, L. monocytogenes can cause amnionitis, sepsis, spontaneous abortion in pregnant women, granulomatosis infantiseptica, and meningitis. Healthy individuals infected with L. monocytogenes typically have self-limiting gastroenteritis with diarrhea and vomiting.
