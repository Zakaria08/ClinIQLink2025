Document 1 (Title: Nutrition: Micronutrient Intake, Imbalances, and Interventions -- Definition/Introduction -- Water-Soluble Vitamins): Vitamin B12 (cobalamin): Vitamin B12 is a water-soluble vitamin that is a cofactor in synthesizing DNA, fatty acids, and myelin, as well as erythropoiesis and the development of the nervous system. [7] [29] Bacteria synthesize cobalamin in the gastrointestinal tract of animals, and the host later absorbs it. Because vitamin B12 is concentrated in animal tissues, it is virtually found only in animal products such as meat, dairy, and eggs. [29] [30] The RDA of vitamin B12 for adults is 2.4 mcg/d. [31]
Document 2 (Title: Vitamin B12): Vitamin B12, also known as cobalamin, is a water-soluble vitamin involved in metabolism. It is one of eight B vitamins. It is required by animals, which use it as a cofactor in DNA synthesis, in both fatty acid and amino acid metabolism. It is important in the normal functioning of the nervous system via its role in the synthesis of myelin, and in the circulatory system in the maturation of red blood cells in the bone marrow. Plants do not need cobalamin and carry out the reactions with enzymes that are not dependent on it. Vitamin B12 is the most chemically complex of all vitamins, and for humans, the only vitamin that must be sourced from animal-derived foods. Only some archaea and bacteria can synthesize vitamin B12. Most people in developed countries get enough B12 from the consumption of meat or foods with animal sources. Vitamin B12 is available as a supplement, and for the treatment of deficiency as an intramuscular injection.
Document 3 (Title: Calcium absorption and intestinal calcium-binding protein: quantitative relationship.): The concentration of the vitamin D-induced calcium-binding protein (CaBP) and calcium absorption from the duodenum were investigated in chicks with an in vivo ligated-loop technique. The relation between CaBP and calcium absorption was dependent on a) source of vitamin D activity (either vitamin D3 or 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol); b) dosage of vitamin D3; c) time after administration of vitamin D3 to rachitic animals. To aid in the interpretation of these results, a phenomenological model was developed in which CaBP was viewed as being linearly related to a portion of calcium absorption. The model, when applied to the data, suggests that there is a "nonfunctional" pool of CaBP the size of which is determined by the vitamin D status of the animal. After correction for this nonfunctional pool, the proportionality between CaBP and calcium absorption is independent of the vitamin D status of the animal.
Document 4 (Title: Pediatrics_Nelson): In contrast to other water-soluble vitamins, absorption of vitamin B12 is complex, involving cleavage of the vitamin from dietary protein and binding to a glycoprotein called intrinsic factor, which is secreted by the gastric mucosa (parietal cells). The cobalamin–intrinsic factor complex is efficiently absorbed from the distal ileum. As vitamin B12 is absorbed into the portal circulation, it is transported bound to a specific protein, transcobalamin II. Its large stores in the liver also are unusual for a water-soluble vitamin. Efficient enterohepatic circulation normally protects from deficiency for months to years. Dietary sources of the vitamin are animal products only. Strict vegetarians should take a vitamin B12 supplement.
Document 5 (Title: Biochemistry_Lippinco): A. Distribution 1. Endogenous vitamin precursor: 7-Dehydrocholesterol, an intermediate in cholesterol synthesis, is converted to cholecalciferol in the dermis and epidermis of humans exposed to sunlight and transported to liver bound to vitamin D–binding protein. 2. Diet: Ergocalciferol (vitamin D2), found in plants, and cholecalciferol (vitamin D3), found in animal tissues, are sources of preformed vitamin D activity (Fig. 28.22). Vitamin D2 and vitamin D3 differ chemically only in the presence of an additional double-bond and methyl group in the plant sterol. Dietary vitamin D is packaged into chylomicrons. [Note: Preformed vitamin D is a dietary requirement only in individuals with limited exposure to sunlight.]
