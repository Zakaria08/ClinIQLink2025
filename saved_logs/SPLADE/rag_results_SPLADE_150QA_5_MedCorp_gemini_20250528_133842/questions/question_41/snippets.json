        "content": "Signs and symptoms In many people, symptoms are present for a considerable time before diagnosis. The most common clinical features of IPF include the following: Age over 50 years Dry, non-productive cough on exertion Progressive exertional dyspnea (shortness of breath with exercise) Dry, inspiratory bibasilar \"velcro-like\" crackles on auscultation (a crackling sound in the lungs during inhalation similar to Velcro being torn apart slowly, heard with a stethoscope). Clubbing of the digits, a disfigurement of the finger tips or toes (see image) Abnormal pulmonary function test results, with evidence of restriction and impaired gas exchange. Some of these features are due to chronic hypoxemia (oxygen deficiency in the blood), are not specific for IPF, and can occur in other pulmonary disorders. IPF should be considered in all patients with unexplained chronic exertional dyspnea who present with cough, inspiratory bibasilar crackles, or finger clubbing.",

        "content": "History of Present Illness: A 33-year-old\u00a0white female presents after admission to the general medical/surgical hospital ward with a chief complaint of shortness of breath on exertion. She reports that she was seen for similar symptoms previously at her primary care physician\u2019s office six months ago.\u00a0At that time, she was diagnosed with acute bronchitis and treated with bronchodilators, empiric antibiotics, and a short course oral steroid taper. This management did not improve her symptoms, and she has gradually worsened over six months. She reports a 20-pound (9 kg) intentional weight loss over the past year. She denies camping, spelunking, or hunting activities. She denies any sick contacts. A brief review of systems is negative for fever, night sweats, palpitations, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, neural sensation changes, muscular changes, and increased bruising or bleeding. She admits a cough, shortness of breath, and shortness of breath on exertion.",

        "content": "A 78-year-old woman with exertional dyspnea (Hugh-Jones Grade III) and dry cough was admitted to our hospital in April, 1983. She had marked cardiac cachexia and a loss of body weight due to long term heart failure. On physical examination a systolic ejection murmur and a diastolic rumbling murmur were heard without the opening snap sound. Chest radiography revealed pleural effusion and cardiomegaly. M-mode and two dimensional echocardiography demonstrated abnormal echoes in the left atrium, the density being 22.7 Hounsfield Unit. Radionuclide angiography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provided similar findings. No other mass lesion existed in the other chambers. Based on these findings, the mass was diagnosed as a left atrial myxoma. She has been well except for periodic congestive heart failure, for about five years since her discharge. The course of her ailment is interesting because her treatment is mainly symptomatic.",

        "content": "A 28-yr-old, female marathon and \"fitness\" runner presented with leg swelling, fatigue, and loss of endurance. She was running an hour or more daily in addition to regular biking and swimming. She was an instructor in a fitness center. For 2 months prior to her leg swelling, she had increased fatigue and decreased exercise tolerance. She had been seen previously for a slow healing hamstring strain. She had not had a menstrual period for over 2 yr and had refused evaluation. She admitted to very low dietary intake, which she had always denied. She was worried about her body fat. She denied recent blood loss, diuretic or cathartic use, and induced vomiting. She appeared malnourished, pale, and older than her stated age. Her weight was 41.4 kg. Her blood pressure was 90/60, and her pulse was 100 per minute. She had pitting edema of the lower extremities to the knees. The diagnosis of anorexia nervosa was made and will be discussed.",
