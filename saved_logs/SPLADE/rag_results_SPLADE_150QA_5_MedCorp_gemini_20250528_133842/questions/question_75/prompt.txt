Document 1 (Title: Amblyopia: etiology, detection, and treatment.): Amblyopia is a preventable cause of visual loss in children that may be permanent unless it is detected and treated early. It may be caused by strabismus, refractive errors, or cataracts. Primary strabismus may lead to loss of vision from amblyopia and the loss of binocularity. Secondary strabismus may be a sign of primary visual loss in one or both eyes. The most serious disorder that may present as secondary strabismus is retinoblastoma. It is imperative to detect retinoblastoma early because of its morbidity and mortality. Amblyopia is detected by assessing the visual acuity of each eye. Strabismus is detected by using the corneal light reflex test and the cover test. Focusing problems are detected by assessing the visual acuity and the red reflex. Cataracts and retinoblastoma may be detected by examining the red reflex of the eye. Treatment of amblyopia consists of correcting the amblyogenic factor with appropriate glasses and surgery. The preferred eye is patched with an adhesive patch to stimulate visual development in the amblyopic eye. The pediatrician plays a crucial role in the early detection of amblyopia, strabismus, and cataracts. The key to successful visual outcome is early recognition by the pediatrician, referral to the pediatric ophthalmologist, and prompt treatment.
Document 2 (Title: Neurology_Adams): Simultaneous impairment of vision in the two eyes, with central or centrocecal scotomas, is often caused by nutritional deficiency. This occurrence is observed most often in the chronically alcoholic or malnourished patient. Impairment of visual acuity evolves over several days to weeks, and examination discloses bilateral, roughly symmetrical central or centrocecal scotomas, with the peripheral fields being intact. With appropriate treatment (nutritious diet and vitamins B) instituted soon after the onset of visual loss, recovery is possible. If treatment is delayed, patients are left with varying degrees of permanent defect in central vision and pallor of the temporal portions of the optic discs. This disorder has been referred to as “tobacco-alcohol amblyopia,” the implication being that it is caused by the toxic effects of tobacco or alcohol or both. In fact, the problem is more likely one of nutritional deficiency and is more properly designated as deficiency amblyopia or
Document 3 (Title: Amblyopia -- Introduction): Amblyopia is a developmental disorder that affects vision. Characterized by neurodevelopmental alterations, amblyopia leads to physiological abnormalities in visual pathway development during early childhood, resulting in impaired vision occurring unilaterally or, less commonly, in both eyes. [1] This condition occurs when cortical visual development fails in one or both eyes early in life. Amblyopia is commonly known as a "lazy eye" among the general public. If left untreated, amblyopia can lead to permanent vision loss in the affected eye, even if the underlying ocular pathology is later resolved.
Document 4 (Title: Visual impairment): Other Amblyopia: is a category of vision loss or visual impairment that is caused by factors unrelated to refractive errors or coexisting ocular diseases. Amblyopia is the condition when a child's visual systems fail to mature normally because the child either suffers from a premature birth, measles, congenital rubella syndrome, vitamin A deficiency, or meningitis. If left untreated during childhood, amblyopia is currently incurable in adulthood because surgical treatment effectiveness changes as a child matures. Consequently, amblyopia is the world's leading cause of child monocular vision loss, which is the damage or loss of vision in one eye. In the best case scenario, which is very rare, properly treated amblyopia patients can regain 20/40 acuity. Corneal opacification Degenerative myopia
Document 5 (Title: Visual acuity): Proper development of normal visual acuity depends on a human or an animal having normal visual input when it is very young. Any visual deprivation, that is, anything interfering with such input over a prolonged period of time, such as a cataract, severe eye turn or strabismus, anisometropia (unequal refractive error between the two eyes), or covering or patching the eye during medical treatment, will usually result in a severe and permanent decrease in visual acuity and pattern recognition in the affected eye if not treated early in life, a condition known as amblyopia. The decreased acuity is reflected in various abnormalities in cell properties in the visual cortex. These changes include a marked decrease in the number of cells connected to the affected eye as well as cells connected to both eyes in cortical area V1, resulting in a loss of stereopsis, i.e. depth perception by binocular vision (colloquially: "3D vision"). The period of time over which an animal is highly sensitive
