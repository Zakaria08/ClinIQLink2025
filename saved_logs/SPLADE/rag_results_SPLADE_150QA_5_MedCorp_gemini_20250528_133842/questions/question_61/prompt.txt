Document 1 (Title: Direct therapeutic exposure): Direct therapeutic exposure (DTE) is a behavior therapy technique pioneered by Patrick A. Boudewyns, where stressors are vividly and safely confronted to help combat veterans, and patients suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), panic disorder, or phobias. Exposure therapy has supporting evidence with both simple and complex traumas. A similar therapy is Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR). First known publication in book form is Flooding and Implosive Therapy: Direct Therapeutic Exposure in Clinical Practice by Patrick A. Boudewyns, Robert H. Shipley. 1983. . It is not uncommon to combine DTE treatment with other therapies. Use Direct exposure has been used with a variety of populations including agoraphobia and chronic PTSD It involves as the name applies placing the client either real or imaginally in the feared situation.
Document 2 (Title: Using anticoagulants safely. Guidelines for therapeutic and prophylactic regimens.): Heparin and warfarin sodium (Coumadin, Panwarfin, Sofarin) are used most often to treat acute and recurrent venous thromboembolic disease, arterial disease, valvular heart disease, and atrial fibrillation. These agents along with dextran, pneumatic compression devices, and gradient stockings are also used to prevent deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in patients at high risk (eg, those with venous stasis, lower limb or spinal cord trauma, clotting abnormalities). Anticoagulation therapy is monitored by maintaining the activated partial thromboplastin time and the prothrombin time in the therapeutic range.
Document 3 (Title: Trauma-Informed Therapy -- Function): Trauma-focused psychotherapy is defined as any therapy that uses cognitive, emotional, or behavioral techniques to facilitate the processing of a traumatic experience, with the trauma focus being a central component of the therapeutic process. [7] Trauma-informed therapy encompasses a range of therapeutic modalities aimed at addressing the complex needs of individuals affected by trauma. These therapies are applied in behavioral health contexts to create a safe and supportive environment that fosters healing and resilience while integrating trauma awareness into every facet of care.
Document 4 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): bleeding Like the situation with heparin, bleeding with LMWH is more common in patients receiving concomitant therapy with anti-platelet or fibrinolytic drugs. Recent surgery, trauma, or underlying hemostatic defects also increase the risk of bleeding with LMWH. Although protamine sulfate can be used as an antidote for LMWH, protamine sulfate incompletely neutralizes the anticoagulant activity of LMWH because it only binds the longer chains of LMWH. Because longer chains are responsible for catalysis of thrombin inhibition by antithrombin, protamine sulfate completely reverses the anti-factor IIa activity of LMWH. In contrast, protamine sulfate only partially reverses the anti-factor Xa activity of LMWH because the shorter pentasaccharide-containing chains of LMWH do not bind to protamine sulfate. Consequently, patients at high risk for bleeding may be more safely treated with continuous IV unfractionated heparin than with SC LMWH.
Document 5 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): have manifestations of lower extremity VTE and absolute contraindications to anticoagulation, those that have a bleeding complication from anticoagulation therapy of acute VTE, or those who develop recurrent DVT or PE despite adequate anticoagula-tion therapy and for patients with severe pulmonary hypertension.When possible, anticoagulation therapy should be contin-ued in patients with vena cava filters. The duration of antico-agulation is determined by the underlying VTE and not by the presence of the IVC filter itself. Practically speaking, however, many patients who require an IVC filter for recurrent VTE are the same ones who would benefit most from indefinite antico-agulation. In patients who are not able to receive anticoagulants due to recent surgery or trauma, the clinician should continually reassess if anticoagulation may be started safely at a later date.Placement of permanent IVC filters has been evaluated as an adjunct to routine anticoagulation in patients with proximal
