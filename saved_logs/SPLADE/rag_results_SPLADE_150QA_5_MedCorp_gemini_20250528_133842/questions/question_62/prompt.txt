Document 1 (Title: Markers of chronic alcohol ingestion in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis: an aid to diagnosis.): We report here the use of the biochemical marker desialylated transferrin to aid in the diagnosis of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Conventional biochemical tests used for the detection of chronic alcohol consumption fail to differentiate nonalcoholic steatohepatitis patients from alcoholic subjects. In addition, even in those alcoholic subjects with alcoholic liver disease in whom biopsy has been performed, it is impossible to differentiate these two disease states on the basis of morphological examination alone. In this study we have examined two new markers of excessive alcohol intake, desialylated transferrin and mitochondrial AST in subjects with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and in patients consuming excessive amounts of alcohol. All nonalcoholic steatohepatitis patients consumed minimal or no alcohol and were diagnosed by morphological criteria based on liver biopsy specimens. Alcoholic subjects were consuming in excess of 80 gm/day ethanol, often with clinical evidence of overt alcoholism. Control subjects included both healthy controls and patient controls with liver diseases unrelated to alcohol. The ratio of desialylated transferrin/total transferrin was elevated only in patients who consumed excessive amounts of alcohol, whereas the ratio of mitochondrial AST to total AST (mitochondrial AST/total AST) was not significantly different between alcoholic subjects and patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. The sensitivity and specificity for the ratio desialylated transferrin/total transferrin was 81% and 98%, respectively, whereas the sensitivity for the mitochondrial AST/total AST ratio was 92%; the specificity was only 50%, indicating that there were a large number of false-positives. All the conventional markers were less sensitive and less specific than the ratio desialylated transferrin/total transferrin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Document 2 (Title: Hepatitis): Alcoholic versus non-alcoholic The most apparent distinguishing factor between alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a history of excessive alcohol use. Thus, in patients who have no or negligible alcohol use, the diagnosis is unlikely to be alcoholic hepatitis. However, in those who use alcohol, the diagnosis may just as likely be alcoholic or nonalcoholic hepatitis especially if there is concurrent obesity, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. In this case, alcoholic and nonalcoholic hepatitis can be distinguished by the pattern of liver enzyme abnormalities; specifically, in alcoholic steatohepatitis AST>ALT with ratio of AST:ALT>2:1 while in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ALT>AST with ratio of ALT:AST>1.5:1.
Document 3 (Title: Ethanol Toxicity -- Differential Diagnosis): The differential diagnosis for alcohol toxicity is very broad and includes anything that can cause an altered mental status. Considerations include trauma, sepsis, CNS infections, seizure, nonalcoholic toxicologic ingestion, hypo- or hyperthermia, hypo- or hyperthyroidism, hypoxia, and metabolic derangements. Many of these can coexist with alcohol toxicity, so it is important to have a low threshold to obtain laboratory workup and CNS imaging. Complicating the diagnosis of alcohol toxicity is the potential for the patient to ingest non-beverage alcohol such as cologne, cough syrup, and isopropyl alcohol. This can be accidental, such as in pediatrics, or intentional, such as in patients with alcohol use disorder who do not have access to alcohol. Ethylene glycol, methanol, and isopropyl toxicity are discussed in separate articles, and please see these articles for further details. Once alcohol use has been confirmed, further diagnoses have to be considered, such as Wernicke encephalopathy and hepatic encephalopathy. [1] [2]
Document 4 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Grading refers to an assessment of the severity or activity of liver disease, whether acute or chronic; active or inactive; and mild, moderate, or severe. Liver biopsy is the most accurate means of assessing severity, particularly in chronic liver disease. Serum aminotransferase levels serve as convenient and noninvasive markers for disease activity but do not always reliably reflect disease severity. Thus, normal serum aminotransferase levels in patients with hepatitis B surface antigen in serum may indicate the inactive carrier state or may reflect mild chronic hepatitis B or hepatitis B with fluctuating disease activity. Serum testing for hepatitis B e antigen and hepatitis B virus DNA can help sort out these different patterns, but these markers can also fluctuate and change over time. Similarly, in chronic hepatitis C, serum aminotransferase levels can be normal despite moderate disease activity. Finally, in both alcoholic and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, aminotransferase levels
Document 5 (Title: Alcoholic-Associated Hepatitis -- Differential Diagnosis): The differential diagnoses of alcoholic hepatitis include nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, acute or chronic viral hepatitis, drug-induced liver injury, fulminant Wilson disease, autoimmune liver disease, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, pyogenic hepatic abscess, ascending cholangitis, or decompensation associated with hepatocellular carcinoma.
