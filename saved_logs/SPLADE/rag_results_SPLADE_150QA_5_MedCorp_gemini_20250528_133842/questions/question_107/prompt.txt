Document 1 (Title: Dopamine beta-hydroxylase): Assays for DBH activity in human serum and Cerebrospinal fluid DBH activity in human serum could be estimated by a spectrophotometric method or with the aid of Ultra high performance liquid chromatography with Photo Diode Array detector (UHPLC-PDA). A sensitive assay for the detection of DBH activity in cerebrospinal fluid using High-performance liquid chromatography with Electrochemical detector(HPLC-ECD) was also described earlier. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) at DBH loci Genetic variants such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms(SNPs) at DBH loci were found to be associated with DBH activity and are well known expression quantitative trait loci. Allele variants at two regulatory SNPs namely rs1611115 and rs1989787 were shown to affect transcription of this gene. Mutations identified in Dopamine beta hydroxylase deficiency and non-synonymous SNPs such as rs6271 in this gene were found to cause defective secretion of the protein from the endoplasmic reticulum.
Document 2 (Title: The identification of related substances in triamcinolone acetonide by means of high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detector and mass spectrometry.): A study of an HPLC method for the analysis of related substances in triamcinolone acetonide is described. Several systems of solvents and samples of different lots and preparative origins were examined and a rapid-scanning diode array UV detector (DAD) was particularly useful. With the proposed technique it was possible to identify 9 alpha-bromo desonide as a principal impurity, which was present in all examined samples of triamcinolone acetonide. This identification was rendered possible by the investigation of the second derivative of the UV spectra and by means of study of the mass spectrum. Furthermore, it was possible, primarily on the basis of the spectrophotometric data, to formulate reliable hypotheses on the possible identification of 9 beta, 11 beta-epoxide of the desonide which was present at very low levels and to exclude the presence of 11-deoxy-9(11)-unsaturated desonide. The presence of the above-mentioned related substances was explained considering the scheme of synthesis described in the literature. The spectrophotometric characteristics of the studied compounds and the limits of applicability of the present procedure are discussed.
Document 3 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): is a common comorbid condition. On the other hand, if the continu-ous monitoring capacity afforded by these monitors can provide usable trend data, that may still provide clinical utility despite less accuracy at low hemoglobin levels. To date, there have been relatively few studies validating the trending capacity of noninvasive Hgb monitoring compared to serial blood draws, with limited agreement due to differences in analysis and study design.65 Further studies are required to evaluate the clinical utility of this potentially useful technology.CapnometryCapnometry is the measurement of carbon dioxide in the airway throughout the respiratory cycle. Capnometry is most commonly measured by infrared light absorption. CO2 absorbs infrared light at a peak wavelength of approximately 4.27 µm. Capnom-etry works by passing infrared light through a sample chamber to a detector on the opposite side. More infrared light passing through the sample chamber (i.e., less CO2) causes a larger
Document 4 (Title: Chromatography -- Introduction -- High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC)): This is a highly sensitive and efficient technique among different chromatography techniques, also known as high-pressure liquid chromatography. [1] Here, the solvent mixture can pass through columns containing stationary phases under high atmospheric pressure of 10 Pa to 400 Pa. This high pressure creates a high flow rate in a sample of 0.1 cm/sec to 5 cm/sec, allowing separation in a few minutes. High pressure ensures high resolution and better separation of closely related compounds; it also enables using MS as detectors, which require high flow rates. [4] The eluents are detected using UV absorption and fluorescence. The basic instrumentation setup is given in image 3.
Document 5 (Title: Chromatography -- Testing Procedures): 5 . Detection and interpretation: In column chromatography, as the solute migrates through the entire system and emerges from the column, the detectors continuously monitor the emerging mobile phase called the eluate and transmit signals in the form of voltage recorded on the chromatograph. Some of the detectors used in chromatography are mass spectrometry, refractive index, electrochemical, ultraviolet, flame ionization, electron capture, and fluorescence detectors. [25] Among these, ultraviolet detectors are the most commonly used in clinical laboratories.
