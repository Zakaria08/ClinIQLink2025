Document 1 (Title: Papillary thyroid cancer): Arguments for total thyroidectomy are: Reduced risk of recurrence, if central compartment nodes are removed at the original surgery. 30-85% of papillary carcinoma is multifocal disease. Hemithyroidectomy may leave disease in the other lobe. However, multifocal disease in the remnant lobe may not necessarily become clinically significant or serve as a detriment to patient survival. Ease of monitoring with thyroglobulin (sensitivity for picking up recurrence is increased in presence of total thyroidectomy, and ablation of the remnant normal thyroid by low dose radioiodine 131 after following a low iodine diet (LID). Ease of detection of metastatic disease by thyroid and neck node ultrasound. Post-operative complications at high-volume thyroid surgery centers with experienced surgeons are comparable to that of hemithyroidectomy. Arguments for hemithyroidectomy:
Document 2 (Title: First_Aid_Step1): Thyroid cancer Typically diagnosed with fine needle aspiration; treated with thyroidectomy. Complications of surgery include hypocalcemia (due to removal of parathyroid glands), transection of recurrent laryngeal nerve during ligation of inferior thyroid artery (leads to dysphagia and dysphonia [hoarseness]), and injury to the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve during ligation of superior thyroid vascular pedicle (may lead to loss of tenor usually noticeable in professional voice users). Papillary carcinoma Most common, excellent prognosis. Empty-appearing nuclei with central clearing (“Orphan Annie” eyes) A , psamMoma bodies, nuclear grooves (Papi and Moma adopted OrphanAnnie).  risk with RET/PTC rearrangements and BRAF mutations, childhood irradiation. Papillary carcinoma: most Prevalent, Palpable lymph nodes. Good prognosis.
Document 3 (Title: [Preservation of the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve in thyroid surgery. An anatomic study of 30 dissections].): The authors stress the importance of the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve in laryngeal physiology, by noting the consequences of its section during thyroid surgery. A rigorous anatomical study carried out on 15 fresh cadavers, i.e. 30 superior laryngeal nerves, reproducing the conditions of thyroid surgery, allowed precision of the time during surgery when the external branch is at risk of being damaged, especially during sectioning of the vascular pedicle of the upper pole and at the time of separation of the thyroid pole from the laryngeal axis. The study considers the anatomical variations of the territory of the superior thyroid artery and the various technical problems that are posed in preserving the external branch of the nerve. In the light of their findings, the authors advise that this nerve axis should be identified before ligature of the upper thyroid pedicle; if the advice is not followed then the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve may be damaged or sectioned in approximately 15% of cases.
Document 4 (Title: Anatomy, Head and Neck, Thyroid Muscles -- Surgical Considerations): The thyroid muscles and surrounding vasculature are essential to consider during surgery in the neck region. The infrahyoid muscles may require incision during thyroid surgery to increase exposure to the thyroid gland. There has been some evidence to show that injury to the infrahyoid muscles during thyroid surgery may impact patients’ voices. The primary finding regarding this injury is that patients’ ability to reach high pitches decreased postoperatively. Additionally, when dissecting the superior pole of the thyroid, it is important not to perform high ligation of the superior thyroid artery. The reason behind this is that the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve is in the vicinity and can be injured. Thus, the patient will present with dysphonia if the nerve has suffered an injury. [8]
Document 5 (Title: Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma: risk factors and outcome.): Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma, in contrast to well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma, has a dismal prognosis, and little progress has been made in improving survival for this disease. We reviewed our experience during a 23-year period to identify risk factors and possible methods to improve outcome. Between 1966 and 1989, 340 patients with thyroid carcinoma underwent operation. Of these, 17 (5%) were undergoing operative treatment of anaplastic or undifferentiated thyroid carcinoma. The female/male ratio was 3.5:1, and mean age at presentation was 63 years. The most common presenting symptoms included neck mass, voice change, or dysphagia. Unusual presentations included symptomatic bradycardia from compression of the vagus nerve and superior vena cava syndrome. Four patients had a history of well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma. Nine patients had been diagnosed or treated in the past for "goiter" or a neck mass, and four patients had concurrent differentiated thyroid carcinoma associated with the anaplastic tumor. Thus 13 (76%) of 17 patients had a previous thyroid disorder, benign or differentiated malignant, and eight (47%) of 17 patients had previous or concurrent differentiated thyroid carcinoma. At the time of presentation, six patients had unilateral true vocal cord paralysis. At operation, 14 patients had local extension of the tumor and four required tracheostomy. Only five of 12 patients showed response to postoperative radiation therapy. Overall median survival was 12 months, and 13 (76%) of 17 patients died. The two patients alive longer than 12 months had only small foci of anaplastic carcinoma in association with well-differentiated carcinoma. Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma is a locally and systemically aggressive disease, with long-term survival seen only in those with well-localized anaplastic tumor. The major risk factor in this series is a history of previous benign or malignant thyroid disease. Because of this, a more aggressive approach to thyroid masses may be warranted. Long-standing goiters or benign nodules should be followed carefully and considered for resection if they grow or do not respond to medical therapy, and total thyroidectomy for malignant disease may obviate the subsequent development of anaplastic carcinoma. This method of early diagnosis and resection of abnormal thyroid tissue seems to be the only method currently available to improve the nearly uniform fatality of this disease.

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
Question: A 38-year-old woman undergoes hemithyroidectomy for treatment of localized, well-differentiated papillary thyroid carcinoma. The lesion is removed with clear margins. However, during the surgery, a structure lying directly adjacent to the superior thyroid artery at the upper pole of the thyroid lobe is damaged. This patient is most likely to experience which of the following symptoms?
Options:
A. Voice pitch limitation
B. Ineffective cough
C. Weakness of shoulder shrug
D. Shortness of breath
