        "content": "The authors stress the importance of the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve in laryngeal physiology, by noting the consequences of its section during thyroid surgery. A rigorous anatomical study carried out on 15 fresh cadavers, i.e. 30 superior laryngeal nerves, reproducing the conditions of thyroid surgery, allowed precision of the time during surgery when the external branch is at risk of being damaged, especially during sectioning of the vascular pedicle of the upper pole and at the time of separation of the thyroid pole from the laryngeal axis. The study considers the anatomical variations of the territory of the superior thyroid artery and the various technical problems that are posed in preserving the external branch of the nerve. In the light of their findings, the authors advise that this nerve axis should be identified before ligature of the upper thyroid pedicle; if the advice is not followed then the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve may be damaged or sectioned in approximately 15% of cases.",

        "content": "The thyroid muscles and surrounding vasculature are essential to consider during surgery in the neck region. The infrahyoid muscles may require incision during thyroid surgery to increase exposure to the thyroid gland. There has been some evidence to show that injury to the infrahyoid muscles during thyroid surgery may impact patients\u2019 voices. The primary finding regarding this injury is that patients\u2019 ability to reach high pitches decreased postoperatively. Additionally, when dissecting the superior pole of the thyroid, it is important not to perform high ligation of the superior thyroid artery. The reason behind this is that the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve is in the vicinity and can be injured. Thus, the patient will present with dysphonia if the nerve has suffered an injury. [8]",

        "title": "Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma: risk factors and outcome.",
        "content": "Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma, in contrast to well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma, has a dismal prognosis, and little progress has been made in improving survival for this disease. We reviewed our experience during a 23-year period to identify risk factors and possible methods to improve outcome. Between 1966 and 1989, 340 patients with thyroid carcinoma underwent operation. Of these, 17 (5%) were undergoing operative treatment of anaplastic or undifferentiated thyroid carcinoma. The female/male ratio was 3.5:1, and mean age at presentation was 63 years. The most common presenting symptoms included neck mass, voice change, or dysphagia. Unusual presentations included symptomatic bradycardia from compression of the vagus nerve and superior vena cava syndrome. Four patients had a history of well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma. Nine patients had been diagnosed or treated in the past for \"goiter\" or a neck mass, and four patients had concurrent differentiated thyroid carcinoma associated with the anaplastic tumor. Thus 13 (76%) of 17 patients had a previous thyroid disorder, benign or differentiated malignant, and eight (47%) of 17 patients had previous or concurrent differentiated thyroid carcinoma. At the time of presentation, six patients had unilateral true vocal cord paralysis. At operation, 14 patients had local extension of the tumor and four required tracheostomy. Only five of 12 patients showed response to postoperative radiation therapy. Overall median survival was 12 months, and 13 (76%) of 17 patients died. The two patients alive longer than 12 months had only small foci of anaplastic carcinoma in association with well-differentiated carcinoma. Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma is a locally and systemically aggressive disease, with long-term survival seen only in those with well-localized anaplastic tumor. The major risk factor in this series is a history of previous benign or malignant thyroid disease. Because of this, a more aggressive approach to thyroid masses may be warranted. Long-standing goiters or benign nodules should be followed carefully and considered for resection if they grow or do not respond to medical therapy, and total thyroidectomy for malignant disease may obviate the subsequent development of anaplastic carcinoma. This method of early diagnosis and resection of abnormal thyroid tissue seems to be the only method currently available to improve the nearly uniform fatality of this disease.",
