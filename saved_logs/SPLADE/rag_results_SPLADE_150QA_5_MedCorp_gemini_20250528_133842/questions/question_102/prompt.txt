Document 1 (Title: [Acute diltiazem (DTZ) poisoning. Survey of french poison control centers].): The end-points of this study upon 134 cases reports by the french Poison Centers from 1979 to 1988 (10 years) were to specify the acute toxicity of diltiazem (DTZ). There were 83 self-poisonings in adults, with diltiazem alone (36 cases) or associated with other non cardiotoxic drugs (47), the doses of DTZ ranging from 300 to 5400 mg, and 51 acute accidental overdose in children, the doses of DTZ ranging from 60 to 420 mg. One case of hypotension was observed in a child, without rhythmic disorder, occurring twelve hours post-ingestion of 180 mg of DTZ. In adults, the clinical effects were observed following 360 mg of dose DTZ, occurring 1 1/2 hour post-ingestion. There were discomfort, brady-cardia in 16% of the cases, hypotension in 23% of the cases, cardiogenic shock in 4% of the cases and cardiac arrest in 2.4% of the cases. The rhythmic disorders occurred 2 to 15 hours post-ingestion. There were conduction defects like atrio-ventricular heart bloc I degree in 9% of the cases, II degree in 2.4% of the cases and III degree in 9% of the cases. Less frequently, sinusal bradycardia in 11% of the cases or sino-auricular heart block in 4% of the cases with sometimes auriculo ventricular heart block. These cardiac disorders occurred with 600 mg of DTZ. A cardiac arrest happened in a young healthy man who had absorbed 5400 mg of DTZ. The cardiogenic shocks occurred in patients with an history of coronary on heart disease. The poison removal is likely to prevent the occurrence of clinical or EKG effects when performed within 2 hours post-ingestion, whatever toxic the dose is. The inotropic drugs have been used in 18% of the cases; a percutaneous ventricular pacing was always effective in patients with II or III degree atrio-ventricular block or/and cardiogenir shock. These data confirm the data in thirteen patients of the literature. The acute diltiazem poisoning can occur after 600 mg of DTZ and can induce severe cardiac disorders which can be prevented with poison removal or treated with supportive care.
Document 2 (Title: Psichiatry_DSM-5): resulting from the use of other substances or medications, such as serotonin syndrome; parkinsonian hyperthermia syndrome following abrupt discontinuation of dopamine ag- thesia; hyperthermia associated with abuse of stimulants and hallucinogens; and atropine poisoning from anticholinergics. In rare instances, individuals with schizophrenia or a mood disorder may present with malignant catatonia, which may be indistinguishable from neuroleptic malignant syn- drome. Some investigators consider neuroleptic malignant syndrome to be a drug- induced form of malignant catatonia. 333.72 (624.02) Medication-Induced Acute Dystonia Abnormal and prolonged contraction of the muscles of the eyes (oculogyric crisis), head, neck (torticollis or retrocollis), limbs, or trunk developing within a few days of starting or raising the dosage of a medication (such as a neuroleptic) or after reducing the dosage of a medication used to treat extrapyramidal symptoms.
Document 3 (Title: Tramadol): Dependence and withdrawal Long-term use of high doses of tramadol causes physical dependence and withdrawal syndrome. These include both symptoms typical of opioid withdrawal and those associated with serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) withdrawal; symptoms include numbness, tingling, paresthesia, and tinnitus. Psychiatric symptoms may include hallucinations, paranoia, extreme anxiety, panic attacks, and confusion. In most cases, tramadol withdrawal will set in 12–20 hours after the last dose, but this can vary. Tramadol withdrawal typically lasts longer than that of other opioids. Seven days or more of acute withdrawal symptoms can occur as opposed to typically 3 or 4 days for other codeine analogues. Overdose Recognised risk factors for tramadol overdose include respiratory depression, addiction, and seizures. Naloxone only partially reverses the toxic effects of tramadol overdose and may increase the risk of seizures.
Document 4 (Title: Carbamazepine -- Toxicity): In adults, doses of carbamazepine exceeding 24 grams have correlated with fatal outcomes. Acute toxicity appears after 1 to 3 hours of intake and presents with neuromuscular disturbances. Patients have impaired consciousness leading to coma, tremor, restlessness, athetoid movements, psychomotor disturbances, dizziness, drowsiness, mydriasis, and nystagmus. Initially, patients experience hyperreflexia, but during intoxication, they progress into a state of hyporeflexia. Cardiac, vascular signs are generally mild with low toxicity, but with doses higher than 60 grams, severe cardiac dysfunction can occur. In cases of acute toxicity, respiratory depression, ECG abnormalities, tachycardia, shock, and urinary retention require monitoring and management to avoid end-organ damage. Treatment of an overdose focuses on eliminating the drug by inducing vomiting, gastric lavage, activated charcoal, and forced diuresis. Gastric lavage is indicated even after 4 hours of indigestion. [21] Seizures caused by carbamazepine poisoning should receive treatment with benzodiazepines such as diazepam.
Document 5 (Title: Dextromethorphan Toxicity -- Differential Diagnosis): Alcohol intoxication Amphetamine intoxication Anticholinergic poisoning Bipolar disorder Brain neoplasms Cocaine toxicity Diphenhydramine toxicity Delirium tremors Encephalitis Hyperthyroidism Hypoglycemia Hyponatremia Hypoxia Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) toxicity Malignant hyperthermia MDMA toxicity Neuroleptic malignant syndrome Serotonin syndrome Salicylate poisoning Toxic alcohol poisoning Trauma (self-induced or accidental) Meningitis/encephalitis Schizophrenia Sepsis SSRI toxicity [3] [4] [13]
