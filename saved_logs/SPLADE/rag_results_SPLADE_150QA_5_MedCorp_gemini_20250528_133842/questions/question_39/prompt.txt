Document 1 (Title: Abnormal renal glucose handling in X-linked hypophosphataemic mice.): 1. The renal handling of glucose was determined in male X-linked hypophosphataemic (Hyp/Y) mice and in control littermates (+/Y) aged 4 months. Plasma glucose concentration and urinary glucose excretion were measured before and during stepwise increase in glycaemia induced by an acute infusion of glucose. The relationship between plasma glucose concentration and urinary glucose excretion was monitored per ml of glomerular filtrate in mice fed high and low phosphate diets. 2. Hyp/Y mice fed the high phosphate diet showed a significantly higher glucosuria compared with +/Y littermates. When glycaemia was increased, Hyp/Y mice developed frank glucosuria earlier than +/Y animals. In Hyp/Y mice we could not find a threshold below which virtually no glucose was excreted in the urine, whereas this was clearly visible in +/Y mice. These differences persisted in animals fed the low phosphate diet. 3. Using the acute response to the glucoregulatory hormones, glucagon and insulin, administered exogenously, we found that the regulation of plasma glucose concentration did not differ between Hyp/Y and +/Y mice. 4. The significantly lower plasma glucose concentration observed in Hyp/Y as compared with +/Y mice decreased further during fasting. 5. We conclude that the renal reabsorptive capacity for glucose is defective in Hyp/Y mice and their low plasma glucose concentration may be explained by the renal leak. Therefore the X-linked phosphataemic mouse appears not only to be characterized by a defect in renal phosphate and calcium reabsorption but also by an altered glucose reabsorption.
Document 2 (Title: Genetics, Inducible Operon -- Molecular Level): Extracellular glucose can also regulate the lac operon by carbon catabolite repression (CCR), a phenomenon formerly called the "glucose effect." The phosphoenolpyruvate: carbohydrate phosphotransferase system (PTS) couples the transport and phosphorylation of glucose as it moves into the cell and plays a central role in exerting the effects of glucose on the expression of the lac operon. The transfer of a phosphate group from phosphoenolpyruvate to glucose occurs in 2 steps, each catalyzed by different proteins. The phosphoryl group is first accepted by enzyme I and HPr, which transfers it to a sugar-specific Enzyme II. Enzyme II, which is specific for transporting glucose, is EIIAGlc. As glucose levels increase in the environment, they are transported into the cells and phosphorylated by EIIAGlc. Dephosphorylated EIIAGlc binds to LacY and prevents the formation of lac permease. This blocks the entry of lactose into the cell, decreasing the intracellular concentration of the inducer, a phenomenon called inducer exclusion. This ensures that the cells use glucose and that other carbon sources, such as lactose, are not metabolized. [19] [20]
Document 3 (Title: UTP—glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase): In higher animals, the enzyme is highly active in tissues involved in glycogenesis, including the liver and the muscles. An exception is the brain, which has high levels of glycogen but low specific activity of UTP—glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase. In animal cells, UTP—glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase is found predominantly in the cytoplasm. UTP—glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase is also required for galactose metabolism in animals and microorganisms. In galactose metabolism, the enzyme galactose 1-phosphate uridylyltransferase transfers a phosphate from UDP-glucose to galactose 1-phosphate to produce UDP-galactose, which is then converted to UDP-glucose. Bacteria with defective UTP—glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase are unable to incorporate galactose into their cell walls.
Document 4 (Title: Biochemistry_Lippinco): For fructose to enter the pathways of intermediary metabolism, it must first be phosphorylated (Fig. 12.2). This can be accomplished by either hexokinase or fructokinase. Hexokinase phosphorylates glucose in most cells of the body (see p. 98), and several additional hexoses can serve as substrates for this enzyme. However, it has a low affinity (that is, a high Michaelis constant [Km]; see p. 59) for fructose. Therefore, unless the intracellular concentration of fructose becomes unusually high, the normal presence of saturating concentrations of glucose means that little fructose is phosphorylated by hexokinase. Fructokinase provides the primary mechanism for fructose phosphorylation (see Fig. 12.2). The enzyme has a low Km for fructose and a high Vmax ([maximal velocity] see p. 57). It is found in the liver (which processes most of the dietary fructose), kidneys, and the small intestine and converts fructose to fructose 1-phosphate, using ATP as the phosphate donor. [Note: These
Document 5 (Title: Cell_Biology_Alberts): The success of living organisms is attributable to a cell’s ability to make enzymes of many types, each with precisely specified properties. Each enzyme Figure 2–23 enzymes cannot change the equilibrium point for reactions. enzymes, like all catalysts, speed up the forward and backward rates of a reaction by the same factor. Therefore, for both the catalyzed and the uncatalyzed reactions shown here, the number of molecules undergoing the transition X → Y is equal to the number of molecules undergoing the transition Y → X when the ratio of Y molecules to X molecules is 3 to 1. in other words, the two reactions reach equilibrium at exactly the same point.

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
Question: A researcher is studying the properties of an enzyme that adds phosphate groups to glucose. She discovers that the enzyme is present in most body tissues and is located in the cytoplasm of the cells expressing the enzyme. She decides to mix this enzyme under subphysiologic conditions with varying levels of glucose in order to determine the kinetic properties of the enzyme. Specifically, she adds increasing levels of glucose at a saturating concentration of phosphate and sees that the rate at which glucose becomes phosphorylated gets faster at higher levels of glucose. She observes that this rate approaches a maximum speed and calls this speed Y. She then determines the concentration of glucose that is needed to make the enzyme function at half the speed Y and calls this concentration X. Which of the following is most likely true about the properties of this enzyme?
Options:
A. High X and high Y
B. High X and low Y
C. Low X and high Y
D. Low X and low Y
