        "content": "Pregnancy is occasionally complicated by infections that necessitate antibiotic therapy. When considering therapeutic options for pregnant women, both the physiologic changes of pregnancy and the prenatal effects of the drug must be weighed. Antibiotics should be selected with regard to the trimester of pregnancy. Some antibiotics are safe for use throughout pregnancy, while others are completely contraindicated. Choosing the proper antibiotic requires balancing the seriousness of the infection with the antibiotic's safety and antimicrobial activity.",

In contrast, using 2 or more agents for immunocompromised hosts is preferable, with at least 1 demonstrating good macrophage penetration. Antibiotic options include vancomycin, linezolid, carbapenems, fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, macrolides, and rifampin. When the central nervous system (CNS) is involved, selecting multiple agents with good CNS penetration is favored. [23] [24] [25] [26]",

        "content": "Treatment The antibiotics erythromycin, clarithromycin, or azithromycin are typically the recommended treatment. Newer macrolides are frequently recommended due to lower rates of side effects. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) may be used in those with allergies to first-line agents or in infants who have a risk of pyloric stenosis from macrolides. A reasonable guideline is to treat people age >1 year within 3 weeks of cough onset and infants age <1 year and pregnant women within 6 weeks of cough onset. If the person is diagnosed late, antibiotics will not alter the course of the illness, and even without antibiotics, they should no longer be spreading pertussis. When used early, antibiotics decrease the duration of infectiousness, and thus prevent spread. Short-term antibiotics (azithromycin for 3\u20135 days) are as effective as long-term treatment (erythromycin 10\u201314 days) in eliminating B. pertussis with fewer and less severe side effects.",

Ten percent of women require readmission to the hospital for postembolization syndrome, characterized by diffuse abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, low-grade fever, malaise, anorexia, and leucocytosis. Treatment with intravenous \ufb02uids, NSAID medications, and pain management usually leads to resolution of symptoms within 2 to 3 days (165). Persistent fever should be managed with antibiotics. Failure to respond to antibiotics may indicate sepsis, which needs to be aggressively managed with hysterectomy.",
