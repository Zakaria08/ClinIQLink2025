Document 1 (Title: Lambert–Eaton myasthenic syndrome): Signs and symptoms The weakness from LEMS typically involves the muscles of the proximal arms and legs (the muscles closer to the trunk). In contrast to myasthenia gravis, the weakness affects the legs more than the arms. This leads to difficulties climbing stairs and rising from a sitting position. Weakness is often relieved temporarily after exertion or physical exercise. High temperatures can worsen the symptoms. Weakness of the bulbar muscles (muscles of the mouth and throat) is occasionally encountered. Weakness of the eye muscles is uncommon. Some may have double vision, drooping of the eyelids and difficulty swallowing, but generally only together with leg weakness; this too distinguishes LEMS from myasthenia gravis, in which eye signs are much more common. In the advanced stages of the disease, weakness of the respiratory muscles may occur. Some may also experience problems with coordination (ataxia).
Document 2 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): Introduction to Autonomic Pharmacology Bertram G. Katzung, MD, PhD A 56-year-old woman is brought to the university eye center with a complaint of “loss of vision.” Because of visual impair-ment, she has lost her driver’s license and has fallen several times in her home. Examination reveals that her eyelids close involuntarily with a frequency and duration sufficient to pre-vent her from seeing her surroundings for more than brief moments at a time. When she holds her eyelids open with her fingers, she can see normally. She has no other muscle dysfunction. A diagnosis of blepharospasm is made. Using a fine needle, several injections of botulinum toxin type A are made in the orbicularis oculi muscle of each eyelid. After observation in the waiting area, she is sent home. Two days later, she reports by telephone that her vision has improved dramatically. How did botulinum toxin improve her vision? How long can her vision be expected to remain normal after this single treatment?
Document 3 (Title: Gordon Reflex -- Clinical Significance): The Gordon reflex can be clinically significant when assessing various diseases and neurological deficits. A positive or abnormal response correlates with a lesion in the pyramidal tract, an upper motor neuron sign that can help shape a differential diagnosis. [1] Diseases that can cause pyramidal tract lesions or damage to the corticospinal tract include strokes, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, encephalitis, and brain or spinal cord tumors, to name a few. A broad differential comes along with upper motor neuron lesions. Gordon first demonstrated the reflex in a patient with hemorrhagic pachymeningitis and later in a patient with epilepsy shortly after generalized convulsions. Gordon believed that the reflex was a sign of cerebral irritation or a beginning lesion of the motor pathway. At the same time, he thought that the Babinski reflex was a sign of a well-established lesion of the motor pathway. One double-blind study examining the consistency of the Babinski reflex and its variants, including the Gordon reflex, examined both inter-observer consistency and intra-observer consistency of the reflex variants. [1] The Gordon reflex was given a fair rating for inter-observer consistency with a kappa of 0.3515 (95% CI = 0.255-0.448) and the highest intra-observer consistency with a kappa of 0.6731. [1] Therefore, the Gordon reflex is a good adjunct to the Babinski reflex and should be used, especially when a practitioner cannot elicit a Babinski reflex or gets an equivocal result.
Document 4 (Title: Granuloma Inguinale -- Complications): A 33-year-old woman from Madurai presented to Rajaji Hospital after complaining of white vaginal discharged and prolonged menstrual periods. She was found to have ulcers of the cervix and vaginal vault with areas of necrosis. Donovan bodies were found in the ulcer smears. She was initially treated with streptomycin, then switched to tetracycline when she could not tolerate the side effects of the first medication. She was noted to significantly improve with decreased ulcer size and less discharge after 20 days of treatment. Two months after treatment, she reported a complete resolution of her symptoms and was noted to be symptom-free after 1 year.
Document 5 (Title: [Reducing body myopathy--a case report].): A 2-year-old girl with reducing body myopathy was reported. She had no family history of neuromuscular disease. She developed normally with no delay in milestones during infancy. She had no muscle weakness or hypotonia up to 2 years of age when she received mumps vaccination. Three days after the injection, she was first noticed to have limb muscle weakness. The muscle weakness progressed rapidly with increasing difficulty in gait and raising the upper arms, particularly the left. Four months later, she had difficulty in keeping her head up and could no longer climb the stairs. On physical examination, she had proximal dominant generalized muscle weakness, with a preferential neck muscle involvement. She walked waddlingly and stood up with Gowers' maneuver. Facial and ocular muscles were intact. No dysarthria, dysphagia or respiratory difficulty was noted. EMG showed myopathic pattern. Serum creatine kinase level was moderately elevated to 739 IU/l. In the biopsied left biceps muscle, there was marked variation in fiber size, but no apparent necrotic or regenerating fibers. The most striking feature was the presence of numerous eosinophilic inclusions which reduced nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) and were, therefore, stained dark with menadione-linked alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase even without the substrate of menadione, showing the histochemical characteristics of "reducing" body. The bodies were predominantly seen in fibers with disorganized intermyofibrillar networks and with high acid phosphatase activity. On electron microscopy, the reducing bodies consisted of fine granular material with the similar electron density to the chromatin granules and were located mostly around the degenerated nuclei, suggesting the nuclear degeneration playing a role in forming the reducing bodies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
Question: A 35-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 1-month history of double vision, difficulty climbing stairs, and weakness when trying to brush her hair. She reports that these symptoms are worse after she exercises and disappear after she rests for a few hours. Physical examination shows drooping of her right upper eyelid that worsens when the patient is asked to gaze at the ceiling for 2 minutes. There is diminished motor strength in the upper extremities. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options:
A. Myasthenia gravis
B. Polymyositis
C. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
D. Multiple sclerosis
