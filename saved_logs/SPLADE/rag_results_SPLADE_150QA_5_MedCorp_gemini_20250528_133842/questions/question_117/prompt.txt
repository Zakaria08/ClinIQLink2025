Document 1 (Title: Renal Failure (Archived) -- Introduction -- Chronic Renal Failure (CRF)): CRF or chronic kidney disease (CKD) is defined as a persistent impairment of kidney function, in other words, abnormally elevated serum creatinine for more than 3 months or calculated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) less than 60 ml per minute / 1.73m2. It often involves a progressive loss of kidney function necessitating renal replacement therapy (dialysis or transplantation). When a patient needs renal replacement therapy, the condition is called end-stage renal disease (ESRD). [1] CKD classified based on grade: Grade 1: GFR greater than 90 Grade 2: 60 to 89 Grade 3a: 45 to 59 Grade 3b: 30 to 44 Grade 4: 15 to 29 Grade 5: Less than 15 CKD classified based on stage: Stage 1: GFR greater than 90 Stage 2: 60 to 89 Stage 3: 30 to 59 Stage 4: 15 to 29 Stage 5: Less than 15
Document 2 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Once GFR reduction has been established, the physician must decide if it represents acute or chronic renal injury. The clinical situation, history, and laboratory data often make this an easy distinction. However, the laboratory abnormalities characteristic of chronic renal failure, including anemia, hypocalcemia, and hyperphosphatemia, often are present as well in patients presenting with acute renal failure. Radiographic evidence of renal osteodystrophy (Chap. 335) can be seen only in chronic renal failure but is a very late finding, and these patients are usually undergoing dialysis. The urinalysis and renal ultrasound can facilitate distinguishing acute from chronic renal failure. An approach to the evaluation of azotemic patients is shown in Fig. 61-1. Patients with advanced chronic renal insufficiency often have some proteinuria, nonconcentrated urine (isosthenuria; isosmotic with plasma), and small kidneys on ultrasound, characterized by increased echogenicity and cortical
Document 3 (Title: Lupus nephritis: prognostic factors in children.): As newer treatment modalities become available for patients with severe lupus nephritis, it becomes increasingly important to identify patients at risk for renal failure. In this study, the records of 90 children presenting with systemic lupus erythematosus over a 13-year period were reviewed. Nineteen were lost to follow-up prior to completion of the study. Of the 71 remaining children, 16 (22%) progressed to chronic renal failure. Persistent hypertension lasting greater than 4 months, anemia, abnormalities of the urinalysis, and elevated serum creatinine level were significantly associated with progression to renal failure. Sex, race, age, abnormalities of creatinine clearance, and 24-hour urine protein collection were not associated with progression to renal failure. Renal biopsies were obtained in 45 children. Biopsies were initially classified according to World Health Organization criteria. Diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis was significantly associated with progression to renal failure. The 45 biopsies available were reviewed by one of the authors and categorized by activity and chronicity indices. Both the active lesions of fibrinoid necrosis, synechiae, tubular casts, and vasculitic lesions and the chronic lesion of glomerular sclerosis correlated with progression to renal failure. Of the 16 children who progressed to renal failure, 2 had cadaver kidney transplants and are well 5 years posttransplant; 4 had fulminant lupus and died within 1 month of commencing dialysis; 10 began chronic dialysis. Five of the 10 children on chronic dialysis died from sepsis. These data suggest that children with systemic lupus erythematosus who undergo dialysis do poorly.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Document 4 (Title: Kidney failure): In the United States acute failure affects about 3 per 1,000 people a year. Chronic failure affects about 1 in 1,000 people with 3 per 10,000 people newly developing the condition each year. Acute failure is often reversible while chronic failure often is not. With appropriate treatment many with chronic disease can continue working. Classification Kidney failure can be divided into two categories: acute kidney failure or chronic kidney failure. The type of renal failure is differentiated by the trend in the serum creatinine; other factors that may help differentiate acute kidney failure from chronic kidney failure include anemia and the kidney size on sonography as chronic kidney disease generally leads to anemia and small kidney size. Acute kidney failure
Document 5 (Title: Valsartan): Kidney failure People treated with ARBs including valsartan or diuretics are susceptible to conditions of developing low renal blood flow such as abnormal narrowing of blood vessel in kidney, hypertension, renal artery stenosis, heart failure, chronic kidney disease, severe congestive heart failure, or volume depletion whose renal function is in part dependent on the activity of the renin-angiotensin system like efferent arteriolar vasoconstriction done by angiotensin II are at high risk of deterioration of renal function comprising acute kidney failure, oliguria, worsening azotemia or heightened serum creatinine. When blood flow to the kidneys is reduced, the kidney activates a series of response that triggers angiotensin release to constrict blood vessels and facilitate blood flow in the kidney. So long as the nephron function degradation is being progressive or reaches clinically significant level, withhold or discontinue valsartan is warranted. Interactions
