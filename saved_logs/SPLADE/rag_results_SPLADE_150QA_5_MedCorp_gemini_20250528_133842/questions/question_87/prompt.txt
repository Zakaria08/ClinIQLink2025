Document 1 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): radiographic imaging with CT scan, positron emission tomography (PET), or preferably CT-PET. PET scanning attempts to identify sites of malignancy based on glucose metabolism by measuring the uptake of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). Rapidly dividing cells, presumably in the lung tumors, will preferentially take up 18F-FDG and appear as a “hot spot.” To date, PET has been mostly used for staging and detection of metastases in lung cancer and in the detection of nodules >15 mm in diameter. Combined 18F-FDG PET-CT imaging has been shown to improve the accuracy of staging in NSCLC compared to visual correlation of PET and CT or either study alone. CT-PET has been found to be superior in identifying pathologically enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes and extrathoracic metastases. A standardized uptake value (SUV) of >2.5 on PET is highly suspicious for malignancy. False negatives can be seen in diabetes, in lesions <8 mm, and in slow-growing tumors (e.g., carcinoid tumors or well-differentiated

Positron emission tomog-raphy (PET) is used for imaging tissues with high levels of anaerobic glycolysis, such as malignant tumors. 13F-fluorode-oxyglucose (FDG) is injected as a tracer; metabolism of this molecule then results in positron emission. PET has been used as an adjunct to CT in the staging of colorectal cancer and may prove useful in discriminating recurrent cancer from fibrosis. By combining PET and CT technology (PET/CT), anatomic correlation between regions of high isotope accumulation (“hot spots”) on PET and abnormalities on CT can be determined. PET/CT increasingly is used to diagnose recurrent and/or meta-static colorectal cancer. However, the efficacy and utility of this technology remains unproven.Scintigraphy to Assess Gastrointestinal Bleeding.

Document 3 (Title: Fluorodeoxyglucose (18F)): Applications In PET imaging, 18F-FDG is primarily used for imaging tumors in oncology, where a static 18F-FDG PET scan is performed and the tumor 18F-FDG uptake is analyzed in terms of Standardized Uptake Value (SUV). FDG PET/CT can be used for the assessment of glucose metabolism in the heart and the brain. 18F-FDG is taken up by cells, phosphorylated by hexokinase (whose mitochondrial form is greatly elevated in rapidly growing malignant tumours), and retained by tissues with high metabolic activity, such as most types of malignant tumours. As a result, FDG-PET can be used for diagnosis, staging, and monitoring treatment of cancers, particularly in Hodgkin's disease, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, colorectal cancer, breast cancer, melanoma, and lung cancer. It has also been approved for use in diagnosing Alzheimer's disease.
Document 4 (Title: Uptake of 2-deoxy, 2-(18F) fluoro-D-glucose in bladder cancer: animal localization and initial patient positron emission tomography.): An orthotopically transplanted, locally metastasizing rat bladder tumor model was developed to evaluate the extent of uptake of fluoro-deoxy-glucose (FDG) in bladder cancer. Significant uptake of FDG in localized bladder tumors in rats was shown, with an average tumor-to-blood ratio of 39 at 2 hours after intravenous FDG administration. Metastases (3 nodal and 1 peritoneal) also showed significant uptake of FDG, with an average metastasis-to-blood ratio of 21.7, and tumor involved-to-normal lymph node ratio of 5.3. Because FDG is excreted in the urine, urinary FDG potentially could prevent the use of FDG/positron emission tomography (FDG/PET) scanning for localized bladder cancer. Bladder lavage successfully reduced the retention of FDG in the normal rat bladder, with an estimated uptake ratio of tumor-to-normal bladder of 13.1 after 5 ml. saline irrigation. Based on these data, we performed an FDG/PET scan of a patient with biopsy proved recurrent intravesical bladder cancer after radiation therapy. Computerized tomography (CT) of the pelvis showed abnormalities consistent with radiation scarring and extravesical tumor. Due to the scarring, the extent of tumor growth could not be determined. The patient also had pulmonary opacities seen on chest radiography. The FDG/PET scan of this patient showed significant extravesical uptake in the pelvis, confirming the abnormality noted on CT. Good images of the clinically apparent metastases in the chest also were obtained. These preliminary data indicate that FDG/PET imaging of bladder cancer is feasible and it may provide new information for the diagnosis and staging of patients with bladder cancer.
Document 5 (Title: Fludeoxyglucose (18F) -- Administration -- Special Population): COVID-19 Vaccination: Transient FDG uptake in axillary, supraclavicular, and cervical lymph nodes is noted after ipsilateral deltoid vaccination, which may confound interpretation in patients with cancer FDG PET/CT. [23] Therefore, the COVID-19 Task Force Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (SNMMI) recommends that it is essential to acknowledge that FDG-avid lymphadenopathy can occur in the axillary, lower cervical, and supraclavicular lymph nodes ipsilateral to the vaccination site. FDG-avid lymphadenopathy can be seen for 4 to 6 weeks or longer after the most recent dose of the vaccination. Consequently, questionnaires should be revised to include details about the dates and sites of vaccination and which vaccine was administered. If possible, the COVID-19 vaccination should be administered in the contralateral arm for patients with a history of breast, head, and neck cancers. These recommendations may help oncologists decide the appropriate workup and suggest that breast cancer patients be vaccinated on their healthy side to avoid unnecessary biopsies. In approximately half the patients receiving the novel mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine, PET/CT demonstrated avid ipsilateral lymphadenopathy, significantly less common in immunocompromised and elderly patients. These results suggest that 18F-FDG PET/CT may give a clue regarding the patient's immune response to the vaccination. [24]
