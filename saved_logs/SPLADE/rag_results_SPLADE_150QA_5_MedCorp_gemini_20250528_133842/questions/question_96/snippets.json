        "content": "IV-DSA has also been useful in assessing patients prior to surgery and after coronary artery bypass surgery and some transplant operations. Applications DSA is primarily used to image blood vessels. It is useful in the diagnosis and treatment of arterial and venous occlusions, including carotid artery stenosis, pulmonary embolisms, and acute limb ischaemia; arterial stenosis, which is particularly useful for potential kidney donors in detecting renal artery stenosis (DSA is the gold standard investigation for renal artery stenosis); cerebral aneurysms and arteriovenous malformations (AVM). The future DSA is done less and less routinely in imaging departments. It is being replaced by computed tomography angiography (CTA), which can produce 3D images through a test which is less invasive and stressful for the patient, and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), which avoids X-rays and nephrotoxic contrast agents.",

        "title": "Quantitative assessment of coronary arterial diameter before and after coronary artery bypass grafting.",
        "content": "Because coronary artery bypass graft patency is related to the size of the artery, a preoperative assessment of arterial diameter is important. However, the relation between coronary arterial diameter (assessed by angiography) and true luminal size of arteries that are occluded and filled by collaterals has not been completely characterized. This study was done to measure the luminal diameter of coronary arteries before and after bypass grafting. Twenty-six patients (20 men and 6 women, aged 34 to 72 years) had coronary angiography before and from 1 to 35 months after bypass surgery. Coronary arterial luminal diameter was similar before and after operation for the 18 insignificantly narrowed arteries and the 24 arteries with narrowings that filled by anterograde flow before operation and were bypassed. In contrast, in the 21 arteries that were occluded and filled by collateral flow, coronary arterial diameter was significantly larger (p less than 0.001) after operation. Thus, when a coronary artery is occluded and filled by collaterals, its true luminal size is consistently underestimated by the angiogram.",

        "content": "Given that carotid stenosis is an atherosclerotic process, it is not surprising that a significant portion of patients with severe carotid stenosis have concurrent coronary artery disease (CAD). In patients who need coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) and who are known to have severe (>70%) but asymptomatic carotid stenosis, the question arises regarding performing CEA before or at the same time as the CABG. A randomized control trial of 185 patients showed significant benefit for CEA either prior to or at the same time as CABG compared to patients who underwent CEA 1 to 3 months after CABG. The delayed CEA group had a significantly increased risk of perioperative or delayed stroke. [10]",
