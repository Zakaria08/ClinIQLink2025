Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease itself has four main forms, the sporadic (sCJD), the hereditary/familial (fCJD), the iatrogenic (iCJD) and the variant form (vCJD). These conditions form a spectrum of diseases with overlapping signs and symptoms. TSEs in non-human mammals include scrapie in sheep, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in cattle \u2013 popularly known as \"mad cow disease\" \u2013 and chronic wasting disease (CWD) in deer and elk. The variant form of Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease in humans is caused by exposure to bovine spongiform encephalopathy prions.",

She was diag-nosed with Crohn\u2019s disease 2 years ago, and it involves her terminal ileum and proximal colon, as confirmed by colonoscopy and small bowel radiography. She was initially treated with mesalamine and budesonide with good response, but over the last 2 months, she has had a relapse of her symptoms. She is experiencing fatigue, cramping, abdominal pains, and nonbloody diarrhea up to 10 times daily, and she has had a 15-lb weight loss. She has no other significant medical or surgical his-tory. Her current medications are mesalamine 2.4 g/d and budesonide 9 mg/d. She appears thin and tired. Abdominal examination reveals tenderness without guarding in the right lower quadrant; no masses are palpable. On perianal examination, there is no tenderness, fissure, or fistula. Her laboratory data are notable for anemia and elevated C-reactive protein. What are the options for immediate",

        "content": "Serial brain CT and 123I-IMP SPECT were examined in a case with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). A 61-year-old woman had the onset of progressive dementia and gait disturbance in December 1988. Then, she developed left hemiparesis and dysarthria, and rapidly fell into akinetic mutism within about 2 months. Brain CT, MRI, and CSF findings showed no definite abnormalities. In February 1989, myoclonic movements appeared in several parts of the body and EEG revealed periodic synchronous discharges. Myoclonus was observed most frequently from March to May 1989, and then reduced gradually. She died in June 1990, and the total clinical course was 19 months. Brain atrophy on CT started from about 4 months after the onset, and progressed subacutely. At the end stage of the disease, diffuse brain atrophy including the cerebellum and the brain stem on CT was observed. SPECT revealed decreased perfusion in the cerebral cortex from 5 months after the onset to the end stage, but; perfusion in the cerebellum and the basal ganglia was relatively kept even at the end stage of the disease. The results suggest that SPECT is a useful examination for presumption of the pathological processes in CJD.",

        "content": "We report a 21-year-old woman in whom chorea was associated with antiphospholipid antibodies. In August 1986, she developed involuntary movement which started in the right hand but subsided spontaneously. In September 1988, she again developed right-sided involuntary movements which started in the right hand but rapidly progressed to involve the whole of the right side. In September 1990, she was admitted to our hospital for investigation of choreiform movements, because her involuntary movements had progressed to involve all four extremities. She had no family or past history of chorea, psychiatric, rheumatological or vascular disease. On admission, she had difficulty in speaking and swallowing due to choreiform movements of her mouth and tongue. Her gait was unsteady. On walking she had wild gyrations of the arms. Choreiform movements of all four extremities, neck, face, mouth and tongue were present at rest, more marked on the right side. There was no other neurological deficits. She had none of the classical features of SLE. She had none of the complications commonly associated with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS) (i.e., recurrent spontaneous abortion, thrombosis and thrombocytopenia). Laboratory tests revealed that antinuclear antibody was present. Cardiolipin antibody (VDRL) was positive but specific tests for syphilis were negative. Anticardiolipin antibodies were present. All coagulation studies have failed to reveal lupus anticoagulant. Brain CT, MRI, 123IMP-SPECT and cerebral angiography were normal. Associated with her chorea, she had the serological but not the clinical features of APS. We suggest that antiphospholipid antibodies should be looked for in all unexplained cases of chorea, even when the associated clinical signs of APS are absent.",
