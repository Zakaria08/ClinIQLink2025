        "content": "Trimethoprim has shown to have activity against a variety of Gram-positive bacterial pathogens. However, resistance to trimethoprim and other drugs aimed at DHFR can arise due to a variety of mechanisms, limiting the success of their therapeutical uses. Resistance can arise from DHFR gene amplification, mutations in DHFR, decrease in the uptake of the drugs, among others. Regardless, trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole in combination has been used as an antibacterial agent for decades. Folate is necessary for growth, and the pathway of the metabolism of folate is a target in developing treatments for cancer. DHFR is one such target. A regimen of fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and methotrexate was shown to prolong survival in patients with advanced gastric cancer. Further studies into inhibitors of DHFR can lead to more ways to treat cancer. Bacteria also need DHFR to grow and multiply and hence inhibitors selective for bacterial DHFR have found application as antibacterial agents.",

        "content": "The synergism of the compounds Nd-(4-methoxy-1,2,5-thiadiazol-3-yl)-sulfanilamide (sulfametrole; SOL) and 2,4-diamino-5-(3',4',5'-trimethoxy-benzyl)-pyrimidine (trimethoprim; TMP) contained in the preparation Lidaprim was proved in vitro in the agar dilution test, the disc agar diffusion method as well as a crossover test against various grampositive and gramnegative bacteria. Sulfametrole enhanced the activity of trimethoprim or its activity was intensified by trimethoprim, respectively. The increase in efficiency depends on the primary sensitivity or resistance of the bacteria against trimethoprim and/or the sulfonamide. The combination of trimethoprim + sulfametrole (1 + 20) had the same antibacterial activity as the combination co-trimoxazole = trimethoprim + Nd-(5-methyl-3-isoxazolyl)-sulfanilamide (sulfamethoxazole; SMZ). The bactericidal efficiency was shown against a strain of E. coli. Using the combination experimental development of resistance against various bacteria could not be obtained (10 times repeated contact with subbacteriostatic concentrations). Chemotherapeutical experiments in the mouse have confirmed the enhancement indicated in vitro of the combination trimethoprim-sulfonamide, irrespective of the sulfonamides chosen. Determinations of the intestinal flora before, during and after oral administration of 2 X 2 tablets SOL-TMP (Lidaprim) over a period of 10 days showed that the absolute number of bacteria in samples of faeces had not been reduced. Enterobacteria and anaerobic lactobacilli (L. bifidus), which could not be identified during the period of administration, reappeared after the end of therapy.",

        "content": "Mechanism of Action Trimethoprim, a trimethoxybenzylpyrimidine, selectively inhibits bacterial dihydrofolic acid reductase, which converts dihydrofolic acid to tetrahydrofolic acid, a step leading to the synthesis of purines and ultimately to DNA (Figure 46\u20132). Trimethoprim is a much less efficient inhibitor of mammalian dihydrofolic acid reductase. The combination of trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole is often bactericidal, compared with the bacteriostatic activity of a sulfonamide alone.",
