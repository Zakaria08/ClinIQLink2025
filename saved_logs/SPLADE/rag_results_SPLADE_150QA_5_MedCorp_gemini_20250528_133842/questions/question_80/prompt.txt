Document 1 (Title: Operation Smile): Operation Smile offers education in safe surgical conditions in Ethiopia and Rwanda, where they have offered surgical training rotations for general surgeons to learn reconstructive plastic surgery techniques — since 2012 in Ethiopia and since 2015 in Rwanda. The two-week training courses for Ethiopian surgeons, anesthesiologists and nurses take place at JUSH (Jimma University Specialized Hospital), the only hospital serving the 15 million-plus people living in Ethiopia’s southwestern region. The rotations cover cleft surgery as well as techniques to better heal burn, trauma and surgical wounds, representing the bulk of the hospital’s plastic surgery cases.
Document 2 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): surgeryLaparoscopic surgerySeamless surgeryProgress in surgeryfor all surgeons. This technology has the advantage of enabling objective measurement of psychomotor skills, which can be used to determine progress in skill acquisition and, ultimately, techni-cal competency.101 Several of these devices have been validated as a means of measuring proficiency in skill performance. More importantly, training on virtual reality platforms has proven to translate to improved operative performance in randomized tri-als.102,103 Currently, surgical skills labs are mandatory for Resi-dency Review Committee credentialing. Successful completion of the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS) technical and cognitive examination became a mandatory prerequisite for the American Board of Surgery (ABS) qualification examination in general surgery in 2010. The Fundamentals of Endoscopic Surgery (FES) became a prerequisite to ABS qualification in 2015. In the future, institutions may require simulator
Document 3 (Title: Influence of clerkship structure and timing on individual student performance.): Student oral and written surgical clerkship performances may be related to the clerkship structure and the time of year the students rotate through the clerkship. The influence of calendar block, hospital site (university hospital, affiliated private tertiary-care hospital, and rural preceptor experience), and the mix of general surgical versus subspeciality rotations on oral and written student surgery clerkship scores was analyzed. Multivariate analysis of variance revealed significant differences in score for calendar block (p = 0.02) only; this difference resided in the written examination. The various combinations of rotations were not different from one another in terms of measured outcome.
Document 4 (Title: Mohs Micrographic Surgery Design and Execution of Rotation Flaps -- Continuing Education Activity): Objectives: Identify patients with primary surgical defects that may benefit from closure with a surgical rotational flap. Apply best practices when designing and executing a rotational flap during a Mohs micrographic surgical procedure. Evaluate and manage the common complications of surgical rotational flaps in Mohs micrographic surgery. Develop and implement effective interprofessional team strategies to improve cosmetic and functional outcomes for patients who have undergone rotational flap closure. Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.
Document 5 (Title: Mohs Micrographic Surgery Design and Execution of Rotation Flaps -- Continuing Education Activity): Mohs micrographic surgery creates defects requiring various closure techniques to optimize function and cosmesis in the cosmetic units of the face. Surgical rotational flaps are a subtype of random pattern cutaneous flaps that pivot into their final position, differing from traditional advancement flaps. A rotational flap may be indicated for triangular-shaped defects or those where the tension vector of the primary wound requires alteration. This activity reviews the indications, contraindications, complications, and surgical technique of designing and employing a surgical rotational flap in patients undergoing Mohs micrographic surgery and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients treated with this closure method.
