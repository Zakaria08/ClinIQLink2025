Document 1 (Title: A novel endoscopic transgastric fundoplication procedure for gastroesophageal reflux: an initial animal evaluation.): Complications of gastroesophageal reflux are common in adults and children. A variety of surgical procedures have been successfully used to treat this condition. All current techniques require open surgery and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality, particularly in the high risk, neurologically damaged child. The authors have developed a novel method of creating a gastric fundoplication using an endoscopic transgastric approach in pigs. The procedure involves the creation of an esophageal intussusception into the stomach under direct vision with an endoscope. The gastric fundus is then plicated around the esophagus using a custom stapling device. The transgastric approach allows creation of a fundoplication, is easily performed, is potentially effective at preventing gastroesophageal reflux, and has the obvious advantages of minimally invasive surgery over open techniques of fundoplication.

Document 3 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): barriers to expansion. To date, the most headline-grabbing procedures have been the transvaginal and transgastric removal of the gallbladder84-86 (Fig. 14-25). To ensure safety, all human cases thus far have involved laparoscopic assistance to aid in retrac-tion and ensure adequate closure of the stomach or vagina. To date, thousands of transvaginal and transgastric procedures have been performed internationally, with two large registries dem-onstrating noninferiority to conventional laparoscopy.87 The fact that the vast majority of these procedures are being done trans-vaginally creates an obvious limitation in applicability.The rapid growth of endoscopic technology catalyzed by NOTES has already spun off new technologies capable of performing a wide variety of endoscopic surgical procedures from EMR, to ablation of Barrett’s esophagus, to creation of competent antireflux valves in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease.Peroral esophageal myotomy (POEM) has shown promise as a
Document 4 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): fibers into bundles, one for illu-mination and one for imaging. The earliest upper endoscopes revolutionized the diagnosis and treatment of gastroesophageal reflux and peptic ulcer disease and made possible early detec-tion of upper and lower gastrointestinal (GI) cancer at a stage that could be cured. The first endoscopic surgical procedure was the colonoscopic polypectomy, developed by Shinya and Wolfe, two surgeons from New York City. The percutane-ous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) invented by Gauderer and Ponsky may have been the first NOTES procedure, reported in 1981.5 Endoscopic pancreatic pseudocyst drainage is thought to be the next NOTES procedure developed; however, there was little energy and money put into the development of NOTES until a number of gastroenterologists claimed the ability to remove the gallbladder with a flexible endoscope, using a transgastric technique. With this pronouncement, the surgical community took notice and seized the momentum for NOTES
Document 5 (Title: Neuroanatomy, Inferior Colliculus -- Surgical Considerations): Another surgery in this area is the placement of an IC implant, which works similarly to a cochlear implant but is utilized in those with cochlear nerve damage. These implants may be used especially for those with neurofibromatosis-2 whose cochlear nerves suffer damage upon removal of schwannomas of CN VIII. A trans-labyrinthine or retrosigmoid approach with possible endoscopic aid may be the best approach to the area surgically, and brainstem auditory evoked potentials (discussed below) can be monitored during surgery to avoid damage to auditory pathways.
