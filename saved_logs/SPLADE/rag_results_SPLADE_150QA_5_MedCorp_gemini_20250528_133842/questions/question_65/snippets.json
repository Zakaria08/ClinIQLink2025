        "content": "Palliative medicine Systemic immediate release opioids are beneficial in emergently reducing the symptom of shortness of breath due to both cancer and non cancer causes; long-acting/sustained-release opioids are also used to prevent/continue treatment of dyspnea in palliative setting. There is a lack of evidence to recommend midazolam, nebulised opioids, the use of gas mixtures, or cognitive-behavioral therapy. Non-pharmacological techniques Non-pharmacological interventions provide key tools for the management of breathlessness. Potentially beneficial approaches include active management of psychosocial issues (anxiety, depression, etc.), and implementation of self-management strategies, such as physical and mental relaxation techniques, pacing techniques, energy conservation techniques, learning exercises to control breathing, and education. The use of a fan may also be beneficial. Cognitive behavioural therapy may also be helpful.",

        "content": "Dyspnea on exertion is a frequently reported symptom of thyrotoxicosis. In the majority of cases, there is no obvious cause of dyspnea, but as skeletal myopathy is also common in thyrotoxic patients, it has been postulated that increased dyspnea could be secondary to respiratory muscle weakness. We sought to determine whether thyrotoxic patients were in fact more dyspneic on exertion than age- and sex-matched controls, and if so, whether the increased dyspnea was secondary to respiratory muscle weakness. The study group consisted of 12 thyrotoxic patients and 12 control subjects matched for age and gender. We measured lung volumes, compliance, elastic recoil, respiratory muscle strength, maximal exercise performance, and the intensity of breathlessness (modified Borg scale) at various levels of exercise in all subjects. The respiratory muscles were weaker in patients than controls. This weakness improved in treated patients (p less than 0.05) with concomitant increases in VC, IC, and TLC (all p less than 0.05). Despite this, we found no differences in breathlessness intensity scores between patients and controls or in patients before and after successful antithyroid therapy.",

        "title": "Chest pain and breathlessness: relationship to psychiatric illness.",
        "content": "Chest pain and breathlessness are common somatic symptoms of emotional disorder in ambulatory care. Chronic chest pain has a prevalence of 12% and is associated with high utilization of health care. Of patients with chest pain and breathlessness who are referred to a cardiac clinic but subsequently shown not to have heart disease, the majority continue to report symptoms. Those patients with the worst outcome, in terms of continuing limitation of activity and use of medical resources, are those with chest pain but normal coronary arteries. A number of studies that fail to support a unitary theory of causation of noncardiac chest pain are described. A multifactorial, interactive model is proposed, with contributions from physical factors, such as palpitations and intercostal muscle pain; psychologic factors, which include enhanced awareness of and selective attention to bodily sensation; and environmental factors, such as previous exposure to cardiorespiratory disease in first-degree relatives or significant others. Although there have been few controlled intervention studies in patients with unexplained cardiorespiratory symptoms, there is evidence for the efficacy of both drug treatments and psychologic treatment. The results of intervention studies in patients with chest pain and normal coronary arteries are eagerly awaited. Atypical chest pain and breathlessness are common causes of office consultations and/or functional disability. The diagnoses should be established on the basis of positive evidence of psychiatric illness rather than by exclusion. The etiology is multifactorial, and management is aimed at treating the underlying psychosocial problems and/or psychiatric illness. Cognitive-behavioral treatments are probably as effective as drug treatments in the short-term, and the care of these patients would be improved by a more detailed explanation of noncardiac causes and a greater opportunity for patients to discuss their fears.",
