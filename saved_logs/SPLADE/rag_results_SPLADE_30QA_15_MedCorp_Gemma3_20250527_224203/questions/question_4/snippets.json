Thus, GH exerts some of its effects by binding to receptors on target cells, where it activates the MAPK/ERK pathway. Through this mechanism GH directly stimulates division and multiplication of chondrocytes of cartilage. GH also stimulates, through the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, the production of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1, formerly known as somatomedin C), a hormone homologous to proinsulin. The liver is a major target organ of GH for this process and is the principal site of IGF-1 production. IGF-1 has growth-stimulating effects on a wide variety of tissues. Additional IGF-1 is generated within target tissues, making it what appears to be both an endocrine and an autocrine/paracrine hormone.

        "content": "A series of studies examined the binding characteristics and ontogeny of hepatic growth hormone binding sites in dairy bulls on d 2, 30, 180, and 365 of age. Binding of iodinated recombinant bovine growth hormone ([125I]rbGH) to liver membrane receptors was membrane protein-dependent. Receptors were considered growth hormone-specific, because physiological concentrations of bovine prolactin (bPRL) failed to displace [125I]rbGH from bovine hepatocyte membranes. Only 50% of [125I]rbGH was bound reversibly to hepatic microsomes. Addition of dithiothreitol (DTT) to the receptor-assay buffer increased the binding of [125I]rbGH to hepatic membranes in a time-dependent manner. Moderate concentrations of Ca++ and Mg++ in the receptor-assay buffer had no detectable effects on binding of [125I]rbGH to hepatic microsomes. In growing dairy bulls, specific binding of [125I]rbGH per milligram of membrane protein increased from 1.9 +/- 1.8% at d 2 to 14.1 +/- 1.8% at d 180 and then declined to 5.2 +/- 1.6% at d 365. Likewise, concentration of insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I in serum was low during the 1st mo of age (d 2, 13.3 +/- 8.8 ng/ml; d 30, 9.7 +/- 8.8 ng/ml), but it became maximal at d 180 (151.0 +/- 8.8 ng/ml). Circulating concentrations of IGF-II increased linearly during the 1st yr of growth.

        "content": "Previous studies showed that both insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) stimulate metabolism and growth of preimplantation embryos. Because the effects of insulin occur with very low doses, it was suggested that its effects were mediated by its own receptors. However, the effects of IGF-1 occurred at higher doses, suggestive of cross reaction with the insulin receptor but still in the range for mediation via its own receptor. The aim of this study was to investigate the mediation of the metabolic and growth effects of insulin and IGF-1 using a specific insulin receptor antagonist. The antagonistic B-10 Fab fragment (B-10f) completely blocked stimulation of protein synthesis by both insulin and IGF-1, indicating that the insulin receptor mediates this action of both hormones. Alternately, only insulin's stimulation of inner cell mass mitogenesis and morphological development was inhibited by the B-10 Fab fragment. This showed that growth stimulation by insulin and IGF-1 was mediated via different receptors, insulin through its own receptor and IGF-1 through some other receptor. However, mediation via the IGF-2 receptor is not excluded since IGF-1 stimulates compaction when there is evidence for only the presence of the IGF-2 receptor. In summary, insulin or IGF-1 at physiological concentrations stimulates preimplantation mouse embryos, suggesting an important role for both these growth factors in early development.",

        "content": "Epidermal growth factor (EGF) has been shown to have a mitogenic effect on some breast cancer cells lines in vitro. The growth of the subclass of human breast tumors which expresses the specific receptor for EGF seems to be mediated by autocrine mechanisms rather than steroid hormones. The expression of EGF-receptor, as detected by an immunocytochemical method, was compared with the Growth Fraction (GF) by the Ki-67 monoclonal antibody and the S-phase content as tumor proliferative activity indexes, and with DNA ploidy and some pathologic features in 86 stage I-II breast carcinomas. Overall 52 out of 86 (60%) of the tumors were EGF-receptor positive. There was no correlation between the cell kinetics parameters and the EGF-receptor status, suggesting that its expression may be unrelated to the proliferative activity of the tumor in these clinical stages and that the EGF-receptor GF and S-phase may be independent variables in breast cancer. In our series 57% of tumors were DNA aneuploid and only a trend was found towards EGF-receptor positivity (P = 0.08). There was no correlation between EGF-receptor expression and grading or node-status. The overall picture is that of an independent relationship between EGF-receptor with the cell kinetics parameters and ploidy, confirming the complex and heterogeneous biology of breast carcinoma. These results suggest the possibility of better recognition of subsets of patients with diverse tumor aggressiveness, combining together EGF-receptor status, cell kinetics and ploidy, with a better stratification for treatment options.",
        "contents": "Relationship of the epidermal growth factor-receptor to the growth fraction (Ki-67 antibody) and the flow cytometric S-phase as cell kinetics parameters, in human mammary carcinomas. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) has been shown to have a mitogenic effect on some breast cancer cells lines in vitro. The growth of the subclass of human breast tumors which expresses the specific receptor for EGF seems to be mediated by autocrine mechanisms rather than steroid hormones. The expression of EGF-receptor, as detected by an immunocytochemical method, was compared with the Growth Fraction (GF) by the Ki-67 monoclonal antibody and the S-phase content as tumor proliferative activity indexes, and with DNA ploidy and some pathologic features in 86 stage I-II breast carcinomas. Overall 52 out of 86 (60%) of the tumors were EGF-receptor positive. There was no correlation between the cell kinetics parameters and the EGF-receptor status, suggesting that its expression may be unrelated to the proliferative activity of the tumor in these clinical stages and that the EGF-receptor GF and S-phase may be independent variables in breast cancer.

        "content": "The time-related changes in the plasma levels of growth hormone, insulin, somatomedin C and thyroxine following immunization against somatostatin, have been examined in sheep. In both the treated and control lambs there was a significant increase (P less than 0.01) in growth hormone levels with time from the start of the study (at three weeks of age) through until 13 weeks of age. This increase was mirrored by increasing somatomedin C (IGF-1) levels (P less than 0.001). Thyroxine levels did not change during the period of the study. Immunization against somatostatin did not produce any significant difference between treatment groups or between sexes in the levels of growth hormone or thyroxine. However, IGF-1 level were significantly increased (P less than 0.01) by the treatment in both sexes. The changes in the levels of insulin were complicated by a marked difference between the control groups; the control females being significantly different (P less than 0.001) from all the other animals.",
