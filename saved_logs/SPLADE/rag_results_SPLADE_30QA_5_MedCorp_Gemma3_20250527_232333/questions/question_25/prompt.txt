With your own knowledge and the help of the following document:

Document 1 (Title: Pathology_Robbins): Hydronephrosis refers to dilation of the renal pelvis and calyces, with accompanying atrophy of the parenchyma, caused by obstruction to the outflow of urine. The obstruction may be sudden or insidious, and it may occur at any level of the urinary tract, from the urethra to the renal pelvis. The most common causes are categorized as follows: Congenital, such as atresia of the urethra, valve formations in either the ureter or urethra, an aberrant renal artery compressing the ureter, renal ptosis with torsion, or kinking of the ureter Foreign bodies, such as calculi or sloughed necrotic papillae Proliferative lesions, such as benign prostatic hyperplasia, carcinoma of the prostate, bladder tumors (papilloma and carcinoma), contiguous malignant disease (retroperitoneal lymphoma, and carcinoma of the cervix or uterus) Inflammatory lesions, such as prostatitis, ureteritis, urethritis, and retroperitoneal fibrosis
Document 2 (Title: Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia -- Introduction): The development of BPH is characterized by stromal and epithelial cell proliferation in the prostate transition zone, which surrounds the urethra. This leads to urethral compression and bladder outflow obstruction, which can result in clinical manifestations of LUTS, urinary retention, or infections due to incomplete bladder emptying. [5] Long-term, untreated disease can lead to the development of chronic high-pressure retention (a potentially life-threatening condition) and long-term or permanent changes to the bladder detrusor muscle.
Document 3 (Title: [Benign prostatic hyperplasia as a frequent senile disease of the male].): An adenofibromyomatous proliferation starting from the region of the periurethral glands is referred to as benign prostatic hyperplasia. It is the result of a senile endocrinopathy, which leads to a disbalance of the peripheral hormonal milieu, and of an intraglandular disturbance of the utilization of the hormone. It becomes a disease when it is followed by an increase of the vesical outlet resistance and thus by an obstructive disturbance of the voiding of the urinary bladder. The indication for operation is determined by the degree of the obstruction and its pathophysiological sequelae as well as the complaints of the patients. The conservative therapy is above all symptomatic and indicated only at the initial stage of the disease. The transurethral resection is the operative therapy of choice. In very large hyperplasias the open surgical intervention may be necessary. In inoperable patients a urethral catheter should be renounced for a suprapubic puncture cystostomy. Also after operative ectomy of a benign prostatic hyperplasia the patients may fall ill with a carcinoma of the prostatic gland. Therefore, the duty for undergoing an annual preventive medical examination remains.
Document 4 (Title: Hydronephrosis): The most common causes of hydronephrosis in children are anatomical abnormalities. These include vesicoureteral reflux, urethral stricture, and stenosis. The most common cause of hydronephrosis in young adults is kidney stones. In older adults, the most common cause of hydronephrosis is benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH), or intrapelvic neoplasms such as prostate cancer. Compression of one or both ureters can also be caused by other developmental defects not completely occurring during the fetal stage such as an abnormally placed vein, artery, or tumor. Bilateral compression of the ureters can occur during pregnancy due to enlargement of the uterus. Changes in hormone levels during this time may also affect the muscle contractions of the bladder, further complicating this condition. Sources of obstruction that can arise from other various causes include kidney stones, blood clots or retroperitoneal fibrosis.
Document 5 (Title: Chronic kidney disease): By anatomical location Vascular disease includes large vessel disease such as bilateral kidney artery stenosis and small vessel disease such as ischemic nephropathy, hemolytic-uremic syndrome, and vasculitis. Glomerular disease comprises a diverse group and is classified into: Primary glomerular disease such as focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and IgA nephropathy (or nephritis) Secondary glomerular disease such as diabetic nephropathy and lupus nephritis Tubulointerstitial disease includes drug- and toxin-induced chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis, and reflux nephropathy. Obstructive nephropathy, as exemplified by bilateral kidney stones and benign prostatic hyperplasia of the prostate gland. Rarely, pinworms infecting the kidney can cause obstructive nephropathy.
