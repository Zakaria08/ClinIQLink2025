Document 1 (Title: Prostate Cancer -- Medical Oncology -- Aggressive Prostate Cancer): Aggressive disease in prostate cancer is typically defined as either locally advanced, a higher Gleason score (Gleason 4+4=8 or higher), or a rapid PSA doubling time of 10 months or less. Treatment for aggressive prostate cancers may involve radical prostatectomy, radiation therapy, HIFU, cryosurgery, hormonal therapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, radiopharmaceuticals, or some combination of these. Early use of combinatorial therapies is helpful in many patients presenting with aggressive or advanced, localized disease. [26] [296] [321]
Document 2 (Title: Treatment of localized prostatic cancer.): Discovery of a localized prostatic cancer frequently creates a therapeutic dilemma. A significant number of patients do well for an extended period of time without treatment, while others suffer rapid tumor progression and death from prostatic cancer. Without treatment nearly one third of patients with stage B prostatic cancer can be expected to develop distant metastatic disease or death from prostatic cancer within 10 years. In patients who otherwise have a reasonable life expectancy of 10 years or more, aggressive therapy is justified. Long-term disease-free survival has been reported after both radical prostatectomy and external irradiation. The fact that nearly 50% of patients treated with external irradiation for stage B prostatic cancer have positive postirradiation biopsies is of concern, but the impact of this finding on overall survival is yet to be determined. The only randomized prospective study comparing radical prostatectomy with external irradiation showed a statistically significant decrease in the time to Nevertheless, as evidenced by the National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Panel, further randomized prospective trials are needed to determine the relative value of radical prostatectomy versus external irradiation for localized prostatic cancer. For the forseeable future, definitive scientific data on which to base treatment recommendations will not be available. Therefore, patients should be well informed of the various treatment options available, and the wishes of the patient are paramount. The clinician's roles are to interpret the data, present it in a meaningful manner to patients, be guided in discussions by patient preferences, and make recommendations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

The usefulness of 5-ARIs for the potential treatment of acne is uncertain. 5-ARIs are sometimes used as antiandrogens in feminizing hormone therapy for transgender women to help reduce body hair growth and scalp hair loss. They have also been explored in the treatment and prevention of prostate cancer. While the 5-ARI finasteride reduces the cancer risk by about a third, it also increases the fraction of aggressive forms of prostate cancer. Overall, there does not seem to be a survival benefit for prostate cancer patients under finasteride.
Document 4 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): boney structures. Modern CT PET scans have a limited role at this point.Treatment for localized prostate cancer is guided by can-cer aggressiveness and patient’s preferences. Active sur-veillance is recommended for patients with low-risk disease grade 1–2, early-stage disease (cT1c), and small volume disease as determined by biopsy. Large prospective cohorts and randomized clinical trials have established the safety of this approach.134,135 The risk of progression to metastatic disease with close follow-up and repeat prostate biopsies is less than 2% in over 12 years. Radical prostatectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection (robotic, laparoscopic, or open), image modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), and brachytherapy are the standard of care for curative treatments. All provide equal cancer specific survival for low and intermediate risk cancers. For higher risk prostate cancer patients, both surgery and IMRT with androgen 8Figure 40-11.

Document 5 (Title: Pathology_Robbins): The relatively low rate of mortality in men with prostate cancer is related in part to increased detection of the disease through screening (discussed later), but how effective screening is at saving lives is controversial. This seeming paradox is related to the wide variation in the natural history of prostate cancer, from aggressive and rapidly fatal to indolent disease of no clinical significance. Indeed, prostate carcinoma commonly is found incidentally at autopsy in men dying of other causes, and many more men die with prostate cancer than of prostate cancer. It is not currently possible to identify the tumors that will be “bad actors” with certainty; thus, while some men are no doubt saved by early detection and treatment of their prostate cancers, it is equally certain that others are being “cured” of clinically inconsequential tumors.
