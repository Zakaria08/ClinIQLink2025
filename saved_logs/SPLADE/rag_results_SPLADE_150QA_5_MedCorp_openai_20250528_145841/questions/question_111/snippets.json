        "title": "Activation of a phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C by colony stimulating factor 1 receptor requires tyrosine phosphorylation and a guanine nucleotide-binding protein.",
        "content": "Receptor tyrosine kinases couple to multiple intracellular effector molecules that are crucial for normal cell growth and transformation. Stimulation of membrane phospholipid hydrolysis by receptor tyrosine kinases is one such pathway for generating intracellular second messengers that may be important for mitogenesis. Certain receptor tyrosine kinases tyrosine phosphorylate a phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C that hydrolyses the membrane phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. In contrast, the glycoprotein receptor for colony stimulating factor 1, a transmembrane tyrosine kinase, does not utilize this pathway, but rather stimulates the hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine. Here we show that eluates of antiphosphotyrosine affinity purified lysates of colony-stimulating factor 1-stimulated cells contain elevated levels of phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C activity. The affinity-purified activity is sensitive to tyrosine-specific T-cell phosphatase, and is detected in the membrane fraction of stimulated cells. Recovery of phospholipase C activity in the antiphosphotyrosine protein fraction is reduced by pertussis toxin pretreatment of cells. The phosphatidylcholine phospholipase C activity in isolated membranes of colony-stimulating factor 1-treated cells was also reduced by pertussis toxin treatment and stimulated by guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate. These results indicate that colony stimulating factor 1 receptor-mediated stimulation of phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C requires tyrosine phosphorylation, and might be affected by a G-protein coupled pathway.",

        "title": "Calcium signaling",
        "content": "Phospholipase C Pathway Specific signals can trigger a sudden increase in the cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels to 500\u20131,000 nM by opening channels in the ER or the plasma membrane. The most common signaling pathway that increases cytoplasmic calcium concentration is the phospholipase C (PLC) pathway. Many cell surface receptors, including G protein-coupled receptors and receptor tyrosine kinases, activate the PLC enzyme. PLC uses hydrolysis of the membrane phospholipid PIP2 to form IP3 and diacylglycerol (DAG), two classic secondary messengers. DAG attaches to the plasma membrane and recruits protein kinase C (PKC). IP3 diffuses to the ER and is bound to the IP3 receptor. The IP3 receptor serves as a Ca2+ channel, and releases Ca2+ from the ER. The Ca2+ bind to PKC and other proteins and activate them.",

        "content": "Opioid Receptors are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). They mediate the human body's response to most hormones, neurotransmitters, drugs, and are involved in sensory perception of vision, taste, and olfaction. [2] All GPCRs consists of seven transmembrane spanning proteins that couple to intracellular G proteins. There are different types of G proteins bound to receptors which are differentiated based on the signaling pathways activated intracellularly. Gs protein-coupled receptors are considered stimulatory due to their activation of the molecule adenylate cyclase, which increases cAMP production. The molecule cAMP activates Protein Kinase A (PKA) that is responsible for phosphorylation of numerous proteins, ion channels, and enzymes ultimately resulting in their activation/inhibition.

Pore loops form the internal wall of the glutamate channel, whereas transmembrane domain 2 forms the internal wall of cys-loop receptors. (A and B, From Purves D, Augustine GJ, Fitzpatrick D.

        "title": "Physiology, Cholinergic Receptors -- Mechanism",
        "content": "While both nicotinic and muscarinic receptors become activated in response to the ligand-binding of acetylcholine, their mechanism of activation differs significantly. As mentioned, nicotinic receptors are ionotropic; this means activation of the receptor leads to the formation of an ion channel within the cell membrane, known as a ligand-gated ion channel. [10] The channel consists of five homologous subunits that form a central pore in the membrane\u00a0upon activation, which cations may pass through. [10] Depending on the strength of signals, the influx of cations into the cell can cause depolarization, generating an excitatory action potential. This activity differs from the activation of muscarinic receptors, which are G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCRs constitute a family of receptors that generate a second messenger system when activated via ligand binding. A second messenger system utilizes the activation of intracellular signaling molecules to produce the excitatory or inhibitory response. Muscarinic receptors generate separate second messenger systems. The M1 and M3 receptors are characterized as\u00a0excitatory GPCRs known as Gq GPCRs. [13] Upon their activation, they generate phospholipase C, producing the second messenger's inositol triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG) and leading to an increase in intracellular calcium and protein kinase.
