        "content": "To examine the impact of changing practice with regard to infant sleeping position on mortality from the sudden infant death syndrome. A population based study of all infants dying suddenly and unexpectedly during February 1990 to July 1991, and two groups of controls; one comprising every 125th baby born to Avon residents and the other comprising pairs of infants matched to each index case for age, neighbourhood, and date of study. Information about sleeping position was collected at home visits soon after the index baby's death or, for the population based controls, on several occasions in the first six months of life. The design was comparable to that of an earlier study of the same population. County of Avon. 35 infants who died suddenly and unexpectedly (32 of the sudden infant death syndrome), 70 matched controls, and 152 population based controls. The prevalence of prone sleeping in the matched controls was much lower than that found in an earlier study in Avon (28% (18/64) 1990-1 v 58% (76/131) 1987-9; p less than 0.001) and was comparable with the prevalence in population based controls (29%). This would be expected to lead to a reduction in the incidence of the sudden infant death syndrome to 2.0/1000 live births (95% confidence interval 1.8/1000 to 2.5/1000). The actual mortality fell from 3.5/1000 in 1987-9 to 1.7/1000. The fall in mortality can be almost entirely accounted for by the reduction in prone sleeping, suggesting a causal relation exists between them. Side and supine positions confer protection but the side position is unstable and the infant may roll prone. We therefore recommend supine as the safest sleeping position for babies.",

        "content": "In 1992, the first National Infant Sleep Position (NISP) Household Survey was conducted to determine the usual position in which U.S. mothers placed their babies to sleep: lateral (side), prone (stomach), supine (back), other, or no usual position. According to the 1992 NISP survey, 13.0% of U.S. infants were positioned in the supine position for sleep. According to the 2006 NISP survey 75.7% of infants were positioned in the supine position to sleep. According the CDC, the four tips for parents and caregivers to help a baby sleep safety are as follows: 1.)Place your baby on his or her back for all sleep times-naps and at night. 2.)Use a firm sleep surface, such as a mattress in a safety-approved crib. 3.) Keep soft bedding such as blankets, pillows, bumper pads, and soft toys out of baby\u2019s sleep area. 4.) have baby share your room, not your bed.
