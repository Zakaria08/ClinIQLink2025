Document 1 (Title: EMS Tactical Care and Evacuation Under Fire -- Issues of Concern -- Care): The WARM ZONE (Tactical Field Care) is the area in which there is still potential for danger, but the threat is not immediate. It may be referred to as the Yellow Zone or Tactical Field Care. In this zone, the TEMS provider must weigh the risks of evacuation with delayed medical intervention versus remaining in an area where danger still exists to provide immediate care. The COOL ZONE is the area where no imminent danger exists. It may also be referred to as the Green Zone or Tac-Evac.
Document 2 (Title: Fournier gangrene): Fournier gangrene is a recognized side effect of SGLT2 inhibitors (canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and empagliflozin), which increase the excretion of glucose in the urine. Diagnosis Fournier gangrene is usually diagnosed clinically, but laboratory tests and imaging studies are used to confirm diagnosis, determine severity, and predict outcomes. X-rays and ultrasounds may show the presence of gas below the surface of the skin. A CT scan can be useful in determining the site of origin and extent of spread.
Document 3 (Title: [Evolution and treatment of 8 patients with Fournier's perineal-scrotal gangrene].): The authors present eight cases of Fournier's gangrene treated from 1987 to 1989 (3 years). There was no discernable cause for 5 patients (62.5%). Immediate aggressive surgical debridement of all necrotic tissue was performed. Intravenous antibiotics and resuscitation fluid and hyperbaric oxygenation were also administered to all patients. Skin grafting was performed for 4 patients (40%), 3 weeks after surgical debridement. One patient died (12.5%) and 2 subsequently developed an urethral stricture. Etiology, treatment and outcome of Fournier's gangrene are discussed and the results of the study are compared to other studies. This disease is still serious, its pathogenesis is not completely elucidated, but when immediate adequate treatment is performed, the outcome is generally favourable.
Document 4 (Title: Cell_Biology_Alberts): As we have emphasized, the genetic instability of cancer cells makes the cells both dangerous and vulnerable—dangerous because of the enhancement in their ability to evolve and proliferate, and vulnerable because treatment that leads to still more extreme genetic disruption can take them over the brink and kill them. In some cancers, genetic instability results from an identified fault in one of the many devices on which normal cells depend for DNA repair and maintenance. In this case, a drug is tailored to block a complementary part of the DNA repair machinery can lead to such severe genetic damage that the cancer cells die.
Document 5 (Title: Psichiatry_DSM-5): Genetic and physiological. Behavioral disinhibition is a highly heritable general propensity to not constrain behavior in socially acceptable ways, to break social norms and rules, and to take dangerous risks, pursuing rewards excessively despite dangers of adverse consequences. Youths with strong behavioral disinhibition show risk factors for inhalant use disorder: early- onset substance use disorder, multiple substance involvement, and early conduct problems. Because behavioral disinhibition is under strong genetic inﬂuence, youths in families with substance and antisocial problems are at elevated risk for inhalant use disorder. Certain native or aboriginal communities have experienced a high prevalence of inhalant problems. Also, in some countries, groups of homeless children in street gangs have ex- tensive inhalant use problems. Although the prevalence of inhalant use disorder is almost identical in adolescent males and females, the disorder is very rare among adult females.
