        "content": "A 42-year-old primigravida\u00a0woman\u00a0at 34 weeks gestation was brought to the obstetric emergency department at midnight with complaints of severe headache, blurry vision, and right upper quadrant pain for the last\u00a05 to\u00a06 hours. She noted lower extremity edema and facial swelling that was gradually increasing. She has gestational hypertension and, 1 week ago, was prescribed labetalol 200 mg twice a day. On initial presentation, her blood pressure was 190/110 mm Hg on\u00a02 separate occasions, 5 minutes apart. She had gained\u00a02 kilograms since her last antenatal checkup in the clinic\u00a0a week ago. The patient was diagnosed with severe preeclampsia. The senior obstetric resident ordered\u00a0a loading dose of magnesium sulfate to prevent imminent seizure. The hospital protocol used an intravenous (IV) and intramuscular (IM) regimen where the patient received a 4 g IV bolus and a 10 g IM dose administered as 5 g in each buttock. The senior resident gave verbal orders for magnesium sulfate administration to the junior resident, who verbally communicated the order to the nurse.",

        "content": "Central nervous system is rarely involved in progressive systemic sclerosis (PSS) unless there are concomitant abnormalities in renal or lung function or hypertension. A 72-year-old woman with typical PSS developed cerebellar bleeding. Medical history records revealed, she had noted the onset of Raynaud's sign on her upper extremities at the age of 37. This was followed by necrosis and repeated infection, and as a result, shortening of her fingers in her 40's. The disease progressed and involved lower extremities, and then face and body in her 50's. Aortic valve stenosis was diagnosed at 69 year old, cardiac myopathy at 70 and at the age of 71 infectious dermatitis in both inguinal regions. Mild anemia, hypoalbuminemia and the decrease of serum Fe were discovered in June 1988. At the same time, prolonged ESR, positive C-reactive protein, RA, and anti-nuclear-antibody were also noticed. A chest roentgenogram revealed pulmonary fibrosis. Systemic hypertension was not noticed on the clinical course. She developed an onset of vertigo and vomiting in the morning of August 8, 1988. Consequently, she was brought to our hospital. She was alert but a physical examination showed a swallowing disturbance, dysarthria, right cerebellar ataxia, nystagmus and hypertension (192/100 mmHg). A CT examination on admission revealed a slightly low density area in right cerebellar hemisphere without mass effect. She was treated with dextran and mannitol and her condition improved on the 6th day of her admission. She was alert and blood pressure calm down to 120/70 mmHg without the use of anti-hypertension drugs on August 21.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Her labor is equally difficult, with Carol collapsing on the staircase of the El train and then suffering from dangerous bleeding during delivery. Despite the problems, Carol delivers Tess and Kate Ross on Thanksgiving Day assisted by then-OB nurse Abby Lockhart with long-time friend and colleague Dr. Mark Greene as her birthing coach. When Doug learns of his twin daughters' birth via a telephone call, he again invites them to come and live with him in Seattle. Carol cannot decide if it is the right thing to do; she is still hurt over his abrupt departure a year earlier. She attempts to raise their daughters alone. After the birth of the twins, Carol struggles to balance child-rearing, her postpartum emotions, and her return to work. She also tells Mark that she knows the girls deserve a father. Mark then says that Doug has been seeing them, implying plane visits off-screen.",
