        "content": "The HLA class II region is also illustrated in Fig. 373e-1. Multiple class II genes are arrayed within the centromeric 1 Mb of the HLA region, forming distinct haplotypes. A haplotype refers to an array of alleles at polymorphic loci along a chromosomal segment. Multiple class II genes are present on a single haplotype, clustered into three major subregions: HLA-DR, -DQ, and -DP. Each of these subregions contains at least one functional alpha (A) locus and one functional beta (B) locus. Together these encode proteins that form the \u03b1 and \u03b2 polypeptide chains of a mature class II HLA molecule. Thus, the DRA and DRB genes encode an HLA-DR molecule; DQA and DQB genes encode HLA-DQ molecules; and DPA and DPB genes encode HLA-DP molecules. There are several DRB genes (DRB1, DRB2, DRB3, etc.), so that two expressed DR molecules are encoded on most haplotypes by combining the \u03b1-chain product of the DRA gene with separate \u03b2 chains. More than 1000 alleles have been identified at the HLA-DRB1",

        "content": "Human cluster-of-differentiation 1 (CD1) is a family of cell surface glycoproteins of unknown function expressed on immature thymocytes, epidermal Langerhans cells and a subset of B lymphocytes. Three homologous proteins, CD1a, b and c, have been defined serologically, and the CD1 gene locus on human chromosome 1 contains five potential CD1 genes. Analysis of the predicted amino-acid sequences of CD1 molecules reveals a low but significant level of homology to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and class II molecules, and, like MHC class I molecules, CD1 molecules are associated non-covalently with beta 2-microglobulin. These structural similarities to known antigen-presenting molecules, together with the expression of CD1 on cells capable of antigen presentation, suggest a role for CD1 molecules in antigen recognition by T cells. Here we demonstrate the specific recognition of CD1a by a CD4-CD8- alpha beta T-cell receptor (TCR) expressing cytolytic T lymphocyte (CTL) line and the specific recognition of CD1c by a CD4-CD8- gamma delta TCR CTL line. The interaction of CD1-specific CTLs with CD1+ target cells appeared to involve the CD3-TCR complex, and did not show evidence of MHC restriction. These results suggest that for a subset of T cells, CD1 molecules serve a function analogous to that of MHC class I and II molecules.",

This class II molecule is a heterodimer consisting of an alpha (DPA) and a beta chain (DPB), both anchored in the membrane. It plays a central role in the immune system by presenting peptides derived from extracellular proteins. Class II molecules are expressed in antigen presenting cells (APC: B lymphocytes, dendritic cells, macrophages). The beta chain is approximately 26-28 kDa and its gene contains 6 exons. Exon one encodes the leader peptide, exons 2 and 3 encode the two extracellular domains, exon 4 encodes the transmembrane domain and exon 5 encodes the cytoplasmic tail. Within the DP molecule both the alpha chain and the beta chain contain the polymorphisms specifying the peptide binding specificities, resulting in up to 4 different molecules.",

        "content": "Clearly, the human genome includes a group of genes closely related to but distinct from the HLA class I genes encoding the HLA-A, -B, and -C major transplantation antigens. These non-A,B,C class I genes, designated as HLA-E, HLA-F, and HLA-G, are on the short arm of chromosome 6 and part of the HLA class I gene family. Although the human HLA-E, -F, and -G genes have features in common with the murine Qa- and Tla-genes, e.g. little allelic polymorphism, their relationship to the murine Qa- and Tla-region genes remains unclear. It has been suggested that the nonclassical MHC class I molecules function as ligands for gamma-delta T lymphocytes. The speculation is supported by the recent reports of a murine Qa-1 restricted gamma-delta T cell hybridoma and recognition of a TL antigen by gamma delta T cell receptors. The amino acid sequences of the HLA-E, -F, and -G encoded proteins suggest that each protein is likely to fold three-dimensionally into a structure very similar to HLA-A2 and has a capability of presenting a bound peptide at the cell surface. In light of the possible role of bound peptide in the expression of a class I molecule at the cell surface, it is interesting to note that the HLA-E and HLA-F molecules, even in association with beta 2-microglobulin, could not be detected at the cell surface of a transfected B-LCL. In contrast, the HLA-G molecule was found at the surface of transfected B-LCLs. Both HLA-E and HLA-F are less similar in sequence to HLA-A,B,C than is HLA-G. One explanation would be that the HLA-E and -F molecules have a mutation such that they are no longer able to bind peptide. If the HLA-G molecule does function to present peptide to T lymphocytes, there are features unique to HLA-G that should impact on its ability to perform this function. Both the analysis of HLA-G RNA and protein in trophoblasts indicate that HLA-G, unlike HLA-A, -B, -C, is relatively nonpolymorphic. Since HLA-A,B,C polymorphism is thought to increase the number of different peptides that these molecules can bind, HLA-G is likely to be able to bind a relatively limited variety of peptides. HLA-G also differs from HLA-A, -B, and -C in that it seems to only be expressed by placental amniochorionic trophoblasts.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",
