Document 1 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Humans are the only reservoir of T. b. gambiense, which occurs in widely distributed foci in tropical rain forests of Central and West Africa. Gambiense trypanosomiasis is primarily a problem in rural populations; tourists rarely become infected. Trypanotolerant antelope species in savanna and woodland areas of Central and East Africa are the principal reservoir of T. b. rhodesiense. Cattle can also be infected with this and other trypanosome species but generally succumb to the infection. Because risk results from contact with tsetse flies that feed on wild animals, humans acquire T. b. rhodesiense infection only inciden-1397 tally, usually while visiting or working in areas where infected game and vectors are present. Roughly one or two imported cases of HAT acquired in East African parks are reported to the CDC each year.
Document 2 (Title: Onchocerciasis distribution and severity in five West African countries.): The Onchocerciasis Control Programme in West Africa recently extended its operation to Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, the western part of Mali, Senegal and Sierra Leone. To estimate the number of people infected and blinded by the disease and to determine its distribution and severity in the extension area, 215 villages were selected, using a stratified random sampling procedure, and surveyed. All the relevant entomological information available at the time was used in the sampling procedure and in the selection of 92 non-representative villages that were surveyed to confirm the findings. In addition, the populations of 608 villages were examined to map out in detail the distribution of onchocerciasis in the areas at a high risk of onchocercal blindness. The study estimated that 1,475,367 people were infected and 23,728 were blinded from onchocerciasis out of a rural population of 4,464,183. The northern and western part of the study area and the lower Niger basin presented a low or no risk of onchocercal blindness. The upper Niger basin, the south-central part of Sierra Leone, and three small foci in the Gambia, Bakoye, and lower Niger river basins were areas with a high risk of onchocercal blindness. The other parts of the study area presented a medium risk of onchocercal blindness. By detecting the communities at risk of onchocercal disease this study permits the selection of populations for disease control based on mass distribution of ivermectin, a microfilaricide.
Document 3 (Title: Heart rate): Other studies have shown that a high resting heart rate is associated with an increase in cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in the general population and in patients with chronic diseases. A faster resting heart rate is associated with shorter life expectancy and is considered a strong risk factor for heart disease and heart failure, independent of level of physical fitness. Specifically, a resting heart rate above 65 beats per minute has been shown to have a strong independent effect on premature mortality; every 10 beats per minute increase in resting heart rate has been shown to be associated with a 10–20% increase in risk of death. In one study, men with no evidence of heart disease and a resting heart rate of more than 90 beats per minute had a five times higher risk of sudden cardiac death. Similarly, another study found that men with resting heart rates of over 90 beats per minute had an almost two-fold increase in risk for cardiovascular disease mortality; in women it
Document 4 (Title: Human African Trypanosomiasis (Sleeping Sickness) -- Introduction): Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), or African sleeping sickness, is a potentially life-threatening infectious illness caused by the protozoans Trypanosoma brucei gambiense ( T brucei gambiense ) or Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense ( T brucei  rhodesiense) transmitted by the tsetse fly (see Image . Vector and Organism of Human African Trypanosomiasis). [1] This disease is endemic in sub-Saharan Africa but can be seen outside of endemic areas among travelers. These parasites produce illnesses with different clinical and epidemiological characteristics. East African HAT is caused by T brucei rhodesiense . West African HAT is caused by T brucei gambiense. Both conditions have hemolymphatic and meningoencephalitic stages. [2] HAT is considered a neglected tropical disease and is a significant public health threat in rural Africa. [3]
Document 5 (Title: Heart rate): Correlation with cardiovascular mortality risk A number of investigations indicate that faster resting heart rate has emerged as a new risk factor for mortality in homeothermic mammals, particularly cardiovascular mortality in human beings. Faster heart rate may accompany increased production of inflammation molecules and increased production of reactive oxygen species in cardiovascular system, in addition to increased mechanical stress to the heart. There is a correlation between increased resting rate and cardiovascular risk. This is not seen to be "using an allotment of heart beats" but rather an increased risk to the system from the increased rate.
