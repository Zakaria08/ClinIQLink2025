Document 3 (Title: Uses of hyperbaric oxygen therapy in the 1990s.): Hyperbaric oxygen can produce a variety of effects in addition to reducing air and gas embolism. It increases the killing ability of leukocytes and is lethal to certain anaerobic bacteria. It inhibits toxin formation by certain anaerobes, increases the flexibility of red cells, reduces tissue edema, preserves intracellular adenosine triphosphate, maintains tissue oxygenation in the absence of hemoglobin. In addition, it stimulates fibroblast growth, increases collagen formation, promotes more rapid growth of capillaries, and terminates lipid peroxidation. These actions of hyperbaric oxygen are useful in treating anaerobic infections that result in gas gangrene, as well as severe aerobic infections such as necrotizing fasciitis, malignant external otitis, and chronic refractory osteomyelitis. Hyperbaric oxygen can help preserve ischemic tissues and facilitates the rapid spread and arborization of new capillaries. It promotes healing in certain problem wounds. Adjunctive hyperbaric oxygen treatment is a new approach to the management of radionecrosis. Hyperbaric oxygen treatment reduces morbidity and mortality resulting from carbon monoxide poisoning. Protocols for hyperbaric oxygen therapy are at present mostly empirical; much additional research is needed to better define therapeutic indications.
Document 4 (Title: [Hyperbaric oxygenation in the treatment of necrotizing fasciitis].): The authors present the results of treatment provided to 11 patients with necrotizing fasciitis who were after a surgical operation and after administration of antibiotics treated in a hyperbaric chamber. A total of 8 patients (82%) recovered completely. The authors discuss the theory of action of hyperbaric oxygen on microorganisms and draw attention to the possible reduction of mortality of this serious disease when using hyperbaric oxygenation. The latter is considered an important auxiliary method which supplements surgical treatment, rational antibiotic therapy and in particular careful intensive care.
Document 5 (Title: Gynecology_Novak): on a daily basis as necessary until healthy tissue is displayed at all margins. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy may be of some benefit, particularly in patients for whom culture results are positive for anaerobic organisms (110). Retrospective nonrandomized studies demonstrated that the addition of hyperbaric oxygen therapy to surgical debridement and antimicrobial therapy appears to significantly decrease both wound morbidity and overall mortality in patients with necrotizing fasciitis (110). The benefit of hyperbaric therapy demonstrated in one study was remarkable, given that patients receiving hyperbaric oxygen were sicker and had a higher incidence of diabetes mellitus, leukocytosis, and shock (106).
