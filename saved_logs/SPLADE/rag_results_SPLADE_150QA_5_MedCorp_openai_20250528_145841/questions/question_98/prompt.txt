Document 1 (Title: Clinical trial): Informed consent is a legal process in which a recruit is instructed about key facts before deciding whether to participate. Researchers explain the details of the study in terms the subject can understand. The information is presented in the subject's native language. Generally, children cannot autonomously provide informed consent, but depending on their age and other factors, may be required to provide informed assent. Statistical power In any clinical trial, the number of subjects, also called the sample size, has a large impact on the ability to reliably detect and measure the effects of the intervention. This ability is described as its "power", which must be calculated before initiating a study to figure out if the study is worth its costs. In general, a larger sample size increases the statistical power, also the cost.
Document 2 (Title: Recruiting family physicians as participants in research.): Obtaining the voluntary participation of family physicians in quality of care research is a major problem in family practice research. An innovative approach was therefore required to recruit 120 randomly selected family physicians in southern Ontario in a quality of care study by the College of Family Physicians of Canada. A network of physician recruiters oriented to the study was organized for each district. This recruitment method resulted in an 84.5% participation rate. The relationship of these physician recruiters to the candidate and the method of approach were important factors in the enrolment process: the highest participation rate (95%) was obtained when the recruiters were friends of the candidate and when a personal meeting was arranged (91%). Recruiters were given an information package to help them in the recruitment process and rated the most useful items as follows: a policy statement about confidentiality, a description of the study and reprints of a published feasibility study. These results illustrate that cooperation in research in family physicians' offices can become a reality.
Document 3 (Title: Debriefing the Interprofessional Team in Medical Simulation -- Issues of Concern): Organizational-, participant-, and debriefer-specific barriers can adversely influence inter-professional team SBT debriefings.  At the organizational level, both a lack of institutional support for SBT and the absence of an appropriate learning structure for it can undermine SBT activities. Manifestations may include off-limit topics of discussion or the absence of a safe learning environment. Identifying and recruiting a champion within the leadership group can address these difficult issues. Participant-specific barriers can arise due to learner-specific characteristics or situation-specific issues that lead to difficulties with participants during the debriefing process. Learner-specific examples include the shy participant, the indifferent participant, the dominating participant with poor insight, and the dominating participant showing off.  Situation-specific examples include participants who react emotionally or defensively because of the scenario. [19] Strategies to address participant-specific barriers include both non-verbal and verbal communicative techniques.  Important non-verbal methods involve remaining silent to invite participant input, establishing eye contact, and using body language to project an inviting attitude.  Communicative strategies include a variety of techniques such as normalization, validation, generalization, paraphrasing, broadening, previewing, and naming the dynamic.

Document 4 (Title: Cell_Biology_Alberts): 1–9 Genes participating in informational processes such as replication, transcription, and translation are transferred between species much less often than are genes involved in metabolism. The basis for this inequality is unclear at present, but one suggestion is that it relates to the underlying complexity of the two types of processes. Informational processes tend to involve large aggregates of different gene products, whereas metabolic reactions are usually catalyzed by enzymes composed of a single protein. Why would the complexity of the underlying process—informational or metabolic—have any effect on the rate of horizontal gene transfer?
Document 5 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): surgeon judges necessary to preserve life and restore health.4 This justification is based on the social consensus that most people would want their lives and health protected in this way, and this consensus is manifest in the medical profession’s gen-eral orientation to preserve life. It may be that subsequent care may be withdrawn or withheld when the clinical prognosis is clearer, but in the context of initial resuscitation of injured patients, incomplete information makes clear judgments about the patient’s ultimate prognosis or outcome impossible.The pediatric population also presents unique challenges for the process of consent. For many reasons, children and ado-lescents cannot participate in the process of giving informed 1122Brunicardi_Ch48_p2061-p2076.indd 206319/02/19 1:49 PM 2064SPECIFIC CONSIDERATIONSPART IIconsent in the same way as adults. Depending on their age, children may lack the cognitive and emotional maturity to participate fully in the process. In addition,
