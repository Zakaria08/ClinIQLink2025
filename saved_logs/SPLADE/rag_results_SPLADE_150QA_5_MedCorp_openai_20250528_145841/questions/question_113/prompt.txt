With your own knowledge and the help of the following document:

Document 1 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): An anopheline mosquito inoculates plasmodium sporozoites to initiate human infection (Figure 52–1). Circulating sporozoites rapidly invade liver cells, and exoerythrocytic stage tissue schizonts mature in the liver. Merozoites are subsequently released from the liver and invade erythrocytes. Only erythrocytic parasites cause clinical illness. Repeated cycles of infection can lead to the infection of many erythrocytes and serious disease. Sexual stage gametocytes also develop in erythrocytes before being taken up by mosquitoes, where they develop into infective sporozoites.
Document 2 (Title: A malarial parasite of Australian skinks, Plasmodium mackerrasae sp. n.): Plasmodium mackerrasae sp. n. parasitizes the Australian lizards Egernia cunninghami and E. striolata (Sauria: Scincidae). Described from an experimental host, E. whitei, it produces mature schizonts containing 6--12 nuclei arranged peripherally as a rosette, and round to oval gametocytes which are equal to or slightly smaller than host cell nuclei. Both schizonts and gametocytes parasitize all cells in the erythrocyte series. Presence of pigment in both asexual and sexual stages is correlated with maturity of the host cell. Asexual forms contain a single large vacuole, whereas mature gametocytes may show 1--4 vacuoles. Plasmodium mackerrasae resembles most closely P. sasai of Japan and P. tropiduri of tropical America. It differs from P. sasai by lacking fan-shaped schizonts and by having less heavily pigmented gametocytes, and from P. tropiduri by less variability in shape and greater vacuolation of the gametocytes. Host and geographic differences further support its distinction.
Document 3 (Title: Plasmodium falciparum Malaria -- Etiology): Five species of genus Plasmodium are known to cause malaria in humans. The vector for Plasmodium spp. is a female A nopheles mosquito that inoculates sporozoites contained in her salivary glands into the puncture wound when feeding. [3] Sporozoites enter peripheral bloodstream and are uptaken by hepatocytes, where they undergo an asexual pre-erythrocytic liver-stage as liver schizonts lasting up to 2 weeks before the onset of the blood stage. [3] [4] As they replicate within hepatocytes, they form motile merozoites that are subsequently released into the bloodstream, where they invade red blood cells (RBC). The process continues through serial cycles of asexual replication of merozoites that go through ring, trophozoite, and schizont stages before forming and releasing new invasive daughter merozoites that consequently infect new RBC, therefore causing a rise in parasite numbers. [3] [5] P. falciparum produces high levels of blood-stage parasites and is known to modify the surface of the infected RBC, creating an adhesive phenotype, e.g. (sticky cell) causing RBC sequestration inside small and middle-sized vessels, removing the parasite from the circulation for nearly half of the asexual cycle. [6] Sequestration leads to splenic parasite clearance avoidance, host cell endothelial damage, and microvascular obstruction. [5] [6] A small fraction of intra-erythrocytic parasites switch to sexual development, producing morphologically distinct male and female gametocytes that reach the host's dermis and are ingested by a mosquito, rendering it infectious to humans. [3] [4] [5] After ingestion by a female A nopheles mosquito, the male micro-gametocytes go through a process of ex-flagellation in the mosquito's midgut, fusing with female macro-gametes to form a zygote. The zygote then reaches the stage of ookinete that migrates through a thin wall, matures into oocyst, producing and upon rupturing, releasing numerous sporozoites that are dispersed throughout mosquitos body, including salivary glands, therefore completing the lifecycle. Gametocytes are hence of vital importance to the transmission cycle of malaria. [2] [4] [7] The clinical symptoms are, however, predominantly a result of the asexual stages of parasite replication in human blood. [5]
Document 4 (Title: Plasmodium mackerrasae): Plasmodium mackerrasae is a parasite of the genus Plasmodium. Like all Plasmodium species P. mackerrasae has both vertebrate and insect hosts. The vertebrate hosts for this parasite are reptiles. Description The parasite was first described by Telford in 1979. Both schizonts and gametocytes parasitize all cells in the erythrocyte series. The presence of pigment in both asexual and sexual stages is correlated with maturity of the host cell. While asexual forms contain a single large vacuole, the mature gametocytes may show 1-4 vacuoles. The mature schizonts containing 6-12 nuclei arranged peripherally as a rosette. The gametocytes are round to oval and are equal to or slightly smaller than host cell nuclei. This species resembles Plasmodium sasai and Plasmodium tropiduri. It may be distinguished from these species by the following characteristics: P. sasai possess fan-shaped schizonts and its gametocytes are more heavily pigmented
Document 5 (Title: Malaria -- Pathophysiology): Five Plasmodium species possess the ability to infect humans: P. falciparum, P. ovale, P. vivax, P. malariae , and P. knowlesi . [2] The female Anopheles mosquito ingests gametes during a blood meal, which form sporozoites that replicate in the gut. [1] During subsequent bloodmeals, saliva containing sporozoites gets released into a human host's bloodstream. [1] Within 60 minutes, sporozoites reach the liver, invade hepatocytes, and then rapidly divide, forming merozoites. In an active infection, organisms reenter the bloodstream and invade erythrocytes. [1] [4] Within erythrocytes, Plasmodia consume hemoglobin and develop from immature trophozoites (ring stage) to either mature trophozoites or gametocytes (CDC Malaria 2019). Mature trophozoites replicate, forming schizonts, disrupting erythrocyte cell membrane integrity, and leading to capillary endothelial adherence and cell lysis. [1]
