Significant associated environmental exposures or lifestyle factors decrease the likelihood of a specific genetic disorder. In contrast, the absence of nonhereditary risk factors typically associated with a disease raises concern about a genetic association. A personal or family history of deep vein thrombosis in the absence of known environmental or medical risk factors suggests a hereditary thrombotic disorder. The physical examination may also provide important clues about the risk for a specific inherited disorder. A patient presenting with xanthomas at a young age should prompt consideration of familial hypercholesterolemia. The presence of trichilemmomas in a woman with breast cancer raises concern for Cowden syndrome, associated with PTEN",

Patients with increased risk for developing testicular cancer, including positive family history, cryptorchidism, and testicular atrophy, should be informed and trained accordingly. Primary care physicians hold clinical information and the family history of the patient. Therefore they should provide all significant information to carefully identify the high-risk patient, reassure and counsel the patient during all the course of the disease, and schedule checkups. Continuous support must entail not only from the medical staff but also from close family members and friends.",

        "content": "For an individual (who becomes the \"patient\" in this example), a blood test of, for example, serum calcium shows a result above the standard reference range, which, by most definitions, classifies as hypercalcemia, which becomes the \"presentation\" in this case. A clinician (who becomes the \"diagnostician\" in this example), who does not currently see the patient, gets to know about his finding. By practical reasons, the clinician considers that there is enough test indication to have a look at the patient's medical records. For simplicity, let's say that the only information given in the medical records is a family history of primary hyperparathyroidism (here abbreviated as PH), which may explain the finding of hypercalcemia. For this patient, let's say that the resultant hereditary risk factor is estimated to confer a relative risk of 10 (RRPH = 10).",

        "content": "To study the association of two well known risk factors for breast cancer and the association of knowledge of those risk factors with mammography utilization. Cross sectional: two independent random telephone surveys. Two Northeastern metropolitan communities surveyed in 1987 and in 1989. Women without breast cancer who spoke English and who were between 45 and 75 years of age. The two risk factors measured were a family history of breast cancer and being 65 or older. Participants were surveyed about their knowledge of risk factors, presence of risk factors, selected beliefs, attitudes, reinforcing factors and mammography use. Results were analyzed for women 50-75. There was a substantial increase in mammography use over the 2-year period. Having a positive family history or being older is not associated with increased mammography utilization. Knowledge that family history and/or age are risks is associated with increased utilization. However, knowledge of risk factors is not associated with having those risks. Older women have lower utilization than younger women regardless of their knowledge of age as a risk. Increased physician recommendation is associated with increased utilization. Since knowing that a factor is a risk and having a physician recommend mammography are each associated with increased use, we conclude that the primary care physicians' role in increasing mammography utilization is critical.",

        "content": "Contrary to the widespread belief that most elderly persons are institutionalized, 95 percent of people over age 65 live at home, and many are cared for, to some extent, by a relative. It has only recently been recognized that the family caregiver is at risk for increased physical and mental morbidity because of this often stressful task. If the situation is too stressful, elder abuse may result. Family physicians are in a good position to identify caregiver stress, recognize the danger signs of elder abuse, provide support, education and advice, and intervene when necessary. Primary care providers should routinely ask about caregiving responsibilities when obtaining the medical history of any patient over age 45.",
