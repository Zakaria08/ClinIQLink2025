        "content": "History of Present Illness: A 33-year-old\u00a0white female presents after admission to the general medical/surgical hospital ward with a chief complaint of shortness of breath on exertion. She reports that she was seen for similar symptoms previously at her primary care physician\u2019s office six months ago.\u00a0At that time, she was diagnosed with acute bronchitis and treated with bronchodilators, empiric antibiotics, and a short course oral steroid taper. This management did not improve her symptoms, and she has gradually worsened over six months. She reports a 20-pound (9 kg) intentional weight loss over the past year. She denies camping, spelunking, or hunting activities. She denies any sick contacts. A brief review of systems is negative for fever, night sweats, palpitations, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, neural sensation changes, muscular changes, and increased bruising or bleeding. She admits a cough, shortness of breath, and shortness of breath on exertion.",

        "title": "Orthotopic liver transplants necessitated by acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity.",
        "content": "Acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity has been recognized since 1966. Patients experiencing a massive hepatic insult due to acetaminophen (APAP) may recover with minimal residual complications or develop fulminant hepatic necrosis. We report 3 patients with hepatic failure due to an APAP overdose who received orthotopic liver transplants and survived. An 18-y-o female ingested 60 500 mg APAP tablets (30 g). She presented with tachycardia and lethargy stating that she had taken amoxipine, carbamazepine, and lorazepam. She began to recover but on day 2 experienced an upper gastrointestinal bleed and became hypotensive and hyperpyrexic. She developed hepatic encephalopathy and it was then determined she had ingested APAP. Her APAP level was 13 micrograms/ml 96 h post-ingestion. She was successfully transplanted 19 d post-ingestion with recovery. A 40-y-o female was admitted for flu-like symptoms persisting for 7 d. She was jaundiced, hyperventilating and hypotensive. She admitted ingesting approximately 17 g APAP over 36 h. Her APAP level was 12.2 micrograms/ml. Her condition worsened and on day 3 she was in grade IV coma. She was successfully transplanted 4 d post-arrival with recovery. A 16-y-o female ingested an unknown amount of APAP. She presented approximately 24 h post-ingestion with a serum APAP level of 130 micrograms/ml. Her condition deteriorated and she became encephalopathic with grade IV coma. She was successfully transplanted on day 7 post-arrival. Hepatotoxicity can occur as a result of either acute or chronic APAP overdose. Although n-acetylcysteine (NAC) is effective antidotal therapy, it must be used within 8-12 h post-ingestion to be optimally effective. Inaccurate patient histories may prevent NAC administration resulting in hepatotoxicity. Liver transplantation is a viable option to be considered in those APAP overdose patients who experience rapidly progressing encephalopathy, hemolysis, and hepato-renal failure.",
