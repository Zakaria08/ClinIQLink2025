Risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) According to a 2015 review, passive smoking may increase the risk of tuberculosis infection and accelerate the progression of the disease, but the evidence remains weak. The majority of studies on the association between secondhand smoke exposure and sinusitis have found a significant association between the two. Cognitive impairment and dementia: Exposure to secondhand smoke may increase the risk of cognitive impairment and dementia in adults 50 and over. Children exposed to secondhand smoke show reduced vocabulary and reasoning skills when compared with non-exposed children as well as more general cognitive and intellectual deficits. Mental health: Exposure to secondhand smoke is associated with an increased risk of depressive symptoms. During pregnancy: Miscarriage: a 2014 meta-analysis found that maternal secondhand smoke exposure increased the risk of miscarriage by 11%.",

According to epidemiological studies, smoking is a relevant risk factors connected to different types of cancers, as well as respiratory, cardiovascular, and mother-infant pathologies. In Chile 7% of the death toll can be blamed on smoking. The present information about cigarette consumption was obtained from the clinical record of 297 in-patients, discharged from the Psychiatric Clinic, University of Chile, between the year 1983 and the year 1985. Prevalence of smoking is 66.7%, with no difference per sex. 9.6% patients smoke more than 20 cigarettes a day. The prevailing clinical diagnoses are: Drug addiction (alcoholism excluded), 96.6%; schizophrenia, 81.7%; and alcoholism, 73.2%. Smoking is associated to a background of alcohol abuse, 78.9%, as well as other drug abuses, 89.7%: In other words, this is a statistically significant difference. In this study, it was found out that psychiatric in-patients were smoking more heavily than the general population--41%, and more heavily than somatic in-patients as well--42%.",

Several studies have shown that the respirable particulate load in any household is directly proportional to the number of cigarette smokers living in that home. Increases in prevalence of respiratory illnesses, especially asthma, and reduced levels of pulmonary function measured with simple spirometry have been found in the children of smoking parents in a number of studies. Recent meta-analyses for lung cancer and cardiopulmonary diseases, combining data from multiple secondhand tobacco smoke epidemiologic studies, suggest an ~25% increase in relative risk for each condition, even after adjustment for major potential confounders.",
