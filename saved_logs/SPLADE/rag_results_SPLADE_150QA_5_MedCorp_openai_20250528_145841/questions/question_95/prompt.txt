Document 1 (Title: Point of service plan): A point of service plan is a type of managed care health insurance plan in the United States. It combines characteristics of the health maintenance organization (HMO) and the preferred provider organization (PPO). The POS is based on a managed care foundation—lower medical costs in exchange for more limited choice. But POS health insurance does differ from other managed care plans. Enrollees in a POS plan are required to choose a primary care physician (PCP) from within the health care network; this PCP becomes their "point of service". The PCP may make referrals outside the network, but with lesser compensation offered by the patient's health insurance company. For medical visits within the health care network, paperwork is usually completed for the patient. If the patient chooses to go outside the network, it is the patient's responsibility to fill out forms, send bills in for payment, and keep an accurate account of health care receipts. References
Document 2 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Medicaid is a state–federal partnership whose greatest single expenditure is nursing home care. Thus, the need for chronic daily assistance with personal care in a nursing home consumes a large part of most state Medicaid budgets as well as personal assets. Accordingly, alternatives to chronic nursing-home care are of great interest to states, patients, and families. Some states have developed Medicaid-funded day-care programs, sometimes based on the Program for All-Inclusive Day programs Medical, surgical, and psychiatric services that cannot be provided in less complex settings Resuscitation, stabilization, triage, disposition Hospital-based residential program providing team-based, physician-supervised, intensive therapeutic rehabilitation for specific diagnoses Chronic, urgent, and preventive services Medical, nursing, and rehabilitative services after hospitalization, often based in hospitals or nursing homes
Document 3 (Title: Quality assurance and utilization review in a health insuring organization. The HealthPASS example.): HealthPASS is a Philadelphia-based health insurance organization (HIO), owned and operated by the Penn Health Corporation, a subsidiary of Maxicare, the large for-profit health maintenance organization (HMO) company based in California. In a contractual agreement with the Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare (DPW), Maxicare contracts primary care physician services on a capitated basis, and other services on a fee basis, to about 96,000 Medicaid enrollees in certain zip codes in Philadelphia. Although HealthPASS does not provide care directly, it contracts with providers for these medical services. HealthPASS serves a primarily poor, minority, and inner city population with high rates of drug abuse, alcoholism, and mental illness. Currently, the enrollees are served by a network of providers including more than 40 participating hospitals and over 500 primary care providers (PCPs) in the community. HealthPASS is unique as previous HIOs in Kentucky and Arizona both failed. This paper describes the quality assurance and utilization review (QA-UR) system implemented by HealthPASS with specific examples of case discussions and a detailed look at the structure and function of the internal review process. Before outlining the QA-UR system, a brief history is provided of the recent controversial trend toward managed care for Medicaid recipients, as there have been marked failures in this arena nationally. The HealthPASS system is described--what it is, how it is staffed, who it serves, and the health services it offers.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Document 4 (Title: Managed Care -- Definition/Introduction): Over time, some less traditional HMOs emerged where the PCP does not serve as the gatekeeper, and the patient may self-referral to a specialist. However, for the service to be covered and paid for by the managed care plan, the patient is still limited to only receiving care and service from network providers. HMOs' utilization and quality management programs collect much data on the care and services authorized and provided by the PCP and other providers. This data is communicated to the PCP and other network providers regularly as the financial incentives revolve around compliance with the managed care plan’s utilization and quality programs’ targets. For the patients, the financial incentive is that they receive insurance coverage only for services that occur within the network.
Document 5 (Title: Managed Care -- Definition/Introduction): The types of managed care insurance or benefit management approaches have also evolved. Initially, managed care was synonymous with a health maintenance organization or HMO approach. [6] In the traditional HMO model, patients enrolled select a primary care provider (PCP) who receives a PMPM to provide care and coordinate all services for that patient. The PCP serves as the patient’s gatekeeper for all necessary services and must provide a referral for the patient to be seen by a subspecialist or to receive imaging or laboratory studies. The PCP is expected to manage and oversee the care so that only appropriate care and services are provided according to available evidence or consistent with standardized care pathways. Only network providers are available to the patient in an HMO, so specialists, hospitals, pharmacies, imaging centers, and laboratories are preselected, credentialed, and contracted by the HMO. In the case of an HMO with a gatekeeper model, coverage is only available for care and services authorized by their PCP.
