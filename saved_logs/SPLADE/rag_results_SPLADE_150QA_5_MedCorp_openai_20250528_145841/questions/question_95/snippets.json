It combines characteristics of the health maintenance organization (HMO) and the preferred provider organization (PPO). The POS is based on a managed care foundation\u2014lower medical costs in exchange for more limited choice. But POS health insurance does differ from other managed care plans. Enrollees in a POS plan are required to choose a primary care physician (PCP) from within the health care network; this PCP becomes their \"point of service\". The PCP may make referrals outside the network, but with lesser compensation offered by the patient's health insurance company. For medical visits within the health care network, paperwork is usually completed for the patient. If the patient chooses to go outside the network, it is the patient's responsibility to fill out forms, send bills in for payment, and keep an accurate account of health care receipts. References",

        "content": "HealthPASS is a Philadelphia-based health insurance organization (HIO), owned and operated by the Penn Health Corporation, a subsidiary of Maxicare, the large for-profit health maintenance organization (HMO) company based in California. In a contractual agreement with the Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare (DPW), Maxicare contracts primary care physician services on a capitated basis, and other services on a fee basis, to about 96,000 Medicaid enrollees in certain zip codes in Philadelphia. Although HealthPASS does not provide care directly, it contracts with providers for these medical services. HealthPASS serves a primarily poor, minority, and inner city population with high rates of drug abuse, alcoholism, and mental illness. Currently, the enrollees are served by a network of providers including more than 40 participating hospitals and over 500 primary care providers (PCPs) in the community. HealthPASS is unique as previous HIOs in Kentucky and Arizona both failed. This paper describes the quality assurance and utilization review (QA-UR) system implemented by HealthPASS with specific examples of case discussions and a detailed look at the structure and function of the internal review process. Before outlining the QA-UR system, a brief history is provided of the recent controversial trend toward managed care for Medicaid recipients, as there have been marked failures in this arena nationally. The HealthPASS system is described--what it is, how it is staffed, who it serves, and the health services it offers.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
