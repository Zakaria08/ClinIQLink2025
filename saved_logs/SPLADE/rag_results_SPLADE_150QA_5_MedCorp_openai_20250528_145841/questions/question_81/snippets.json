        "title": "Vocal cord augmentation with autogenous fat.",
        "content": "Since 1987, the authors have used a new technique for the augmentation and medialization of the paralyzed vocal cord. Eleven patients with paralyzed vocal cords and one patient with a surgical defect of the vocal cord have been treated with intracordal injections of autogenous fat harvested by suction from the abdominal wall. Treatment efficacy was evaluated by both subjective and objective (videostroboscopic) analyses. Patient follow-up has ranged from 5 to 42 months. All patients showed significant improvement in voice characteristics. Marked reduction in air flow and increased vocal intensity were observed. Correction of glottic insufficiency has been lasting, indicating that the implanted fat cells are viable. At this time, there has been no evidence of loss of vocal cord substance. The natural qualities of autogenous fat appear to make it an excellent alternative to Teflon or collagen. The fat is readily available, and easily harvested and injected. A larger patient population and longer follow-up periods will help determine if these initial findings are consistent.",

        "title": "Reinke Edema -- Differential Diagnosis",
        "content": "The differential diagnosis for Reinke edema includes almost any diagnosis that can cause dysphonia. Neurologic, infectious, inflammatory, neoplastic, congenital, traumatic, and behavioral factors should all be considered in a patient with dysphonia. However, certain conditions may more closely mimic the presentation of Reinke edema. These conditions include acute and chronic laryngitis, benign and malignant tumors such as papilloma or squamous cell carcinoma, unilateral or bilateral vocal cord paresis or paralysis, presbyphonia, phonotraumatic lesions such as vocal fold nodules or hemorrhagic polyps, or functional dysphonia such as\u00a0that seen in muscle tension dysphonia. [22] Because Reinke edema is a relatively rare and benign condition, due diligence is required, even if, demographically, Reinke edema seems\u00a0the most likely diagnosis.",

        "content": "The free margin between these two points of attachment is thickened to form the vocal ligament, which is under the vocal fold (true vocal cord) of the larynx. The conus elasticus is also thickened anteriorly in the midline to form a distinct median cricothyroid ligament, which spans the distance between the arch of cricoid cartilage and the inferior thyroid notch and adjacent deep surface of the thyroid cartilage up to the attachment of the vocal ligaments. In emergency situations, when the airway is blocked above the level of the vocal folds, the median cricothyroid ligament can be perforated to establish an airway. Except for small vessels and the occasional presence of a pyramidal lobe of the thyroid gland, normally there are few structures between the median cricothyroid ligament and skin.",

        "content": "There are several factors that may predispose an individual to vocal fold nodules. Activities or professions that may contribute to phonotraumatic behaviors include cheerleading, untrained singing, speaking above noise, and teaching without voice amplification, as these increase mechanical stress and subsequent vocal fold trauma. Gender may be another predisposing factor, as vocal fold nodules occur more frequently in females. The presence of dehydration, respiratory infection, and inflammatory factors may also act as predisposing or aggravating factors. Inflammatory factors may include allergies, tobacco and alcohol use, laryngopharyngeal reflux, and other environmental influences.",
