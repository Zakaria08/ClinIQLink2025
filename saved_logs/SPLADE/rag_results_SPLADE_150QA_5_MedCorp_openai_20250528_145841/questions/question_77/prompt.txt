Document 1 (Title: Otosclerosis -- Evaluation -- High-Resolution Computed Tomography): Noncontrast, high-resolution computed tomography (CT) of the temporal bones is the gold standard for diagnosing otosclerosis (see Image. Otosclerosis). [58] In more overt cases, foci of spongiotic or sclerotic bone can be identified in the area anterior to the oval window. Additionally, the extent of thickening of the stapes footplate and round window involvement will inform the preoperative planning process. In cases of cochlear otosclerosis, a "halo sign" may be seen, in which radiolucent foci extend from the fissula ante fenestram around the cochlea itself. [59] A grading system suggested by Symons and Fanning can be used to characterize the severity of otosclerosis based on CT findings: [60]
Document 2 (Title: Ototoxicity): Ototoxicity is the property of being toxic to the ear (oto-), specifically the cochlea or auditory nerve and sometimes the vestibular system, for example, as a side effect of a drug. The effects of ototoxicity can be reversible and temporary, or irreversible and permanent. It has been recognized since the 19th century. There are many well-known ototoxic drugs used in clinical situations, and they are prescribed, despite the risk of hearing disorders, for very serious health conditions. Ototoxic drugs include antibiotics (such as gentamicin, streptomycin, tobramycin), loop diuretics (such as furosemide), and platinum-based chemotherapy agents (such as cisplatin and carboplatin). A number of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) have also been shown to be ototoxic. This can result in sensorineural hearing loss, dysequilibrium, or both. Some environmental and occupational chemicals have also been shown to affect the auditory system and interact with noise.
Document 3 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Halofantrine exhibits erratic bioavailability, but its absorption is significantly enhanced when it is taken with a fatty meal. The elimination half-life of halofantrine is 1–2 days; it is excreted mainly in feces. Halofantrine is metabolized into N-debutyl-halofantrine by the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP3A4. Grapefruit juice should be avoided during treatment because it increases both halofantrine’s bioavailability and halofantrine-induced QT interval prolongation by inhibiting CYP3A4 at the enterocyte level.
Document 4 (Title: [Study of the ototoxicity of amikacin and netilmicin using provoked acoustic oto-emissions and high-frequency audiometry].): To compare the ototoxicity of amikacin and netilmicin, tone audiometry, high-frequency audiometry, early auditory evoked potentials, and evoked otoacoustic emission testing were used to evaluate 30 patients (15 under amikacin and 15 under netilmicin). Ototoxicity was not significantly different in the two groups.
Document 5 (Title: Comparative clinical studies of ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity of amikacin and gentamicin.): A comparative study of the oto- and nephrotoxicity of amikacin and gentamicin was carried out prospectively. Twenty-six gentamicin-treated patients and 27 amikacin-treated patients were monitored for changes in auditory and renal function during and after therapy. Thirteen of those treated with gentamicin and 20 of those treated with amikacin underwent vestibular caloric testing which could be evaluated for evidence of toxicity. In four (15.4%) of the gentamicin-treated patients, nephrotoxicity developed; no such toxicity was seen in the amikacin-treated patients. This difference may have been due to a fortuitously higher incidence of pretreatment renal impairment in the gentamicin-treated group. In two gentamicin-treated patients (7.7%), ototoxicity developed (one auditory, one vestibular), and in two amikacin-treated patients (7.4%), auditory toxicity developed. Statistical analysis of oto- and nephrotoxicity and their risk factors was not attempted because of the small numbers of patients who could be evaluated. Additional patients are being studied.
