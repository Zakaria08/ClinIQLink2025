The instructional model has seven components: objectives standards anticipatory set teaching (input, modeling, checking for understanding) guided practice/monitoring closure independent practice The elements of effective instruction are very similar to those of the instructional model, featuring seven components of teaching and behavioral objectives: objectives set(hook) standards/expectations teaching (input, modeling/demo, direction giving, and checking for understanding) guided practice closure independent practice Hunter was the creator of Instructional Theory into Practice (ITIP).

        "content": "This study developed and evaluated an experiential teaching model which aimed to improve the integration of theory and practice for first-year RGN students. This work took a qualitative approach and used Lewin's action research methodology. Using a participant observation approach, data, in the form of diaries, interviews and spot checks, were gathered. To evaluate the teaching model, the spot checks were developed as an indicator of theory-practice integration. The analysis of these spot checks revealed that this teaching approach had value. The strengths and weaknesses of the teaching model, in relation to possible origins of the theory-practice gap, are outlined. The validity of action research is discussed, as are similar issues that are related to the methodology of this study.",

        "content": "Using a task trainer can allow for the creation of a simple teaching model leading to a standardized teaching approach and, ultimately, a sustainable outcome. For many years, the standard of practice in the medical community has been Halstead's \"See one, Do one, Teach one\" but this has become less acceptable, particularly when invasive procedures and high-risk care are involved. [4] [5] A more efficient model for teaching procedures that combines multiple aspects of adult learning is Peyton's 4 step approach (see Figure 1). [6] In this model, a teacher can demonstrate the procedure on the task trainer to the learner with no commentary as the first step.",
