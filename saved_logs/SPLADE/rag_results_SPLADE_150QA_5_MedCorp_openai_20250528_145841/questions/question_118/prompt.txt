Document 1 (Title: Diazepam -- Indications): Diazepam is an anxiolytic benzodiazepine, first patented and marketed in the United States in 1963. It is a fast-acting, long-lasting benzodiazepine commonly used to treat anxiety disorders and alcohol detoxification, acute recurrent seizures, severe muscle spasms, and spasticity associated with neurologic disorders. In acute alcohol withdrawal, diazepam is useful for symptomatic relief of agitation, tremor, alcoholic hallucinosis, and acute delirium tremens. [1] Benzodiazepines have largely replaced barbiturates in treating anxiety and sleep disorders because of their improved safety profile, fewer side effects, and flumazenil(antagonist) availability that can reverse oversedation in cases of benzodiazepine intoxication.

Document 2 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): TABLE 22–1 Pharmacokinetic properties of some benzodiazepines and newer hypnotics in humans. 1Time to peak blood level. 2Includes half-lives of major metabolites. because the elimination half-life of the parent drug may have little relation to the time course of pharmacologic effects. Benzodiazepines for which the parent drug or active metabolites have long half-lives are more likely to cause cumulative effects with multiple doses. Cumulative and residual effects such as excessive drowsiness appear to be less of a problem with such drugs as estazolam, oxazepam, and lorazepam, which have relatively short half-lives and are metabolized directly to inactive glucuronides. Some pharmacokinetic properties of selected benzodiazepines and newer hypnotics are listed in Table 22–1. The metabolism of several commonly used benzodiazepines including diazepam, midazolam, and triazolam is affected by inhibitors and inducers of hepatic P450 isozymes (see Chapter 4).
Document 3 (Title: Fludiazepam): Fludiazepam, marketed under the brand name Erispan (エリスパン) is a potent benzodiazepine and 2ʹ-fluoro derivative of diazepam, originally developed by Hoffman-La Roche in the 1960s. It is marketed in Japan and Taiwan. It exerts its pharmacological properties via enhancement of GABAergic inhibition. Fludiazepam has 4 times more binding affinity for benzodiazepine receptors than diazepam. It possesses anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, sedative, hypnotic and skeletal muscle relaxant properties. Fludiazepam has been used recreationally.

Document 4 (Title: Preclinical studies with pyrazolopyridine non-benzodiazepine anxiolytics: ICI 190,622.): Tracazolate is a pyrazolopyridine anxiolytic that enhances the binding of [3H]-flunitrazepam [( 3H]FLU) to brain tissue. The discovery that a metabolite of tracazolate, desbutyltracazolate, was a weak inhibitor of [3H]FLU binding led to the synthesis of a series of potent anxiolytics. From this series, ICI 190,622 emerged as a viable drug candidate, being a potent anxiolytic in rats and monkeys. This anxiolytic agent appears to produce only minimal sedation. Furthermore, ICI 190,622 appears less likely to potentiate the actions of ethanol than diazepam. ICI 190,622 is also a potent anticonvulsant (anti-metrazol ED50 = 1.1 mg/kg, PO) in rodents. Neurochemically, ICI 190,622 is similar to the benzodiazepine anxiolytics. In vitro, ICI 190,622 competitively inhibited [3H]FLU binding in cerebral cortex with an IC50 of 81 nM and was 4.3-fold more potent in the cerebellum (IC50 = 19 nM). This suggests a selectivity for the Type 1 benzodiazepine binding site. In contrast, diazepam showed similar affinities in both regions (cerebral cortex = 7 nM and cerebellum = 9 nM). Following oral administration, ICI 190,622 displaced [3H]FLU binding from cerebellar membranes more potently than diazepam (ED50 = 3 and 6 mg/kg, respectively, 1 hour after administration). Thus, ICI 190,622 should be an effective anxiolytic with significant advantages over benzodiazepines.
Document 5 (Title: Differential effects of the 1,4 and 1,5 benzodiazepines on performance in healthy man.): 1 The immediate and residual effects on performance of benzodiazepines differ, and the differences are important in the use of these drugs. 2. Diazepam and its hydroxylated metabolites, temazepam and oxazepam, each possess hypnotic activity, and have effects on performance limited to the sleep period. The demethylated metabolite of diazepam, nordiazepam, and its precursor, potassium clorazepate, which also possess hypnotic activity, have a longer duration of action, although the next day anxiolytic effect is accompanied by only minimal effects on performance. The 1.5 benzodiazepine, clobazam, seems to have minimal immediate effects on performance. 3 Diazepam and its hydroxylated metabolites, temazepam and oxazepam, would be useful in the management of insomnia without psychopathology in those cases in which residual effects on performance must be avoided. Nordiazepam and potassium clorazepate would be appropriate for insomnia secondary to day-time anxiety, and clobazam may be useful as a day-time anxiolytic. 4 It is emphasized that more work needs to be carried out on the effects of anxiolytics on performance before one can be certain that ingestion during the day would be without any deleterious effects on skilled work.
