Document 1 (Title: Naloxone -- Monitoring): For those whose respiratory depression is completely reversed with 0.4 to 2 mg of naloxone, observation in the emergency room for 2 to 4 hours is advised. If the patient is stable, discharge is recommended. In general, patients considered for discharge after reversal of the opioid overdose with naloxone should have: [27] A Glasgow coma scale of 15 No need for additional naloxone doses An oxygen saturation of at least 92% on room air A respiration rate of no less than 10 breaths/min A pulse rate of no less than 50 bpm or no more than 120 bpm A blood pressure between 110/90 and 140/90 mm Hg Tolerance for clear liquids, ambulation, and have no withdrawal symptoms Someone to drive home and monitor the patient for the next 12 to 24 hours
Document 2 (Title: Acute coronary syndrome): with pacemakers – especially the older models, since such devices developed in the last 30 years are bipolar and are generally not affected by the small electromagnetic fields generated by dental equipment. It is therefore important to know the type of pacemaker, the degree of electromagnetic protection of the generator, and the nature of the arrhythmia. If arrhythmia develops during dental treatment, the procedure should be suspended, oxygen is to be given, and the patient vital signs are to be assessed: body temperature (normal values: 35.5-37oC), pulse (normal values: 60-100 bpm), respiratory frequency (normal values in adults: 14-20 cycles or respirations per minute), blood pressure (normal values: systolic blood pressure under 140 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure under 90 mmHg). Sublingual nitrites are to be administered if there is chest pain. The patient should be placed in the Trendelenburg position, with vagal maneuvering where necessary (valsalva maneuver, massage in the
Document 3 (Title: Nasal oxygen alleviates hypoxemia in colonoscopy patients sedated with midazolam and meperidine.): A randomized study was carried out to determine whether the administration of oxygen (3 liter/min) via nasal prongs significantly affects arterial oxygenation during colonoscopy in patients sedated with intravenous midazolam (2.6 +/- 0.2 mg, means +/- SE) and meperidine (48 +/- 3 mg). Patients who received supplemental oxygen were less likely to become hypoxic (pulse oximeter reading, SpO2 less than 90%) than those who breathed room air (10 of 28 vs. 22 of 28, p less than 0.005). Similarly, the total time during which SpO2 was below 90% was significantly less in patients receiving nasal oxygen (0.7 +/- 0.3 min) than in patients breathing room air (9.7 +/- 1.9 min, p less than 0.001). Minimum oxygen saturations were significantly higher in patients receiving oxygen (90.6 +/- 0.8%) than in patients breathing air (86.5 +/- 0.8%, p less than 0.001). In patients breathing air, there was a significant negative correlation between the dose of meperidine and the minimum observed oxygen saturation; conversely, midazolam dose did not correlate with indices of hypoxemia. The authors conclude that administration of oxygen via nasal prongs can reduce the risk of hypoxemia during colonoscopy. However, since hypoxemia may occur even when nasal oxygen is given, continuous monitoring of arterial oxygenation is recommended.
Document 4 (Title: Pulse oximetry): Pulse oximetry is particularly convenient for noninvasive continuous measurement of blood oxygen saturation. In contrast, blood gas levels must otherwise be determined in a laboratory on a drawn blood sample. Pulse oximetry is useful in any setting where a patient's oxygenation is unstable, including intensive care, operating, recovery, emergency and hospital ward settings, pilots in unpressurized aircraft, for assessment of any patient's oxygenation, and determining the effectiveness of or need for supplemental oxygen. Although a pulse oximeter is used to monitor oxygenation, it cannot determine the metabolism of oxygen, or the amount of oxygen being used by a patient. For this purpose, it is necessary to also measure carbon dioxide (CO2) levels. It is possible that it can also be used to detect abnormalities in ventilation. However, the use of a pulse oximeter to detect hypoventilation is impaired with the use of supplemental oxygen, as it is only when patients breathe room air that

He does smoke a half pack of cigarettes a day, drinks alcohol socially, and denies any recreational drug use. He notes no inherited medical conditions in his family. Vital signs on arrival: Blood pressure (BP) 120/73 Heart rate (HR) 60 RR 18 Temperature: 35.6 C Oxygen saturation: 98% on room air Height 5'10" (178 cm) Weight 154 lbs (70 kg)
Document 6 (Title: Oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate premedication in children.): The authors evaluated the safety and efficacy of four doses of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate (OTFC) as a premedicant in 44 children about to undergo elective operations. The patients received 5-10, 10-15, 15-20, or 20-25 micrograms.kg-1 of OTFC in the holding area and had activity (sedation) scores, vital signs (including systolic and diastolic arterial blood pressures, heart, and respiratory rates), and pulse oximetry determined oxygen saturation measured before and at 15-min intervals after premedication until they were taken to the operating room. Cooperation during anesthetic induction, and quality and speed of recovery room emergence were measured and side effects noted. OTFC was readily accepted and provided significant (dose dependent) reductions in preoperative activity starting after 30 min. Onset of sedation was related to dose of OTFC but time to peak effect was not. Vital signs remained unchanged preoperatively in all groups but patients receiving 20-25 micrograms.kg-1 had oxygen saturations that were significantly lower than patients in the other groups 30 min after beginning OTFC consumption. Three of the 12 patients receiving the highest dose of OTFC experienced transient oxygen saturation less than 90% which, however, was easily treated by commands to take a breath. Anesthetic inductions were rated good or excellent in 80% of the patients and recovery times were similar irrespective of the OTFC dose. OTFC caused dose-independent preoperative pruritus in 90% or more of patients and pruritus (33%-70%), nausea (30%-58%), and vomiting (50%-83%) postoperatively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Document 7 (Title: Anatomy_Gray): A 53-year-old man presented to the emergency department with a 5-hour history of sharp pleuritic chest pain and shortness of breath. The day before he was on a long haul flight, returning from his holidays. He was usually fit and well and was a keen mountain climber. He had no previous significant medical history. On physical examination his lungs were clear, he was tachypneic at 24/min, and his saturation was reduced to 92% on room air. Pulmonary embolism was suspected and the patient was referred for a CT pulmonary angiogram. The study demonstrated clots within the right and left main pulmonary arteries. There was no pleural effusion, lung collapse, or consolidation. He was immediately started on subcutaneous enoxaparin and converted to oral anticoagulation over the course of a couple of days. The whole treatment lasted 6 months as no other risk factors (except immobilization during a long haul flight) were identified. There were no permanent sequelae.
Document 8 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): A 45-year-old man is brought to the local hospital emer-gency department by ambulance. His wife reports that he had been in his normal state of health until 3 days ago when he developed a fever and a productive cough. Dur-ing the last 24 hours he has complained of a headache and is increasingly confused. His wife reports that his medical history is significant only for hypertension, for which he takes hydrochlorothiazide and lisinopril, and that he is allergic to amoxicillin. She says that he developed a rash many years ago when prescribed amoxicillin for bron-chitis. In the emergency department, the man is febrile (38.7°C [101.7°F]), hypotensive (90/54 mmHg), tachypneic (36/min), and tachycardic (110/min). He has no signs of meningismus but is oriented only to person. A stat chest x-ray shows a left lower lung consolidation consistent with pneumonia. A CT scan is not concerning for lesions or elevated intracranial pressure. The plan is to start empiric antibiotics and perform a
Document 9 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): Helge Eilers, MD, & Spencer Yost, MD An elderly man with type 2 diabetes mellitus and ischemic pain in the lower extremity is scheduled for femoral-to-popliteal artery bypass surgery. He has a history of hyper-tension and coronary artery disease with symptoms of stable angina. He can walk only half a block before pain in his legs forces him to stop. He has a 50-pack-year smoking history but stopped 2 years ago. Medications include atenolol, atorvastatin, and hydrochlorothiazide. The nurse in the preoperative holding area obtains the following vital signs: temperature 36.8°C (98.2°F), blood pressure 168/100 mm Hg, heart rate 78 bpm, oxygen saturation by pulse oximeter 96% while breathing room air, and pain 5/10 in the right lower leg after walking into the hospital. What anesthetic agents will you choose for his anesthetic plan? Why? Does the choice of anesthetic make a difference?

Ultrasound reveals a deep vein thrombosis in the left lower extremity; chest computed tomography scan confirms the presence of pulmonary emboli. Laboratory blood tests indicate elevated d-dimer levels. What therapy is indicated acutely? What are the long-term therapy options? How long should she be treated? Should this indi-vidual use oral contraceptives? A 25-year-old woman presents to the emergency depart-ment complaining of acute onset of shortness of breath and pleuritic pain. She had been in her usual state of health until 2 days prior when she noted that her left leg was swollen and red. Her only medication was oral contraceptives. Family history was significant for a history of “blood clots” in mul-tiple members of the maternal side of her family. Physical examination demonstrates an anxious woman with stable vital signs.

Document 11 (Title: [Bronchiectasis treated with negative extra-thoracic pressure ventilation].): A 25-year old man with 5-year history of bronchiectasis was admitted to the ICU complaining of severe shortness of breath. He had a respiratory rate of 40 to 50 breath/min. On 0.5 l/min of oxygen with nasal cannula, arterial blood pH was 7.39, Paco2 52.3 mmHg, Pao2 45.0 mmHg. Then, on 1 l/min of oxygen, Pao2 was unchanged, but Paco2 increased to 58 mmHg. As his consciousness was so clear, we applied to him the negative extra-thoracic pressure ventilator which was designed by the authors. Negative extra-thoracic pressure ventilation (NETPV) was maintained at a IMV rate of 30 breath/min, peak negative extra-thoracic pressure of -20 to -30 cmH2O, and an inspiratory/expiratory ratio of 1:2. During NETPV, his respiratory rate and oxygen consumption were decreased and Pao2 was increased compared with his spontaneous breathing. He made a recovery from dyspnea, especially, he was able to take a deep breath. When NETPV was applied to him, pulmonary artery and arterial catheterizations revealed that central venous pressure was slightly decreased, cardiac index unchanged or slightly decreased, heart rate, systemic blood pressure, and pulmonary arterial pressure unchanged compared with spontaneous breathing. The patient was able to read books and maintained communication in his voice with his family and the medical staff. After 3 days of the treatment with NETPV, a marked improvement was noted and the patient was discharged from the ICU. NETPV has the benefits as follows. First, it is very easy for both a patient and a doctor to assist his breathing because an endotracheal intubation is not necessary.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Document 12 (Title: Vibrio vulnificus Infection  -- History and Physical): Septic patients presenting for care will generally, but not always, appear very ill. Vital signs must be determined promptly, and include blood pressure, pulse rate, respiratory rate, pulse-oximetry, core temperature, and pain level. Patients with temperatures exceeding 38 C or below 36 C should immediately initiate screening for sepsis. Similarly, patients with any marked elevation of their heart rate (greater than 90 bpm) or respiratory rate (greater than 20/min) should heighten suspicion of sepsis. Blood pressure should be measured lying, seated, and standing (unless dizziness is induced). Parameters for septic shock in adults are a systolic BP less than 90 mmHg, OR a mean arterial pressure (MAP) less than 60, or a 40 mmHg drop in systolic pressure from the patient’s known prior ‘normal’ systolic pressure. Sepsis is seen on arrival in over 50% of patients presenting with V. vulnificus .
Document 13 (Title: Nasal cannula): The nasal cannula was invented by Wilfred Jones and patented in 1949 by his employer, BOC. Applications Supplemental oxygen A nasal cannula is generally used wherever small amounts of supplemental oxygen are required, without rigid control of respiration, such as in oxygen therapy. Most cannulae can only provide oxygen at low flow rates—up to 5 litres per minute (L/min)—delivering an oxygen concentration of 28–44%. Rates above 5 L/min can result in discomfort to the patient, drying of the nasal passages, and possibly nose bleeds (epistaxis). Also with flow rates above 6 L/min, the laminar flow becomes turbulent and the oxygen therapy being delivered is only as effective as delivering 5–6 L/min.
Document 14 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): Her social history is significant for alcohol use (three to four glasses of wine/night). Her vital signs include the following: temperature 99.8°F, blood pressure 132/64 mm Hg, pulse 78 bpm, and respiratory rate 15/min. On physical examination, she had left upper abdominal tenderness with evidence of hepatomegaly and mild scleral icterus. Laboratory data revealed the following: alanine aminotransferase, 527 IU/L (normal 10–35 IU/L); aspartate aminotransferase, 425 IU/L (normal < 35 IU/L); and bilirubin, 2.9 mg/dL (normal 0.1–0.3 mg/dL). What medications do OTC cold and flu preparations typically contain? Which of the OTC medications might have contrib-uted to the patient’s current symptoms? KH, a 55-year-old woman, presents to the emergency department with nausea, vomiting, and complaints of new-onset flu symptoms over the past several days. Her past medical history is significant for allergic rhinitis and chronic lower back pain secondary to a work-related fall 2 years ago. Her
