Document 1 (Title: Peripheral artery disease): Signs and symptoms The signs and symptoms of peripheral artery disease are based on the part of the body that is affected. About 66% of patients affected by PAD either do not have symptoms or have atypical symptoms. The most common presenting symptom is intermittent claudication, which causes pain and severe cramping when walking or exercising. The pain is usually located in the calf muscles of the affected leg and relieved by rest. This occurs because during exercise the muscles of the leg need more oxygen. Normally, the arteries would be able to increase the amount of blood flow and therefore increase the amount of oxygen going to the exercised leg. However, in PAD, the artery is unable to respond appropriately to the increased demand for oxygen by the muscles, as a result, the leg muscles are overly saturated with lactic acid, resulting in pain of the muscle that only goes away with rest. Other symptoms may include
Document 2 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): Helge Eilers, MD, & Spencer Yost, MD An elderly man with type 2 diabetes mellitus and ischemic pain in the lower extremity is scheduled for femoral-to-popliteal artery bypass surgery. He has a history of hyper-tension and coronary artery disease with symptoms of stable angina. He can walk only half a block before pain in his legs forces him to stop. He has a 50-pack-year smoking history but stopped 2 years ago. Medications include atenolol, atorvastatin, and hydrochlorothiazide. The nurse in the preoperative holding area obtains the following vital signs: temperature 36.8°C (98.2°F), blood pressure 168/100 mm Hg, heart rate 78 bpm, oxygen saturation by pulse oximeter 96% while breathing room air, and pain 5/10 in the right lower leg after walking into the hospital. What anesthetic agents will you choose for his anesthetic plan? Why? Does the choice of anesthetic make a difference?
Document 3 (Title: Case Study: 32-Year-Old Male Presenting with Right Lower Quadrant Abdominal Pain (Archived) -- Case Presentation): The patient denies prior abdominal surgeries. He does smoke a half pack of cigarettes a day, drinks alcohol socially, and denies any recreational drug use. He notes no inherited medical conditions in his family. Vital signs on arrival: Blood pressure (BP) 120/73 Heart rate (HR) 60 RR 18 Temperature: 35.6 C Oxygen saturation: 98% on room air Height 5'10" (178 cm) Weight 154 lbs (70 kg)
Document 4 (Title: Post-polio syndrome: a review and case report.): A 21-year-old Thai man presented with progressive weakness and atrophy of both hands for 2 years. His left leg was atrophic and weak secondary to poliomyelitis since he was 8 months old. Physical examination showed that there was atrophy of both hands and forearms as well as left leg. Sensation was normal. Deep tendon reflexes were normal except for hyporeflexia of left leg. EMG showed chronic denervation pattern in the recent atrophic muscles and in normal power muscles. Motor and sensory nerve conductions were normal. Biopsy of forearm muscle revealed degeneration and fibrosis of muscle fibers. These findings were compatible with post-polio syndrome (PPS) which presents in patients with late paralysis following poliomyelitis. It is not a form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis although some clinical similarities exist. Weakness from PPS may lead to musculoskeletal pain and increased functional disability. Proper rehabilitation program is to maintain his functional status and allow him to continue to live as independently as possible by regular exercise without stressing joints and muscles.
Document 5 (Title: Paralytic illness of Franklin D. Roosevelt): August 25: Roosevelt's temperature was 100 °F (38 °C). Both legs were paralyzed. His back muscles were weak. There was also weakness of the face and left hand. Pain in the legs and inability to urinate continued. After a brief conference with Keen, Lovett saw Roosevelt. Lovett informed him that the "physical findings" presented a "perfectly clear" diagnosis of poliomyelitis. Lovett ordered an end to massage, which had no benefit and caused pain, and recommended a trained nurse to care for Roosevelt. September 1: Roosevelt was still unable to urinate. His leg pain continued. September 14: Roosevelt was transported to New York, by boat and train, a long and painful journey.
Document 6 (Title: Case Study: 86-Year-Old Male With Leg Swelling After Hip Surgery (Archived) -- Case Presentation): An 86-year-old male was noted to have left lower extremity swelling after an uneventful left hip surgery performed for a fracture after a fall down a stairwell two months prior. His other medical co-morbidities include hypertension, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and hyperlipidemia. He denied shortness of breath, prior leg swelling, pain at rest, or foot discoloration.
Document 7 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): A 45-year-old man is brought to the local hospital emer-gency department by ambulance. His wife reports that he had been in his normal state of health until 3 days ago when he developed a fever and a productive cough. Dur-ing the last 24 hours he has complained of a headache and is increasingly confused. His wife reports that his medical history is significant only for hypertension, for which he takes hydrochlorothiazide and lisinopril, and that he is allergic to amoxicillin. She says that he developed a rash many years ago when prescribed amoxicillin for bron-chitis. In the emergency department, the man is febrile (38.7°C [101.7°F]), hypotensive (90/54 mmHg), tachypneic (36/min), and tachycardic (110/min). He has no signs of meningismus but is oriented only to person. A stat chest x-ray shows a left lower lung consolidation consistent with pneumonia. A CT scan is not concerning for lesions or elevated intracranial pressure. The plan is to start empiric antibiotics and perform a
Document 8 (Title: Anatomy_Gray): A 53-year-old man presented to the emergency department with a 5-hour history of sharp pleuritic chest pain and shortness of breath. The day before he was on a long haul flight, returning from his holidays. He was usually fit and well and was a keen mountain climber. He had no previous significant medical history. On physical examination his lungs were clear, he was tachypneic at 24/min, and his saturation was reduced to 92% on room air. Pulmonary embolism was suspected and the patient was referred for a CT pulmonary angiogram. The study demonstrated clots within the right and left main pulmonary arteries. There was no pleural effusion, lung collapse, or consolidation. He was immediately started on subcutaneous enoxaparin and converted to oral anticoagulation over the course of a couple of days. The whole treatment lasted 6 months as no other risk factors (except immobilization during a long haul flight) were identified. There were no permanent sequelae.
Document 9 (Title: [An autopsy case of carcinomatous sensory neuropathy associated with gastric adenosquamous carcinoma].): A 61-year-old man was admitted on May 1986 with complaints of hypesthesia and pain in the both legs, and of progressive difficulty in walking. Physical examination was unremarkable. On neurological examination, deep tendon reflexes were decreased in all extremities without pathological reflexes. Vibration sense was decreased severely at the medial malleolus and moderately at the anterior superior iliac spine. Joint sensation of the toes was moderately decreased. Light touch, temperature discrimination, and pinprick sensation were slightly decreased on fingers bilaterally and distal to the middle part of both legs. Muscle strength was normal. His gait was unsteady and Romberg's sign was positive. Finger to nose test and heel to knee test were mildly disturbed bilaterally. The sural nerve action potential was not elicited on electrical stimulation. Laboratory studies for malignancy showed gastric cancer. Only July 4, he underwent subtotal gastrectomy. Histologically it showed adenosquamous carcinoma. Postoperatively gait disturbance and pain in both legs improved slightly. Peak latencies of P2 of SEP following right and left posterior tibial nerve stimulation were 47. 9 msec and 48.8 msec on February 14, and 44.5 msec and 43.9 msec on October 6, 1986, respectively, and their postoperative shortening was evident. He died of multiple liver and lung metastasis of the gastric cancer in November 28, 1986. At autopsy, tumor metastasis were noted in liver, lung and perigastroduodenal and retroperitoneal lymph nodes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Document 10 (Title: [The protrusion of thoracic intervertebral disc-thoracic spondylosis (author's transl)].): The protrusion of cervical intervertebral discs was divided into three pathological entities by Spurling; soft disc, hard disc and spondylosis. We applied these concept to the dorsal intervertebral disc disease and treated two cases of thoracic spondylosis. Case 1. A 41-year-old male entered the hospital because of the gradual progression of weakness of both legs of two months' duration. Since ten days before admission he had not had an errection and had not been to able to walk and micturate. He also complained of paresthesia radiating down the abdomen into both legs. There were no visceral complaints. Neurological examination revealed severe weakness of both legs with bilateral impairment of deep sensations and hypalgesia up to the level of T6. Reflexes in both legs were hyperactive with sustained clonus. Plantar responses were extensor bilaterally. Though plain X-rays showed no changes, tomography revealed a calcified intervertebral spur formation at the T5-6 interspace. A myelogram showed a complete block of the contrast medium at the level of the upper part of T6. The patient underwent a complete laminectomy from T3 through T6 and extradural anterior decompression with the removal of the calcified disc at the T5-6 interspace using an air drill. Postoperatively, he demonstrated an immediate improvement in sensation and a gradual recovery in motor power. At his follow-up examination 14 months after surgery he could walk without assistance. Case 2. A 47-year-old dwarfish woman (130 cm) with a low back pain and difficulty in walking for a few years duration was admitted. A few months before admission she felt pain at her left lateral abdomen. There was weakness of both legs, greater in the left. Reflexes in her left lower extremity were hyperactive with sustained clonus. Plantar responces were flexor bilaterally. Palin X-rays showed scoliosis of thoracic spine with the top at T7 level and calcified intervertebral masses at T10-11, T11-12 and T12-L1, extending into the canal that were confirmed more clearly by tomography. Myelography by a cisternal puncture disclosed a complete block at the level of T10. The patient underwent total laminectomy of T9 through L2 and extradural anterior decompression with the removal of calcified discs. At her follow-up examination 12 months after surgery she could walk for herself with some residual neurological signs, minimal weakness in the right leg and hypesthesia up to the level of T12 in the left. We have discussed the incidental, related diagnostic and operative problems of this disease.
Document 11 (Title: [Chronic demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy associated with malignant histiocytosis].): A case of malignant histiocytosis (MH) presenting with peripheral nerve involvement is described. A 67-year-old man initially noted left facial weakness on July 20, 1986. The symptom was improved within a week, however, two weeks later he noticed numbness in his fingers and a burning pain in his legs, which was followed by double vision and progressive weakness in all four limbs. On examination, he was found to have total ophthalmoparesis of the right eye and a trace of the left facial palsy. There was severe weakness of the leg muscles, as well as mild weakness of the arms. This was accompanied by wasting of his limbs. All tendon reflexes were absent. Planter responses were flexor. Although cutaneous sensation was intact, vibratory sense was markedly impaired in the legs below the knees. The sphincter function was mildly disturbed. The sedimentation rate was 32 mm/hr. The hemoglobin was 11.9 g/dl and the leukocyte count was 5,700/mm3. The platelet count fell to 60,000/mm3. Results of routine biochemical and radiological studies were unremarkable. The cerebrospinal fluid protein level was 129 mg/dl with a normal cell count. Motor nerve conduction study revealed marked reduction in amplitude of the compound muscle action potential, slow motor nerve conduction velocities and multifocal conduction blocks along the nerve trunks (the left ulnar nerve in the forearm, the bilateral tibial nerve in the lower leg). F-wave was absent or elicited with prolonged latency and with increased chrono-dispersion. Sensory nerve had normal or nearly normal conduction. EMG sampling showed an impaired interference pattern during voluntary contraction and a few denervation potentials at rest.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Document 12 (Title: Case Study: 32-Year-Old Male Presenting with Right Lower Quadrant Abdominal Pain (Archived) -- Case Presentation): He describes the pain as coming on suddenly and sharp in nature.   Since the onset, his pain started to improve until the morning of his presentation to the emergency department, when it acutely worsened. He says that the pain is much worse with movement.
Document 13 (Title: Geriatric care management): which includes demographic type data as well as a health history, social history, and legal/financial history. From there, a medication profile assessment is included, as well as an assessment of ADLs (Activities of Daily Living) and IADLs (Instrumental Activities of Daily Living). In addition other assessments may include; Falls risk assessment, Home safety assessment, Nutritional assessment, Depression assessment, Pain assessment, Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE), MiniCog Clock Drawing Exam (Cognitive Assessment), Balance assessment, and Gait assessment(ability to walk). If the comprehensive geriatric care management assessment is being conducted by a Registered Nurse, then a physical assessment can be included such as vitals signs recording temperature, pulse, respirations, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and sometimes FBS or RBS (Fasting or Random Blood Sugar) checks for diabetics. In addition, physical assessments in areas such as cardiopulmonary, gastrointestinal,
Document 14 (Title: Case Study: 86-Year-Old Male With Leg Swelling After Hip Surgery (Archived) -- Case Presentation): The physical exam was remarkable for regular cardiac rhythm and palpable bilateral femoral, popliteal, and pedal pulses. Notably, the left popliteal pulse was very prominent, with a visible pulsatile mass in the left popliteal fossa. Lower extremity edema 1+ was noted from the patient’s left ankle to his knee. The patient was neurologically intact at the time of presentation.
Document 15 (Title: Case Study: 24-Year-Old Male Presenting With Polyarthralgias (Archived) -- Case Presentation): A 24-year-old white male with no known medical history presented to the hospital with chief complaints of 2 weeks of progressively worsening pain and swelling of his right wrist and left ankle joints. He did not report any fevers, chills, night sweats, weight loss or rash. He was employed as a fireman. He denied alcohol use disorder, smoking cigarettes, or any recreational drugs. Family history was significant for hypertension in father and ovarian cancer in the mother. His vital signs were within normal limits on presentation. On physical examination, the patient had significant swelling of multiple joints including the right wrist, right elbow, and left ankle. The joints were erythematous and tender to touch. Due to severe pain, he had limited range in the involved joints.
