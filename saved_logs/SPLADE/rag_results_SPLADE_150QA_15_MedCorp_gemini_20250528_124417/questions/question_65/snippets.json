In the majority of cases, there is no obvious cause of dyspnea, but as skeletal myopathy is also common in thyrotoxic patients, it has been postulated that increased dyspnea could be secondary to respiratory muscle weakness. We sought to determine whether thyrotoxic patients were in fact more dyspneic on exertion than age- and sex-matched controls, and if so, whether the increased dyspnea was secondary to respiratory muscle weakness. The study group consisted of 12 thyrotoxic patients and 12 control subjects matched for age and gender. We measured lung volumes, compliance, elastic recoil, respiratory muscle strength, maximal exercise performance, and the intensity of breathlessness (modified Borg scale) at various levels of exercise in all subjects. The respiratory muscles were weaker in patients than controls. This weakness improved in treated patients (p less than 0.05) with concomitant increases in VC, IC, and TLC (all p less than 0.05). Despite this, we found no differences in breathlessness intensity scores between patients and controls or in patients before and after successful antithyroid therapy.",

Chronic chest pain has a prevalence of 12% and is associated with high utilization of health care.

A number of studies that fail to support a unitary theory of causation of noncardiac chest pain are described. A multifactorial, interactive model is proposed, with contributions from physical factors, such as palpitations and intercostal muscle pain; psychologic factors, which include enhanced awareness of and selective attention to bodily sensation; and environmental factors, such as previous exposure to cardiorespiratory disease in first-degree relatives or significant others. Although there have been few controlled intervention studies in patients with unexplained cardiorespiratory symptoms, there is evidence for the efficacy of both drug treatments and psychologic treatment. The results of intervention studies in patients with chest pain and normal coronary arteries are eagerly awaited. Atypical chest pain and breathlessness are common causes of office consultations and/or functional disability.
