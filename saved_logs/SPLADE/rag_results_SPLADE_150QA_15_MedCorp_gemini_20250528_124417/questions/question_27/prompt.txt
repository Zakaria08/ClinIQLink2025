Document 1 (Title: [Suprasellar arachnoid cyst associated with precocious puberty: report of an operated case and review of the literature].): The pathogenesis remains unknown in the majority of patients with precocious puberty, and yet infrequently such causative cerebral lesions as hypothalamic hamartomas are associated with sexual precocity. We reported a rare case of suprasellar arachnoid cyst in an infant presenting with precocious puberty, which eventually disappeared after a cyst-peritoneal shunt. It was believed that the mass effect of the arachnoid cyst upon the hypothalamus was, at least in part, responsible for development of precocious puberty. The role of surgical decompression of the cyst was also discussed. A one-year-old girl was admitted to the hospital for evaluation of genital bleeding which had persisted on and off for two months. The height, 80cm, and the weight, 12.4kg, exceeded by far the two standard deviations from the mean level of the normal population. In addition she had the development of breast tissue as classified Tanner's Stage II, and both pubic and axillary hair. The bone age by skeletal survey of the hand was rated as 3 years. Endocrinological examination showed that serum levels of luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol had increased for her age, to levels equivalent to those for females at puberty. An LH-RH test revealed an excessive LH reaction. There were no definite neurological deficits. CT and MRI demonstrated the presence of a large arachnoid cyst involving the suprasellar region as well as the right middle and posterior fossa. After the patient underwent a cyst-peritoneal shunt, the cyst decreased in size and such symptoms as genital bleeding and breast growth disappeared. Serum levels of her LH and FSH also significantly decreased.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Document 2 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): Camille E. Beauduy, PharmD, & Lisa G. Winston, MD motion tenderness is present. A first-catch urine specimen is obtained for chlamydia and gonorrhea nucleic acid amplifi-cation testing. A urine pregnancy test is also ordered as the patient reports she “missed her last period.” Pending these results, the decision is made to treat her presumptively for chlamydial cervicitis. What are two potential treatment options for her possible chlamydial infection? How does her potential pregnancy affect the treatment decision? A 22-year-old woman presents to her college medical clinic complaining of a 2-week history of vaginal discharge. She denies any fever or abdominal pain but does report vaginal bleeding after sexual intercourse. When questioned about her sexual activity, she reports having vaginal intercourse, at times unprotected, with two men in the last 6 months. A pelvic examination is performed and is positive for muco-purulent discharge from the endocervical canal. No cervical
Document 3 (Title: McCune–Albright syndrome): Precocious puberty: The most common endocrinopathy is precocious puberty, which presents in girls (~85%) with recurrent estrogen-producing cysts leading to episodic breast development, growth acceleration, and vaginal bleeding. Precocious puberty may also occur in boys with McCune–Albright syndrome, but is much less common (~10–15%). In children of both sexes, growth acceleration may lead to tall stature in childhood, however premature bone maturation may lead to early growth plate fusion and short stature in adulthood. Testicular abnormalities: Testicular abnormalities are seen in a majority (~85%) of boys with McCune–Albright syndrome. These typically present with macro-orchidism. On pathology lesions show Leydig and Sertoli cell hyperplasia. Hyperthyroidism: Hyperthyroidism occurs in approximately one-third of patients with McCune Albright syndrome. Patients have characteristic abnormalities on thyroid ultrasound, and may have a slight increased risk for thyroid cancer.
Document 4 (Title: Case Study: 33-Year-Old Female Presents with Chronic SOB and Cough (Archived) -- Case Presentation): History of Present Illness: A 33-year-old white female presents after admission to the general medical/surgical hospital ward with a chief complaint of shortness of breath on exertion. She reports that she was seen for similar symptoms previously at her primary care physician’s office six months ago. At that time, she was diagnosed with acute bronchitis and treated with bronchodilators, empiric antibiotics, and a short course oral steroid taper. This management did not improve her symptoms, and she has gradually worsened over six months. She reports a 20-pound (9 kg) intentional weight loss over the past year. She denies camping, spelunking, or hunting activities. She denies any sick contacts. A brief review of systems is negative for fever, night sweats, palpitations, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, neural sensation changes, muscular changes, and increased bruising or bleeding. She admits a cough, shortness of breath, and shortness of breath on exertion.
Document 5 (Title: [A case of fibrous dysplasia (McCune Albright syndrome) associated with acromegaly].): We report a case of a 47-year-old woman with McCune-Albright syndrome associated with unusual growth-hormone and prolactin hypersecretion. Acromegaly was suspected on clinical examination, and she was referred to us. She had no history of precocious puberty or pathological fracture. She was 154cm tall, weighing 62kg with so-called acromegalic facies. There were two lumps, one of which was on her right lateral forehead. The other on the right lower extremity seemed to be due to a bone deformity. Some brown pigmented macules with irregular borders were present on her lips and oral mucosa. Endocrine examination revealed elevated basal levels of plasma GH (54ng/ml) and PRL (36.2ng/ml), which paradoxically increased after injection of TRH. Plasma levels of these hormones did not change after LHRH test, and plasma GH level increased after GHRH test. A skull X-ray film showed a double floor of the sella turcia and hyperostotic formation of the right sphenoid bone. MRI and CT showed a tumor shadow in the right sella turcica. Bone roentogenography of the right fibula and tibia showed a large centrally expanding lesion with a ground-glass or cystic appearance and a thin cortex. The left fibula showed a similar lesion. We recognized similar findings in other bones which also showed abnormal accumulation in a radionuclide bone scan with 99mTc. On the basis of physical, endocrinological and roentogenographical examination, we diagnosed her as displaying McCune-Albright syndrome. We operated on her by transsphenoidal surgery and confirmed a functioning chromophobe adenoma which was removed during surgery. She has been free of GH and PRL hypersecretion since then. The pathology of the sphenoidal sinus affected with fibrous bone was in accordance with the findings of fibrous dysplasia. McCune-Albright syndrome (MCAS) is known as a syndrome characterized by polyostotic fibrous dysplasia and cutaneous pigmentation and multiple endocrinopathy. Its etiology is unknown. This syndrome with acromegaly is rare, and although 26 cases have been described in literature, pathological examinations have been undertaken in only three cases. This case was very rare and valuable because, by operating on her by the transsphenoidal route in spite of the sphenoidal sinus being affected with fibrous bone, we were able to confirm a chromophobe adenoma secreting both GH and PRL. We recognized that acromegaly with MCAS was endocrinologically, morphologically and immunohistologically the same as acromegaly without MCAS. Therefore, we concluded that acromegaly with MCAS is much the same as acromegaly without MCAS.
Document 6 (Title: Ovarian cancer): Several different cells from the mesenchyme can give rise to sex-cord or stromal tumors. These include fibroblasts and endocrine cells. The symptoms of a sex-cord or stromal ovarian tumor can differ from other types of ovarian cancer. Common signs and symptoms include ovarian torsion, hemorrhage from or rupture of the tumor, an abdominal mass, and hormonal disruption. In children, isosexual precocious pseudopuberty may occur with granulosa cell tumors since they produce estrogen. These tumors cause abnormalities in menstruation (excessive bleeding, infrequent menstruation, or no menstruation) or postmenopausal bleeding. Because these tumors produce estrogen, they can cause or occur at the same time as endometrial cancer or breast cancer. Other sex-cord/stromal tumors present with distinct symptoms. Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors cause virilization and excessive hair growth due to the production of testosterone and androstenedione, which can also cause Cushing's syndrome in rare cases.
Document 7 (Title: Peripheral Precocious Puberty -- Etiology -- Ovarian tumors): Ovarian tumors such as granulosa cell tumors, Sertoli/Leydig cell tumors, Leydig cell tumors, and gonadoblastoma can all result in precocious puberty. Granulosa cell tumor is the most common sex cord tumor in girls and is associated with excess estrogen production, which can lead to isosexual precocious puberty. On the other hand, gonadoblastoma, Leydig cell tumors, and Sertoli/Leydig tumors lead to excess androgen production and can present with contrasexual precocious puberty. [3] [2]
Document 8 (Title: Estrogen insensitivity syndrome): The patient had a small uterus, with an endometrial stripe that could not be clearly identified. At the age of 15 years, 5 months, her bone age was 11 or 12 years, and at the age of 17 years, 8 months, her bone age was 13.5 years. Her bone mass was lower than expected for her age, and levels of osteocalcin and C-terminal telopeptide were both elevated, suggesting an increased rate of bone turnover. She was 162.6 cm tall, and her growth velocity indicated a lack of estrogen-induced growth spurt at puberty. The patient had normal pubic hair development (Tanner stage IV) and severe facial acne, which could both be attributed to testosterone. Her ovarian pathology was attributed to the elevated levels of gonadotropins. In addition to her absence of breast development and areolar enlargement, the patient also appeared to show minimal widening of the hips and a lack of subcutaneous fat deposition, which is in accordance with the established role of estrogen and ERα in the development of

Ultrasound reveals a deep vein thrombosis in the left lower extremity; chest computed tomography scan confirms the presence of pulmonary emboli. Laboratory blood tests indicate elevated d-dimer levels. What therapy is indicated acutely? What are the long-term therapy options? How long should she be treated? Should this indi-vidual use oral contraceptives? A 25-year-old woman presents to the emergency depart-ment complaining of acute onset of shortness of breath and pleuritic pain. She had been in her usual state of health until 2 days prior when she noted that her left leg was swollen and red. Her only medication was oral contraceptives. Family history was significant for a history of “blood clots” in mul-tiple members of the maternal side of her family. Physical examination demonstrates an anxious woman with stable vital signs. The left
Document 10 (Title: Peripheral Precocious Puberty -- History and Physical -- Physical Exam): The most important part of the exam is to grade sexual maturity using the Tanner staging. Sexual maturity rating (SMR) is determined for pubic hair, breast and genitalia development, and graded on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 representing prepuberty and 5 representing adult development. While assessing breast development in girls, care should be taken to distinguish between irregular ductal breast tissue the subcutaneous tissue, which is smooth and soft. Similarly, palpation of the testes, measurement of stretched penile length, and testicular volume with an orchidometer should be done accurately. Penile dimensions disproportionately greater than testicular dimensions indicate peripheral precocious puberty due to adrenal pathology. Moderate symmetric enlargement of testes may indicate familial male limited precocious puberty or an HCG-secreting tumor. On the other hand, asymmetric testicular enlargement and a palpable testicular mass may indicate a Leydig cell tumor.
Document 11 (Title: First_Aid_Step2): Peripheral precocious puberty: Also called pseudo-precocious puberty. Results from nonhypothalamic GnRH production. Signs of estrogen excess (breast development and possibly vaginal bleeding) point to ovarian cysts or tumors. Signs of androgen excess (pubic and/or axillary hair, enlarged clitoris, acne, and/or ↑ body odor) suggest adrenal tumors or congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). First step: Obtain a radiograph of the wrist and hand to determine bone age. If bone age is within one year of chronological age, puberty has not started or has just recently begun. If bone age exceeds chronological age by > 2 years, puberty has been present for at least one year or is progressing rapidly. Next step: Conduct a GnRH agonist (leuprolide) stimulation test. Central precocious puberty: If LH response is , obtain a cranial MRI to look for CNS tumors. In girls 6–8 years of age with signs of precocious puberty, the incidence of CNS tumor is 2% in the absence of other CNS signs.
Document 12 (Title: Vaginal bleeding): Vaginal bleeding in the first week of life after birth is a common observation, and pediatricians typically discuss this with new mothers at the time of hospital discharge. During childhood, other possible causes include the presence of a foreign body in the vagina, trauma (either accidental or non accidental, i.e. child sexual abuse or molestation), urethral prolapse, vaginal infection (vaginitis), vulvar ulcers, vulvar skin conditions such as lichen sclerosus, and rarely, a tumor (benign or malignant vaginal tumors, or hormone-producing ovarian tumors). Hormonal causes include central precocious puberty, or peripheral precocious puberty (McCune-Albright syndrome), or primary hypothyroidism.
Document 13 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): A 21-year-old woman comes with her parents to discuss therapeutic options for her Crohn’s disease. She was diag-nosed with Crohn’s disease 2 years ago, and it involves her terminal ileum and proximal colon, as confirmed by colonoscopy and small bowel radiography. She was initially treated with mesalamine and budesonide with good response, but over the last 2 months, she has had a relapse of her symptoms. She is experiencing fatigue, cramping, abdominal pains, and nonbloody diarrhea up to 10 times daily, and she has had a 15-lb weight loss. She has no other significant medical or surgical his-tory. Her current medications are mesalamine 2.4 g/d and budesonide 9 mg/d. She appears thin and tired. Abdominal examination reveals tenderness without guarding in the right lower quadrant; no masses are palpable. On perianal examination, there is no tenderness, fissure, or fistula. Her laboratory data are notable for anemia and elevated C-reactive protein. What are the options for immediate
Document 14 (Title: Identifying and Addressing Bullying -- History and Physical): Another example is a teen immigrant girl with weight loss whose mother is concerned she does not like American school lunches. However, a thorough history and physical examination reveal she has been feeling isolated, and she reports that kids tease her incessantly about her lack of English language skills. No one will sit with her at lunchtime, so she avoids the cafeteria. She admits to mood swings, and the physical examination is notable for self-inflicted cutting scars on her forearms. The clinician must elicit further information to determine if she is at risk of suicidal ideation or behavior before developing a management plan and arranging follow-up.
Document 15 (Title: [Hypothalamic glioma with diencephalic syndrome and following precocious puberty--a case report].): A 1-year 11-month-old girl was admitted for losing her weight and gait disturbance. At 4 months of age, she began to become emaciated inspite of normal food intake. Physical and neurological examinations were normal except for a marked lack of subcutaneous fat, irritability and nystagmus. CT scans demonstrated a large tumor occupied in the third ventricle and marked dilatation of the lateral ventricles. Endocrinological studies revealed high levels of plasma growth hormone (GH) in contrast with normal levels of somatomedin-C. The basal value of GH returned to normal with a subnormal response to insulin subsequently after VP-shunt. Then, a pilocytic astrocytoma was partially resected with transcallosal approach. Postoperative course was uneventful and her growth rate returned to normal range. CT scans after radiation therapy of 49 Gy showed marked decrease in size of the tumor. At 3 years and 6 months of age, enlargement of her breast was pointed out although MRI indicated no enlargement of the tumor. Basal value of LH, FSH, E 1 and E 2 elevated and LHRH test showed over-response of LH and FSH. Other hypothalamic-pituitary functions were partially preserved. Case of precocious puberty following diencephalic syndrome associated to the hypothalamic and/or optochiasmatic glioma is quite rare in the previous literature. Mechanisms of diencephalic syndrome and following puberty are unclear. However, endocrinological and radiological findings observed in the present case suggest that hormonal disfunction might be due to the failure of inhibition on GH and LHRH secretion mechanism in the anterior hypothalamus.
