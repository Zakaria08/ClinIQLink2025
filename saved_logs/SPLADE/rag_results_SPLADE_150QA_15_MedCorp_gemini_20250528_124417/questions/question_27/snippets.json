        "content": "The pathogenesis remains unknown in the majority of patients with precocious puberty, and yet infrequently such causative cerebral lesions as hypothalamic hamartomas are associated with sexual precocity. We reported a rare case of suprasellar arachnoid cyst in an infant presenting with precocious puberty, which eventually disappeared after a cyst-peritoneal shunt. It was believed that the mass effect of the arachnoid cyst upon the hypothalamus was, at least in part, responsible for development of precocious puberty. The role of surgical decompression of the cyst was also discussed. A one-year-old girl was admitted to the hospital for evaluation of genital bleeding which had persisted on and off for two months. The height, 80cm, and the weight, 12.4kg, exceeded by far the two standard deviations from the mean level of the normal population. In addition she had the development of breast tissue as classified Tanner's Stage II, and both pubic and axillary hair. The bone age by skeletal survey of the hand was rated as 3 years. Endocrinological examination showed that serum levels of luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol had increased for her age, to levels equivalent to those for females at puberty. An LH-RH test revealed an excessive LH reaction. There were no definite neurological deficits. CT and MRI demonstrated the presence of a large arachnoid cyst involving the suprasellar region as well as the right middle and posterior fossa. After the patient underwent a cyst-peritoneal shunt, the cyst decreased in size and such symptoms as genital bleeding and breast growth disappeared. Serum levels of her LH and FSH also significantly decreased.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "content": "We report a case of a 47-year-old woman with McCune-Albright syndrome associated with unusual growth-hormone and prolactin hypersecretion. Acromegaly was suspected on clinical examination, and she was referred to us. She had no history of precocious puberty or pathological fracture. She was 154cm tall, weighing 62kg with so-called acromegalic facies. There were two lumps, one of which was on her right lateral forehead. The other on the right lower extremity seemed to be due to a bone deformity. Some brown pigmented macules with irregular borders were present on her lips and oral mucosa. Endocrine examination revealed elevated basal levels of plasma GH (54ng/ml) and PRL (36.2ng/ml), which paradoxically increased after injection of TRH. Plasma levels of these hormones did not change after LHRH test, and plasma GH level increased after GHRH test. A skull X-ray film showed a double floor of the sella turcia and hyperostotic formation of the right sphenoid bone. MRI and CT showed a tumor shadow in the right sella turcica. Bone roentogenography of the right fibula and tibia showed a large centrally expanding lesion with a ground-glass or cystic appearance and a thin cortex. The left fibula showed a similar lesion. We recognized similar findings in other bones which also showed abnormal accumulation in a radionuclide bone scan with 99mTc. On the basis of physical, endocrinological and roentogenographical examination, we diagnosed her as displaying McCune-Albright syndrome. We operated on her by transsphenoidal surgery and confirmed a functioning chromophobe adenoma which was removed during surgery. She has been free of GH and PRL hypersecretion since then. The pathology of the sphenoidal sinus affected with fibrous bone was in accordance with the findings of fibrous dysplasia. McCune-Albright syndrome (MCAS) is known as a syndrome characterized by polyostotic fibrous dysplasia and cutaneous pigmentation and multiple endocrinopathy. Its etiology is unknown. This syndrome with acromegaly is rare, and although 26 cases have been described in literature, pathological examinations have been undertaken in only three cases. This case was very rare and valuable because, by operating on her by the transsphenoidal route in spite of the sphenoidal sinus being affected with fibrous bone, we were able to confirm a chromophobe adenoma secreting both GH and PRL. We recognized that acromegaly with MCAS was endocrinologically, morphologically and immunohistologically the same as acromegaly without MCAS. Therefore, we concluded that acromegaly with MCAS is much the same as acromegaly without MCAS.",

        "contents": "Identifying and Addressing Bullying -- History and Physical. Another example is a teen immigrant girl with weight loss whose mother is concerned she does not like American school lunches. However, a\u00a0thorough history and physical examination reveal she has been feeling\u00a0isolated, and she reports that kids tease her incessantly about her lack of English language skills. No one will sit with her at lunchtime, so she avoids the cafeteria. She admits to mood swings, and the physical examination is notable for self-inflicted cutting scars on her forearms. The clinician must elicit further information to determine if she is at risk of suicidal ideation or behavior\u00a0before\u00a0developing a management plan and arranging follow-up."

        "content": "A 1-year 11-month-old girl was admitted for losing her weight and gait disturbance. At 4 months of age, she began to become emaciated inspite of normal food intake. Physical and neurological examinations were normal except for a marked lack of subcutaneous fat, irritability and nystagmus. CT scans demonstrated a large tumor occupied in the third ventricle and marked dilatation of the lateral ventricles. Endocrinological studies revealed high levels of plasma growth hormone (GH) in contrast with normal levels of somatomedin-C. The basal value of GH returned to normal with a subnormal response to insulin subsequently after VP-shunt. Then, a pilocytic astrocytoma was partially resected with transcallosal approach. Postoperative course was uneventful and her growth rate returned to normal range. CT scans after radiation therapy of 49 Gy showed marked decrease in size of the tumor. At 3 years and 6 months of age, enlargement of her breast was pointed out although MRI indicated no enlargement of the tumor. Basal value of LH, FSH, E 1 and E 2 elevated and LHRH test showed over-response of LH and FSH. Other hypothalamic-pituitary functions were partially preserved. Case of precocious puberty following diencephalic syndrome associated to the hypothalamic and/or optochiasmatic glioma is quite rare in the previous literature. Mechanisms of diencephalic syndrome and following puberty are unclear. However, endocrinological and radiological findings observed in the present case suggest that hormonal disfunction might be due to the failure of inhibition on GH and LHRH secretion mechanism in the anterior hypothalamus.",
