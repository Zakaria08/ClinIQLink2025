The discovery that a metabolite of tracazolate, desbutyltracazolate, was a weak inhibitor of [3H]FLU binding led to the synthesis of a series of potent anxiolytics.

Furthermore, ICI 190,622 appears less likely to potentiate the actions of ethanol than diazepam. ICI 190,622 is also a potent anticonvulsant (anti-metrazol ED50 = 1.1 mg/kg, PO) in rodents. Neurochemically, ICI 190,622 is similar to the benzodiazepine anxiolytics. In vitro, ICI 190,622 competitively inhibited [3H]FLU binding in cerebral cortex with an IC50 of 81 nM and was 4.3-fold more potent in the cerebellum (IC50 = 19 nM). This suggests a selectivity for the Type 1 benzodiazepine binding site. In contrast, diazepam showed similar affinities in both regions (cerebral cortex = 7 nM and cerebellum = 9 nM).

Typically, it is used as\u00a0a second-line agent behind selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) when a patient does not respond to or cannot tolerate the side effects of SSRIs. Buspirone has also been used as an augmentation agent to reduce SSRI's sexual side effects. Unlike benzodiazepines and barbiturates, there is no associated risk of physical dependence or withdrawal with buspirone use due to the lack of effects on gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors. However, buspirone has little efficacy as an acute anxiolytic as the clinical effect typically takes 2 to 4 weeks to achieve. It is as effective as benzodiazepine treatment for GAD. [3]",

        "title": "Ethyl loflazepate: a prodrug from the benzodiazepine series designed to dissociate anxiolytic and sedative activities.",
        "content": "Ethyl loflazepate (Victan) is an original 1,4-benzodiazepine (BZD) being used as a potent, nonsedative, minor tranquillizer. Ethyl loflazepate was designed to be a prodrug that would gradually release within the organism an active 1,4-BZD. It was hypothesized that this type of pharmacokinetic profile would dissociate anxiolytic from sedative activities. Previously published pharmacokinetic studies performed in rats, baboons and humans have confirmed that ethyl loflazepate gradually releases in the plasma an active 1,4-BZD, descarboxyloflazepate. In the present study, the activity of ethyl loflazepate and its main plasmatic metabolites were examined in rodent models predictive of anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, myorelaxant and sedative properties. The activities of ethyl loflazepate and its metabolites were compared to those of reference BZDs: diazepam, bromazepam, nitrazepam, flunitrazepam, lorazepam, clorazepate. Ethyl loflazepate and its metabolites revealed the typical profile of activity of minor tranquillizers. The activity of ethyl loflazepate was long-lasting. The overall anxiolytic potency of ethyl loflazepate was similar to that of diazepam but ethyl loflazepate appeared to be less sedative than diazepam. Thus in the approach-avoidance conflict procedure in rats the threshold anxiolytic doses were 1 and 2 mg/kg i.p. for ethyl loflazepate and diazepam, respectively, whereas the threshold sedative doses were 16 and 8 mg/kg i.p., respectively. In vitro ethyl loflazepate exhibited a weak affinity for the BZD receptor site. In vivo ethyl loflazepate displaced [3H]-flunitrazepam from mice brain membranes with a potency comparable to that of lorazepam. In vitro, descarboxyloflazepate, the main plasmatic metabolites of ethyl loflazepate, revealed a 4-fold greater affinity for the BZD receptor than diazepam.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
