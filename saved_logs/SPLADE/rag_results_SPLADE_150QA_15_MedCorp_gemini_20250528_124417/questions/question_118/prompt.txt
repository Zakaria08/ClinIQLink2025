Document 1 (Title: Diazepam -- Indications): Diazepam is an anxiolytic benzodiazepine, first patented and marketed in the United States in 1963. It is a fast-acting, long-lasting benzodiazepine commonly used to treat anxiety disorders and alcohol detoxification, acute recurrent seizures, severe muscle spasms, and spasticity associated with neurologic disorders. In acute alcohol withdrawal, diazepam is useful for symptomatic relief of agitation, tremor, alcoholic hallucinosis, and acute delirium tremens. [1] Benzodiazepines have largely replaced barbiturates in treating anxiety and sleep disorders because of their improved safety profile, fewer side effects, and flumazenil(antagonist) availability that can reverse oversedation in cases of benzodiazepine intoxication.

Document 2 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): TABLE 22–1 Pharmacokinetic properties of some benzodiazepines and newer hypnotics in humans. 1Time to peak blood level. 2Includes half-lives of major metabolites. because the elimination half-life of the parent drug may have little relation to the time course of pharmacologic effects. Benzodiazepines for which the parent drug or active metabolites have long half-lives are more likely to cause cumulative effects with multiple doses. Cumulative and residual effects such as excessive drowsiness appear to be less of a problem with such drugs as estazolam, oxazepam, and lorazepam, which have relatively short half-lives and are metabolized directly to inactive glucuronides. Some pharmacokinetic properties of selected benzodiazepines and newer hypnotics are listed in Table 22–1. The metabolism of several commonly used benzodiazepines including diazepam, midazolam, and triazolam is affected by inhibitors and inducers of hepatic P450 isozymes (see Chapter 4).
Document 3 (Title: Preclinical studies with pyrazolopyridine non-benzodiazepine anxiolytics: ICI 190,622.): Tracazolate is a pyrazolopyridine anxiolytic that enhances the binding of [3H]-flunitrazepam [( 3H]FLU) to brain tissue. The discovery that a metabolite of tracazolate, desbutyltracazolate, was a weak inhibitor of [3H]FLU binding led to the synthesis of a series of potent anxiolytics. From this series, ICI 190,622 emerged as a viable drug candidate, being a potent anxiolytic in rats and monkeys. This anxiolytic agent appears to produce only minimal sedation. Furthermore, ICI 190,622 appears less likely to potentiate the actions of ethanol than diazepam. ICI 190,622 is also a potent anticonvulsant (anti-metrazol ED50 = 1.1 mg/kg, PO) in rodents. Neurochemically, ICI 190,622 is similar to the benzodiazepine anxiolytics. In vitro, ICI 190,622 competitively inhibited [3H]FLU binding in cerebral cortex with an IC50 of 81 nM and was 4.3-fold more potent in the cerebellum (IC50 = 19 nM). This suggests a selectivity for the Type 1 benzodiazepine binding site. In contrast, diazepam showed similar affinities in both regions (cerebral cortex = 7 nM and cerebellum = 9 nM). Following oral administration, ICI 190,622 displaced [3H]FLU binding from cerebellar membranes more potently than diazepam (ED50 = 3 and 6 mg/kg, respectively, 1 hour after administration). Thus, ICI 190,622 should be an effective anxiolytic with significant advantages over benzodiazepines.
Document 4 (Title: Fludiazepam): Fludiazepam, marketed under the brand name Erispan (エリスパン) is a potent benzodiazepine and 2ʹ-fluoro derivative of diazepam, originally developed by Hoffman-La Roche in the 1960s. It is marketed in Japan and Taiwan. It exerts its pharmacological properties via enhancement of GABAergic inhibition. Fludiazepam has 4 times more binding affinity for benzodiazepine receptors than diazepam. It possesses anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, sedative, hypnotic and skeletal muscle relaxant properties. Fludiazepam has been used recreationally.

Document 5 (Title: Differential effects of the 1,4 and 1,5 benzodiazepines on performance in healthy man.): 1 The immediate and residual effects on performance of benzodiazepines differ, and the differences are important in the use of these drugs. 2. Diazepam and its hydroxylated metabolites, temazepam and oxazepam, each possess hypnotic activity, and have effects on performance limited to the sleep period. The demethylated metabolite of diazepam, nordiazepam, and its precursor, potassium clorazepate, which also possess hypnotic activity, have a longer duration of action, although the next day anxiolytic effect is accompanied by only minimal effects on performance. The 1.5 benzodiazepine, clobazam, seems to have minimal immediate effects on performance. 3 Diazepam and its hydroxylated metabolites, temazepam and oxazepam, would be useful in the management of insomnia without psychopathology in those cases in which residual effects on performance must be avoided. Nordiazepam and potassium clorazepate would be appropriate for insomnia secondary to day-time anxiety, and clobazam may be useful as a day-time anxiolytic. 4 It is emphasized that more work needs to be carried out on the effects of anxiolytics on performance before one can be certain that ingestion during the day would be without any deleterious effects on skilled work.
Document 6 (Title: Metaclazepam): Metaclazepam (marketed under the brand name Talis) is a drug which is a benzodiazepine derivative. It is a relatively selective anxiolytic with less sedative or muscle relaxant properties than other benzodiazepines such as diazepam or bromazepam. It has an active metabolite N-desmethylmetaclazepam, which is the main metabolite of metaclazepam. There is no significant difference in metabolism between younger and older individuals. Metaclazepam is slightly more effective as an anxiolytic than bromazepam, or diazepam, with a 15 mg dose of metaclazepam equivalent to 4 mg of bromazepam. Metaclazepam can interact with alcohol producing additive sedative-hypnotic effects. Fatigue is a common side effect from metaclazepam at high doses. Small amounts of metaclazepam as well as its metabolites enter into human breast milk.

Document 7 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Flunitrazepam (Rohypnol) is a benzodiazepine derivative primarily used to treat insomnia, but it has significant abuse potential because of its strong hypnotic, anxiolytic, and amnesia-producing effects. It is a club drug commonly referred to as a “date-rape drug” or “roofies.” The drug enhances GABAA receptor activity, and overdose can be treated with flumazenil, a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist. Flunitrazepam is typically used orally but can be snorted or injected. Concomitant use of alcohol or opioids is common, and this enhances the sedative and hypnotic effects of flunitrazepam and also the risk of motor vehicle accidents. Overdose can produce life-threatening respiratory depression and coma. Abrupt cessation after chronic use may result in a benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome consisting of anxiety, insomnia, disordered thinking, and seizures.
Document 8 (Title: Pinazepam): Pinazepam differs from other benzodiazepines in that it has a propargyl group at the N-1 position of the benzodiazepine structure. It is less toxic than diazepam and in animal studies it appears to produce anxiolytic and anti-agitation properties with limited hypnotic and motor coordination impairing properties. Pinazepam is rapidly absorbed after oral administration. The main active metabolites of pinazepam are depropargylpinazepam (N-desmethyldiazepam, nordazepam) and oxazepam. In humans pinazepam acts as a pure anxiolytic agent in that it does not possess to any significant degree the other pharmacological characteristics of benzodiazepines. Its lack of intellectual, motor and hypnotic impairing effects makes it more appropriate than other benzodiazepines for day time use. The elimination half-life is longer in the elderly.

Document 9 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Adverse effects of benzodiazepines generally parallel their relative half-lives. Longer-acting agents, such as diazepam, chlordiazepoxide, flurazepam, and clonazepam, tend to accumulate active metabolites, with resultant sedation, impairment of cognition, and poor psychomotor performance. Shorter-acting compounds, such as alprazolam, lorazepam, and oxazepam, can produce daytime anxiety, early morning insomnia, and, with discontinuation, rebound anxiety and insomnia. Although patients develop tolerance to the sedative effects of benzodiazepines, they are less likely to habituate to the adverse psychomotor effects. Withdrawal from the longer half-life benzodiazepines can be accomplished through gradual, stepwise dose reduction (by 10% every 1–2 weeks) over 6–12 weeks. It is usually more difficult to taper patients off shorter-acting benzodiazepines. Physicians may need to switch the patient to a benzodiazepine with a longer half-life or use an
Document 10 (Title: Imidazenil): Imidazenil is an experimental anxiolytic drug which is derived from the benzodiazepine family, and is most closely related to other imidazobenzodiazepines such as midazolam, flumazenil, and bretazenil. Imidazenil is a highly potent benzodiazepine receptor partial agonist with an unusual profile of effects, producing some of the effects associated with normal benzodiazepines such as anticonvulsant and anxiolytic effects, yet without any notable sedative or amnestic effects. In fact, imidazenil blocks the sedative effects of diazepam, yet without lowering the convulsion threshold, and so potentially could be a more flexible antidote than the antagonist flumazenil which is commonly used to treat benzodiazepine overdose at present.
Document 11 (Title: Benzodiazepine-induced hyperphagia in the nondeprived rat: comparisons with CL 218,872, zopiclone, tracazolate and phenobarbital.): Nondeprived male rats were familiarized with 30 min daily access to a highly palatable diet. Clonazepam, midazolam and chlordiazepoxide each produced significant dose-dependent increases in food consumption. Clonazepam was the most potent, and a significant hyperphagic effect was detected following 0.078 mg/kg (IP). Amongst novel non-benzodiazepine anxiolytics, zopiclone and CL 218,872 also produced significant increases in food intake. The smallest doses to produce significant hyperphagia for these two drugs were 10.0 and 2.5 mg/kg (IP) respectively. In contrast, tracazolate caused only a reduction in feeding, evident at 20 and 40 mg/kg (IP). Previous reports indicate that although benzodiazepines, zopiclone and CL 218,872 displace [3H] flunitrazepam binding in rat cerebral cortex preparations, tracazolate enhances the binding. Our results are consistent with the drug-induced hyperphagia depending upon agonist actions at high-affinity benzodiazepine sites. They also provide pharmacological evidence for a dissociation between hyperphagic and anxiolytic drug effects. Phenobarbital (2.5-40.0 mg/kg), like the benzodiazepines, produced a strong stimulation of food intake, indicating that drug action at an alternative site in the benzodiazepine receptor-GABA receptor-chloride channel complex can also lead to hyperphagia.

Document 13 (Title: Zopiclone): Pharmacology The therapeutic pharmacological properties of zopiclone include hypnotic, anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, and myorelaxant properties. Zopiclone and benzodiazepines bind to the same sites on GABAA receptors, causing an enhancement of the actions of GABA to produce the therapeutic and adverse effects of zopiclone. The metabolite of zopiclone called desmethylzopiclone is also pharmacologically active, although it has predominately anxiolytic properties. One study found some slight selectivity for zopiclone on α1 and α5 subunits, although it is regarded as being unselective in its binding to GABAA receptors containing α1, α2, α3, and α5 subunits. Desmethylzopiclone has been found to have partial agonist properties, unlike the parent drug zopiclone, which is a full agonist. The mechanism of action of zopiclone is similar to benzodiazepines, with similar effects on locomotor activity and on dopamine and serotonin turnover.
Document 14 (Title: Buspirone -- Indications): United States Food and Drug Administration-Approved Indication: Management of anxiety disorders or the short-term relief of anxiety symptoms. The efficacy of buspirone has been demonstrated in controlled clinical trials of outpatients whose diagnosis corresponds to generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). [2] Buspirone's use is primarily for treating GAD. Typically, it is used as a second-line agent behind selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) when a patient does not respond to or cannot tolerate the side effects of SSRIs. Buspirone has also been used as an augmentation agent to reduce SSRI's sexual side effects. Unlike benzodiazepines and barbiturates, there is no associated risk of physical dependence or withdrawal with buspirone use due to the lack of effects on gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors. However, buspirone has little efficacy as an acute anxiolytic as the clinical effect typically takes 2 to 4 weeks to achieve. It is as effective as benzodiazepine treatment for GAD. [3]
Document 15 (Title: Ethyl loflazepate: a prodrug from the benzodiazepine series designed to dissociate anxiolytic and sedative activities.): Ethyl loflazepate (Victan) is an original 1,4-benzodiazepine (BZD) being used as a potent, nonsedative, minor tranquillizer. Ethyl loflazepate was designed to be a prodrug that would gradually release within the organism an active 1,4-BZD. It was hypothesized that this type of pharmacokinetic profile would dissociate anxiolytic from sedative activities. Previously published pharmacokinetic studies performed in rats, baboons and humans have confirmed that ethyl loflazepate gradually releases in the plasma an active 1,4-BZD, descarboxyloflazepate. In the present study, the activity of ethyl loflazepate and its main plasmatic metabolites were examined in rodent models predictive of anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, myorelaxant and sedative properties. The activities of ethyl loflazepate and its metabolites were compared to those of reference BZDs: diazepam, bromazepam, nitrazepam, flunitrazepam, lorazepam, clorazepate. Ethyl loflazepate and its metabolites revealed the typical profile of activity of minor tranquillizers. The activity of ethyl loflazepate was long-lasting. The overall anxiolytic potency of ethyl loflazepate was similar to that of diazepam but ethyl loflazepate appeared to be less sedative than diazepam. Thus in the approach-avoidance conflict procedure in rats the threshold anxiolytic doses were 1 and 2 mg/kg i.p. for ethyl loflazepate and diazepam, respectively, whereas the threshold sedative doses were 16 and 8 mg/kg i.p., respectively. In vitro ethyl loflazepate exhibited a weak affinity for the BZD receptor site. In vivo ethyl loflazepate displaced [3H]-flunitrazepam from mice brain membranes with a potency comparable to that of lorazepam. In vitro, descarboxyloflazepate, the main plasmatic metabolites of ethyl loflazepate, revealed a 4-fold greater affinity for the BZD receptor than diazepam.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
