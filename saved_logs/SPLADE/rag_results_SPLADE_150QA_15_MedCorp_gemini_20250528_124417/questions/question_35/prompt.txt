Document 1 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): Philip J. Rosenthal, MD A 5-year-old American girl presents with a 1-week history of intermittent chills, fever, and sweats. She had returned home 2 weeks earlier after leaving the USA for the first time to spend 3 weeks with her grandparents in Nigeria. She received all standard childhood immunizations, but no additional treat-ment before travel, since her parents have returned to their native Nigeria frequently without medical consequences. Three days ago, the child was seen in an outpatient clinic and diagnosed with a viral syndrome. Examination reveals a lethargic child, with a temperature of 39.8°C (103.6°F) and splenomegaly. She has no skin rash or lymphadenopathy. Ini-tial laboratory studies are remarkable for hematocrit 29.8%, platelets 45,000/mm3, creatinine 2.5 mg/dL (220 μmol/L), and mildly elevated bilirubin and transaminases. A blood smear shows ring forms of Plasmodium falciparum at 1.5% parasit-emia. What treatment should be started?
Document 2 (Title: Root Cause Analysis and Medical Error Prevention -- Function -- Case example 1): A 42-year-old primigravida woman at 34 weeks gestation was brought to the obstetric emergency department at midnight with complaints of severe headache, blurry vision, and right upper quadrant pain for the last 5 to 6 hours. She noted lower extremity edema and facial swelling that was gradually increasing. She has gestational hypertension and, 1 week ago, was prescribed labetalol 200 mg twice a day. On initial presentation, her blood pressure was 190/110 mm Hg on 2 separate occasions, 5 minutes apart. She had gained 2 kilograms since her last antenatal checkup in the clinic a week ago. The patient was diagnosed with severe preeclampsia. The senior obstetric resident ordered a loading dose of magnesium sulfate to prevent imminent seizure. The hospital protocol used an intravenous (IV) and intramuscular (IM) regimen where the patient received a 4 g IV bolus and a 10 g IM dose administered as 5 g in each buttock. The senior resident gave verbal orders for magnesium sulfate administration to the junior resident, who verbally communicated the order to the nurse.

Document 4 (Title: A case of human ehrlichiosis acquired in Mali: clinical and laboratory findings.): We report on the clinical, epidemiologic, and laboratory characteristics of the first case of human ehrlichiosis acquired outside the United States caused by an Ehrlichia sp. other than E. sennetsu. The patient, a 24-year-old woman, presumably acquired the infection in Mali in northern Africa; the diagnosis was made when she returned to North America. The patient reported a fever and diarrhea a week before she left Mali; the diarrhea resolved, but the fever and chills continued. She also reported intermittent tingling in both hands and feet and muscle discomfort. Her temperature was 37.8 degrees C and her pulse rate was 100 per minute. She had two erythematous maculopapules (0.5 x 0.7 mm) on her thigh and ankle that resembled infected insect bites. Her hemoglobin level was 148 g/l with normal indices, and her white blood cell count was 10, 500/mm3 with many atypical lymphocytes and platelets. This report is intended to increase physicians' awareness of ehrlichiosis in foreign travelers and other patients, and suggests the need for further research to determine the prevalence and distribution of this disease.
Document 5 (Title: Acute pancreatitis): At admission age in years > 55 years white blood cell count > 16000 cells/mm3 blood glucose > 11.1 mmol/L (> 200 mg/dL) serum AST > 250 IU/L serum LDH > 350 IU/L At 48 hours Calcium (serum calcium < 2.0 mmol/L (< 8.0 mg/dL) Hematocrit fall >10% Oxygen (hypoxemia PO2 < 60 mmHg) BUN increased by 1.8 or more mmol/L (5 or more mg/dL) after IV fluid hydration Base deficit (negative base excess) > 4 mEq/L Sequestration of fluids > 6 L The criteria for point assignment is that a certain breakpoint be met at any time during that 48 hour period, so that in some situations it can be calculated shortly after admission. It is applicable to both gallstone and alcoholic pancreatitis. Alternatively, pancreatitis can be diagnosed by meeting any of the following:[2] Alternative Ranson score Ranson's score of ≥ 8 Organ failure Substantial pancreatic necrosis (at least 30% glandular necrosis according to contrast-enhanced CT)
Document 6 (Title: [Successful treatment of levodopa-induced neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in a patient with Parkinson's disease].): A 77-year-old woman with a 9 years history of Parkinson's disease was admitted to our hospital because of high fever, disturbance of consciousness, increased muscular rigidity and abnormal involuntary movements. She was continuously treated with levodopa + carbidopa (Menesit) 300 mg and amantadine 150 mg every day until admission. On admission, the pulse rate was 102 per minute, blood pressure 90/40 mmHg, body temperature 40.9 degrees C, and bloody stool was noticed. On laboratory examination, erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 6 mm/h, thrombocytes 8.1 X 10(4)/microliters, fibrinogen 91 mg/dl, FDP 40 mg/ml, suggesting DIC. According to her biochemical examination, serum GOT (167 u), GPT (119 u), CPK (847 IU/l), BUN (53.9 mg/dl) and myoglobin (10,370 ng/ml) were increased. These laboratory data indicated that she was suffering from neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). On diagnosis of NMS associated with DIC, she was treated with dantrolene and FUT-175. Dantrolene was effective on the elevated COK level and FUT-175 was effective on the DIC, and symptoms of NMS and DIC were completely improved after a period of 14 days. Patients with Parkinson's disease have been suspected to have a low incidence of DIC, and this may be the first case report on successful treatment of levodopa-induced NMS with DIC in the patient with Parkinson's disease.
Document 7 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): Her social history is significant for alcohol use (three to four glasses of wine/night). Her vital signs include the following: temperature 99.8°F, blood pressure 132/64 mm Hg, pulse 78 bpm, and respiratory rate 15/min. On physical examination, she had left upper abdominal tenderness with evidence of hepatomegaly and mild scleral icterus. Laboratory data revealed the following: alanine aminotransferase, 527 IU/L (normal 10–35 IU/L); aspartate aminotransferase, 425 IU/L (normal < 35 IU/L); and bilirubin, 2.9 mg/dL (normal 0.1–0.3 mg/dL). What medications do OTC cold and flu preparations typically contain? Which of the OTC medications might have contrib-uted to the patient’s current symptoms? KH, a 55-year-old woman, presents to the emergency department with nausea, vomiting, and complaints of new-onset flu symptoms over the past several days. Her past medical history is significant for allergic rhinitis and chronic lower back pain secondary to a work-related fall 2 years ago. Her

Document 9 (Title: Case Study: 33-Year-Old Female Presents with Chronic SOB and Cough (Archived) -- Case Presentation): History of Present Illness: A 33-year-old white female presents after admission to the general medical/surgical hospital ward with a chief complaint of shortness of breath on exertion. She reports that she was seen for similar symptoms previously at her primary care physician’s office six months ago. At that time, she was diagnosed with acute bronchitis and treated with bronchodilators, empiric antibiotics, and a short course oral steroid taper. This management did not improve her symptoms, and she has gradually worsened over six months. She reports a 20-pound (9 kg) intentional weight loss over the past year. She denies camping, spelunking, or hunting activities. She denies any sick contacts. A brief review of systems is negative for fever, night sweats, palpitations, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, neural sensation changes, muscular changes, and increased bruising or bleeding. She admits a cough, shortness of breath, and shortness of breath on exertion.

Document 11 (Title: Community-acquired pneumonia): Hospitalization Some CAP patients require intensive care, with clinical prediction rules such as the pneumonia severity index and CURB-65 guiding the decision whether or not to hospitalize. Factors increasing the need for hospitalization include: Age greater than 65 Underlying chronic illnesses Respiratory rate greater than 30 per minute Systolic blood pressure less than 90 mmHg Heart rate greater than 125 per minute Temperature below 35 or over 40 °C Confusion Evidence of infection outside the lung Laboratory results indicating hospitalization include: Arterial oxygen tension less than 60 mm Hg Carbon dioxide over 50 mmHg or pH under 7.35 while breathing room air Hematocrit under 30 percent Creatinine over 1.2 mg/dl or blood urea nitrogen over 20 mg/dl White-blood-cell count under 4 × 10^9/L or over 30 × 10^9/L Neutrophil count under 1 x 10^9/L
Document 12 (Title: [A case of mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) associated with transverse myelitis responding to pulse therapy].): A 42-year-old female was admitted to our hospital on October 1, 1990 because of one week history of back pain, weakness of her right lower extremity and sensory disturbance of her left lower extremity. Physical examination revealed swollen hands, Raynaud's phenomenon, sclerodactyly and heliotrope rash. The body temperature was 37.0 degrees C. Neurological findings included weakness in the right lower extremity, left hypalgesia and thermohypesthesia below Th4, hyperreflexia on the right lower extremity and right extensive plantar response. Laboratory data showed leucopenia (3,700/mm3) and hypergammaglobulinemia. Serological examination revealed antinuclear antibodies with a titer of 1:5120 (speckled pattern) and anti-RNP antibody with a titer of 1:32. Neither anti-DNA antibody nor anti-Sm antibody were detected. Serum C3 and C4 were normal. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) contained mononuclear cells of 5/mm3, protein 29 mg/dl and glucose 56 mg/dl. Queckenstedt test was negative. Treatment with prednisolone 60 mg daily was started. On the 8th day of therapy, she complained of a burning sensation in the back, then paraplegia and urinary retention developed. MRI examination showed a high intensity area of the spinal cord at the right Th4 on T2-weighted images. Next day the treatment with 1000-mg intravenous daily pulse of methylprednisolone for 3 days was started, followed by prednisolone 40 mg daily. After this pulse therapy, the CSF contained mononuclear cells of 52/mm3, protein 34 mg/dl, glucose 67 mg/dl and IgG 7.6 mg/dl. Her neurological manifestation gradually improved and at six weeks after the pulse therapy neurological examination revealed no abnormality except for painful tonic spasm. Prednisolone was slowly tapered to 15 mg daily.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Document 13 (Title: Blood urea nitrogen): Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is a medical test that measures the amount of urea nitrogen found in blood. The liver produces urea in the urea cycle as a waste product of the digestion of protein. Normal human adult blood should contain 6 to 20 mg/dL (2.1 to 7.1 mmol/L) of urea nitrogen. Individual laboratories will have different reference ranges as the assay used can vary between laboratories. The test is used to detect renal problems. It is not considered as reliable as creatinine or BUN/creatinine ratio blood studies. Interpretation BUN is an indication of renal (kidney) health. The normal range is 2.1–7.1 mmol/L or 6–20 mg/dL. The main causes of an increase in BUN are: high protein diet, decrease in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (suggestive of kidney failure), decrease in blood volume (hypovolemia), congestive heart failure, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, fever, rapid cell destruction from infections, athletic activity, excessive muscle breakdown, and increased catabolism.
Document 14 (Title: [A case of miliary tuberculosis associated with acute respiratory failure during pregnancy].): A case of miliary tuberculosis associated with acute respiratory failure during pregnancy was reported. A 39-year-old, 29-week pregnant woman was admitted to our hospital with complaints of nonproductive cough and fever on June 12. On admission, her temperature was 38.2 degrees C; pulse rate was 90/min., and blood pressure was 120/76 mmHg. Physical examination revealed moist rales at right lung basis. Chest X-ray showed small nodular infiltrates in right lower lung field. Laboratory data revealed positive CRP, accelerated ESR and increased level of alpha 2-globulin. The number of T-cells was markedly decreased (14/mm3). The PPD skin test was negative, and the sputum smears for acid-fast bacilli were negative. Suspected of bacterial or viral pneumonia, the patient was treated with antibiotics (CPM, EM and CAZ), which had no effects for her. On June 16, the Chest X-ray showed infiltrates throughout bilateral lung fields, and the patient became increasingly dyspneic. On June 18, the results of arterial blood gas, analysis under room air were: PaO2 26.7 Torr, PaCO2 29.0 Torr, pH 7.505. Because of severe hypoxemia, she was intubated and placed on a volume-cycled respirator. Hydrocortisone (1000 mg, daily) was added to treatment because ARDS was suspected. Since the smears of tracheobronchial secretions showed acid-fast bacilli on June 24, she was diagnosed to have miliary tuberculosis. Then the intensive therapy with antituberculosis drugs (isoniazid 400 mg, rifampicin 450 mg, and streptomycin 1g, daily) was started. The non specific antibiotics were discontinued; hydrocortisone was tapered and stopped. The next week, she became afebrile and hypoxemia steadily improved.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Document 15 (Title: Prophylactic subcutaneous heparin therapy as a cause of bilateral adrenal hemorrhage.): A 63-year-old white woman was admitted to the hospital for bilateral total knee arthroplasty. She was given prophylactic subcutaneous heparin therapy postoperatively. Three days later, she had a brief hypotensive episode and an unexplained drop in hemoglobin level. Seven days postoperatively, she became confused and disoriented while complaining of pain in her right side and, later, under her left breast. She also had nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and a vague feeling of "illness." Her condition deteriorated progressively, with blood pressure falling to 65/40 mm Hg and a temperature of 39.7 degrees C. Blood, urine, and cerebrospinal-fluid culture samples showed no evidence of infection. A diagnosis of acute adrenal insufficiency was made. Following corticosteroid therapy, the patient's condition improved markedly. Of interest in our patient was that she had had no antecedent hypotension, sepsis, fever, or surgical complications. Acute adrenal hemorrhage is often overlooked because the symptoms are attributed to other conditions, especially to sepsis. Acute adrenal hemorrhage should be suspected in any stressed patient in whom an abrupt deterioration associated with back or abdominal pain, hypotension, and unexplained fever are noted. Suspicion should be raised regarding those patients who are receiving anticoagulant therapy (including subcutaneous heparin prophylaxis) at the time of deterioration. With increased awareness, more cases of acute bilateral adrenal hemorrhage and subsequent adrenal insufficiency can be recognized ante mortem and treated.
