Document 1 (Title: Sirtex): Results from the largest most comprehensive study to date evaluating SIRT in liver metastases from colorectal cancer were presented at ASCO in 2012, ASCO-GI 2013 and ASCO in 2014. The various subsets of the MORE study, led by Andrew S. Kennedy M.D. Physician in Chief, Radiation Oncology Sarah Cannon Research Institute Nashville Tenn., have demonstrated safety and efficacy as well as the same in treating the elderly. The most recent set of data presented at ASCO in 2014 documented the ability to predict success of SIRT using standard laboratory tests prior to treatment. In addition, the global SIRFLOX study which completed patient recruitment in 2013 will evaluate SIR-Spheres microspheres a first-line treatment for colorectal liver metastases.
Document 2 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): Systemic che-motherapy is recommended in almost all cases of distant spread. However, unlike many other malignancies, highly selected patients with isolated, resectable metastases may benefit from resection (metastasectomy). The most common site of metasta-sis is the liver. Of patients with systemic disease, approximately 15% will have metastases limited to the liver. Of these, 20% are potentially resectable for cure. Survival is improved in these patients (20–40% 5-year survival) when compared to patients who do not undergo resection. Hepatic resection of synchronous metastases from colorectal carcinoma may be performed as a combined procedure or in two stages. The second most com-mon site of metastasis is the lung, occurring in approximately 20% of patients with colorectal carcinoma. Although very few of these patients will be potentially resectable, among those who are (about 1–2% of all colorectal cancer patients), long-term survival benefit is approximately 30% to 40%. There are
Document 3 (Title: Liver Metastasis -- Epidemiology): Nearly 20% to 25% of patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer will develop liver metastases, with 15% to 25% of these cases presenting with synchronous disease. [4] [5] The most common metastases originated from colorectal primaries, followed by pancreatic and breast. In females less than 50 years of age, metastatic hepatic disease originated more frequently from the breast. Metastatic liver disease in those older than 70 years old was from a gastrointestinal source; 92% of metastatic hepatic lesions were carcinomas. Of these carcinoma lesions, 75% of them were adenocarcinomas. [3] Overall, histologically confirmed hepatic metastases were more common in males than females, and most patients were older than 50 years of age.
Document 4 (Title: [Prognosis in synchronous liver metastasis from colorectal cancer. A multicenter study of patients with cancer of the rectum and cancer of the rectosigmoid colon].): A prospective investigation of 188 patients with cancer of the rectum and rectosigmoid colon with synchronous liver metastases is described. The mean survival time for 183 patients who did not receive any treatment for the liver metastases was six months and only one survived for longer than 37 months. After extirpation of the primary tumour, the most significant prognostic factors were etrahepatic metastases, enlarged liver on account of metastases and more than three liver metastases. Serum basic phosphatases had the greatest significance among a series of laboratory tests. In the sub-groups with the best possible prognoses, the mean survival time was 12 months. 25% five-year survival has been described in the literature following resection of the liver in patients with a maximum of three metastases, no other metastases and age under 70 years. Provided this holds true, liver surgery will be a therapeutic possibility in at least 100 patients per annum in Denmark with synchronous liver metastases and 25 of these will be cured. This figure requires an improved programme for the diagnosis of synchronous liver metastases than at present and the same high frequency of extirpation of the primary colorectal cancer on a national basis which was achieved in the present material.
Document 5 (Title: Localized Prostate Cancer -- Introduction): Prostate cancer is a disease of men. An estimated 1.2 million cases were diagnosed in 2018, making it the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in men worldwide. It was also the most common cancer in men aged over 55. In the same year, prostate cancer was the third most common cause of cancer-related death in men in North America and Europe. From a global perspective, deaths from liver, stomach, and esophageal cancer meant that it ranked sixth for cancer deaths internationally. [1]

Document 7 (Title: Resection of liver metastases in colorectal cancer--competitive analysis of treatment results in synchronous versus metachronous metastases.): One hundred and twenty-two patients underwent liver resection for metastases of colorectal cancer within 8 years. Seventy-four of them were treated for metachronous metastases detected in a median of 18 months after resection of the primary tumor. In another 48 patients the metastases were resected at the same time as the primary cancer. Both groups were analysed for disease-free and overall survival, and for peri-operative morbidity. However, neither the type of hepatic resection nor peri-operative morbidity showed relevant differences in the groups, except for the metachronous group, the only group in which operative mortality occurred (6.7%). Survival was not significantly different, being 32 months in the metachronous and 24 months in the synchronous groups (P = 0.051). However, disease-free survival showed significant differences; no patient in the synchronous group experienced a recurrence-free interval of more than 3 years. The median time interval until diagnosis of a recurrence was 10 months after resection of metachronous metastases, but only 6 months in the synchronous group (P = 0.018). The pattern of recurrence showed a much higher proportion of patients with disseminated disease in the synchronous group (95% vs 42%). Therefore, liver resection in synchronous colorectal metastases should be handled very restrictively and adjuvant treatment strategies considered in the future.
Document 8 (Title: Surgical management of patients with primary operable colorectal cancer and synchronous liver metastases.): The surgical results were analyzed of 217 patients who had undergone operation for primary colorectal cancer and were found to have synchronous liver metastases. It is recommended that patients with primary operable colorectal cancer who are found to have synchronous liver metastases should at least have an adequate resection of the primary lesion. If the primary lesion is resectable for cure and there are solitary hepatic metastases, then excision of these seems warranted. In most cases this can be accomplished by simple excision or wedge resection, although occasional cases may require lobectomy.
Document 9 (Title: Nuclear Medicine PET/CT Gastrointestinal Assessment, Protocols, and Interpretation -- Indications): For colorectal cancers, PET/CT is indicated for staging disease with synchronous metastases at presentation, such as pulmonary and liver lesions. Other indications include restaging in patients with recurrence, assessing treatment response, detecting recurrence in the presence of rising tumor markers, and evaluating clinical suspicion of recurrence when other imaging modalities have normal or equivocal results. Posttreatment, PET/CT may also be used to evaluate indeterminate presacral masses.
Document 10 (Title: C-C chemokine receptor type 6): Clinical significance CCR6 has a function in development and metastatic spread of gastrointestinal malignancies. Expression of CCR6 was found to be up-regulated in colorectal cancer. Many patients with colorectal cancer have liver metastases. Colorectal carcinoma cells express CCR6 and CCL20. High level of CCL20 in liver chemoattract colorectal carcinoma cells and cause metastases in liver. Novel research has identified a microRNA that is able to downregulate CCR6 in cancer cell lines. CCR6 has been associated with Crohn's disease. References External links Further reading Chemokine receptors Clusters of differentiation
Document 11 (Title: Value of follow-up in the management of recurrent colorectal cancer.): The purpose of this article was to study the effectiveness of a prospective follow-up programme in patients after curative surgery for colorectal cancer. Of the initial 151 selected patients, 61 (40%) developed a recurrence in whom only six cases (10%) of potentially curable recurrent lesions were detected. The first clues to recurrence in the 61 patients were history or physical examination in 49%, a rising CEA in 29% and a positive imaging finding in 10%, being difficult to decide which test first signalled a recurrent cancer in an additional 11%. Endoscopy and CEA determinations were the most rewarding investigations. CEA was a sensitive means of identifying disseminated recurrent disease and liver metastases compared with liver function tests or liver ultrasound every 3 months. Endoscopy was useful in the diagnosis of local recurrences. However no follow-up test was capable of detecting recurrent colorectal cancer when it might still have been curable. As a direct result of this follow-up programme 15 patients (23%) underwent re-exploration. No symptomatic patients were candidates for curative re-operation. Of the asymptomatic patients six (four colonic and two rectal cancers) (19.5%) were re-resected for cure. Only three of these were alive and without evidence of disease, 40, 43 and 69 months later so that long term survivors after curative re-resection represent only 5% of all patients with recurrences (7.2% of the recurrent colonic cancer and 3% of the rectal cancer). Our follow-up programme did not permit us to alter the incidence of disseminated recurrent disease, and the effectiveness of the curative re-resection represents an increase of only 1.3% in the global 5-year survival rates for colorectal cancer. Our study does not demonstrate any great value of 'classical' postoperative follow-up programme.
Document 12 (Title: Colorectal cancer): If there are only a few metastases in the liver or lungs, these may also be removed. Chemotherapy may be used before surgery to shrink the cancer before attempting to remove it. The two most common sites of recurrence of colorectal cancer are the liver and lungs. For peritoneal carcinomatosis cytoreductive surgery, sometimes in combination with HIPEC can be used in an attempt to remove the cancer. Chemotherapy In both cancer of the colon and rectum, chemotherapy may be used in addition to surgery in certain cases. The decision to add chemotherapy in management of colon and rectal cancer depends on the stage of the disease.
Document 13 (Title: Resection of synchronous liver metastases from colorectal cancer.): Whereas resection for metachronous liver metastases from colorectal cancer is considered to be a potentially curative approach, little is known about the prognosis after resection of synchronous liver metastases. In the past, these patients usually underwent only palliative therapy. Therefore, we have analyzed the data of 36 patients who underwent curative hepatic resection of synchronous liver metastases from colorectal carcinomas from 1977 to 1987 at the Department of Surgery, Hannover Medical School. In 19 patients, liver resection was combined with colonic resection; in the other 17 patients, hepatic resection was performed after a median interval of 2 months following resection of the primary tumor. No operative mortality was observed in either of the approaches. The median survival time was 28 months for all patients with a median recurrence-free interval of 13.5 months. Overall 5-year survival probability for all patients was 20%. There were no significant differences observed between immediate or delayed liver resection (median survival 18 months versus 31 months). Survival rates were not different after resection of solitary versus multiple liver metastases (26 versus 28 months). Twenty-one of the 36 patients had a recurrence of their liver metastases. In 7 of them, curative liver resection could be performed again. These 7 patients had a significantly improved survival (p less than 0.05) compared to the residual 14 patients. It is concluded that patients with synchronous liver metastases from colorectal cancer may profit from resection of the primary tumor and liver metastases. Timing of liver resection--immediate versus delayed--obviously has no impact on survival rates.

Document 15 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): cancer primary. This was due in part to the recognition that many other primary cancers (such as breast cancer) represent a systemic disease when liver metas-tases are present. However, more recent studies have shown acceptable 5-year survival rates in the 20% to 40% range for resection of hepatic metastases from breast, renal, and other GI tumors.115,116 In a large study of hepatic resection for non-colorectal, nonendocrine liver metastases in 1452 patients, neg-ative prognostic factors were nonbreast origin, age >60 years, disease-free interval of <12 months, need for major hepatec-tomy, performance of R2 resection, and presence of extrahe-patic metastases.115TREATMENT OPTIONS FOR LIVER CANCERIn general, the major treatment options for liver cancer can be categorized as shown in Table 31-7. The decision making for any given patient is complex and is best managed by a multidis-ciplinary liver tumor board. The treatments listed in Table 31-7 are not mutually exclusive; the important
