Document 1 (Title: Porphyria cutanea tarda): Patients who are diagnosed with PCT typically seek treatment following the development of photosensitivities causing blisters and erosions on exposed areas of the skin. This is usually observed in the face, hands, forearms, and lower legs. Healing is slow and leaves scarring. Though blisters are the most common skin manifestations of PCT, other skin manifestations include hyperpigmentation (similar to a tan) and hypertrichosis (mainly on the cheeks) also occur. PCT is a chronic condition, with external symptoms often subsiding and recurring as a result of multiple factors. In addition to the skin lesions, chronic liver disease is very common in patients with sporadic PCT. This involves hepatic fibrosis (scarring of the liver), and inflammation. However, liver problems are less common in patients with the inherited form of the disease. Additionally, patients will often void a wine-red color urine with an increased concentration of uroporphyrin I due to their enzymatic deficiency.
Document 2 (Title: Basal cell carcinoma and breast carcinoma following repeated fluoroscopic examinations of the chest.): A 69-year-old white Italian woman was first seen at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in 1981 concerning several skin growths on her back. The patient had had several basal cell carcinomas surgically removed from her back during the preceding 5 years. There was no history of arsenic ingestion or prolonged sun exposure and her family history was negative for skin cancer. The patient had developed pulmonary tuberculosis in 1938 and was treated with pneumothorax therapy. She had had more than 50 fluoroscopic examinations of the chest following this therapy, as well as multiple diagnostic x-ray films since that time. She recalled that she had faced the fluoroscopy beam during the procedure. In 1959, she had a transabdominal hysterectomy for fibroid tumors. In 1980 she underwent a right modified radical mastectomy for adenoid cystic carcinoma of the breast; biopsies of lymph nodes were negative. Physical examination revealed a thin, white woman with a right mastectomy scar. On the back, clustered in the interscapular region, were multiple scars and nine erythematous nodules with pearly borders, telangiectasia, and translucent surfaces. Within several nodules there were areas of light and dark brown pigmentation. There were no other suspicious lesions on the head, chest, or extremities, nor did the patient show any evidence of the basal cell nevus syndrome. Biopsy of all lesions revealed basal cell carcinoma, some of which were pigmented, without evidence of chronic radiodermatitis. All lesions were treated with curettage and electrodesiccation three times with good cosmetic results (Fig. 1).
Document 3 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): James L. Zehnder, MD and edema and is tender to touch. Oxygen saturation by fingertip pulse oximeter while breathing room air is 87% (normal > 90%). Ultrasound reveals a deep vein thrombosis in the left lower extremity; chest computed tomography scan confirms the presence of pulmonary emboli. Laboratory blood tests indicate elevated d-dimer levels. What therapy is indicated acutely? What are the long-term therapy options? How long should she be treated? Should this indi-vidual use oral contraceptives? A 25-year-old woman presents to the emergency depart-ment complaining of acute onset of shortness of breath and pleuritic pain. She had been in her usual state of health until 2 days prior when she noted that her left leg was swollen and red. Her only medication was oral contraceptives. Family history was significant for a history of “blood clots” in mul-tiple members of the maternal side of her family. Physical examination demonstrates an anxious woman with stable vital signs.

Document 4 (Title: Case Study: 8-Year-Old With a Murmur and Hypertension (Archived) -- Case Presentation): An 8-year-old female presents to the emergency department (ED) referred by her primary care provider (PCP) for left-sided neck swelling and murmur. Per the patient’s mother, the patient has had left-sided neck swelling for 1 month. The patient also experienced subjective fevers, chills, headaches, and malaise. Over that same period, mom also noticed about 5 pounds (2 kg) of weight loss and intermittent side pain. Because of these concerns, mom took her daughter to the PCP 2 weeks before ED presentation and was diagnosed with lymphadenitis and started on oral amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and told to follow up the following week. At the following visit, there was a minimal improvement of the neck swelling, so the patient was switched to oral clindamycin. After a week of being on the clindamycin, the patient presented again to the PCP with minimal improvement of her symptoms. At this visit, the PCP also noticed a new cardiac murmur. Because the patient had failed outpatient antibiotic therapy and had this new heart murmur, the PCP referred the patient to the ED.
Document 5 (Title: Case Study: 33-Year-Old Female Presents with Chronic SOB and Cough (Archived) -- Case Presentation): History of Present Illness: A 33-year-old white female presents after admission to the general medical/surgical hospital ward with a chief complaint of shortness of breath on exertion. She reports that she was seen for similar symptoms previously at her primary care physician’s office six months ago. At that time, she was diagnosed with acute bronchitis and treated with bronchodilators, empiric antibiotics, and a short course oral steroid taper. This management did not improve her symptoms, and she has gradually worsened over six months. She reports a 20-pound (9 kg) intentional weight loss over the past year. She denies camping, spelunking, or hunting activities. She denies any sick contacts. A brief review of systems is negative for fever, night sweats, palpitations, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, neural sensation changes, muscular changes, and increased bruising or bleeding. She admits a cough, shortness of breath, and shortness of breath on exertion.
Document 6 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): A 21-year-old woman comes with her parents to discuss therapeutic options for her Crohn’s disease. She was diag-nosed with Crohn’s disease 2 years ago, and it involves her terminal ileum and proximal colon, as confirmed by colonoscopy and small bowel radiography. She was initially treated with mesalamine and budesonide with good response, but over the last 2 months, she has had a relapse of her symptoms. She is experiencing fatigue, cramping, abdominal pains, and nonbloody diarrhea up to 10 times daily, and she has had a 15-lb weight loss. She has no other significant medical or surgical his-tory. Her current medications are mesalamine 2.4 g/d and budesonide 9 mg/d. She appears thin and tired. Abdominal examination reveals tenderness without guarding in the right lower quadrant; no masses are palpable. On perianal examination, there is no tenderness, fissure, or fistula. Her laboratory data are notable for anemia and elevated C-reactive protein. What are the options for immediate
Document 7 (Title: Biochemistry_Lippinco): Case 2: Skin Rash Patient Presentation: KL is a 34-year-old woman who presents with a red, nonitchy rash on her left thigh and flu-like symptoms. Focused History: KL reports that the rash first appeared a little over 2 weeks ago. It started out small but has gotten larger. She also thinks she is getting the flu because her muscles and joints ache (myalgia and arthralgia, respectively), and she has had a headache for the last few days. Upon questioning, KL reports that she and her husband took a camping trip through New England last month. Pertinent Findings: The physical examination is remarkable for the presence of a red, circular, flat lesion ~11 cm in size that resembles a bullseye (erythema migrans) (see image at right). KL also has a low-grade fever. Diagnosis: KL has Lyme disease caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, which is transmitted by the bite of a tick in the genus Ixodes. Infected ticks are endemic in the Northeast region of the United States.
Document 8 (Title: [A case of dermatomyositis which rapidly developed to respiratory failure in the presence of pneumomediastinum].): A 49-year-old woman was admitted in February 1987, with a six-month history of joint pain, maculopapular and erythematous rash, proximal muscle weakness and a two-month history of skin ulceration and dyspnea on exertion. Physical examination showed Gottron's papules on her fingers and a faint heliotrope rash. Biopsy of erythematous skin lesions on the shoulder and the back of the hand revealed perivascular inflammatory cell infiltration and tiny ulcerative lesions of the cutaneous tissue. Biopsy of the right quadriceps muscle showed type II fiber atrophy and slight perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate, whereas serum CPK level was within normal range. Chest X-ray film showed granular infiltrates in both lower lung fields. Based on the current findings the case was diagnosed as dermatomyositis associated with interstitial pneumonia. The administration of prednisolone, 30 mg/day resulted in the improvement of the skin lesions and muscle weakness, while the intensity of lung infiltrates was little affected. Three months after steroid therapy, the patient was readmitted because of increasing dyspnea on exertion and multiple skin ulcers. Chest X-ray revealed a small amount of gas in the mediastinum, in addition to slight deterioration of interstitial lung disease. In spite of various treatments for pneumomediastinum, including bed rest, administration of analgesics and oxygen inhalation, it developed rapidly, complicated severe subcutaneous emphysema and right-sided pneumothorax. Although high-dose prednisolone therapy and mediastinal drainage were performed, the pneumomediastinum was not resolved and she died from respiratory failure. At autopsy, predominant histological features of the lungs were acute interstitial pneumonia with hyaline membrane and edematous granulation formation in the alveoli.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Document 9 (Title: Porphyria Cutanea Tarda -- History and Physical -- Cutaneous Manifestations): Photosensitivity, along with the formation of skin blisters, vesicles, bullae, and increased fragility of the skin, is seen on sun-exposed parts of the body. This most commonly involves the back of the hands, forearms, neck, face, and feet. These repeated insults to the skin later resolve, leaving behind hyper- and hypopigmented scars and milia, which are small yellowish-white keratin filled papules. [10] Since PCT is delayed blistering photosensitivity, most patients do not associate sun exposure with their skin lesions. [4] These skin lesions arise from minor trauma and sometimes may get infected, causing intense pain and inflammation. [18] The scarring may lead to contractures mimicking the skin findings of a patient with scleroderma, thus labeling this phenomenon as "pseudoscleroderma." [19] Scarring alopecia on the scalp can lead to a diffuse hair loss.
Document 10 (Title: Syringoma): Treatment The goal of treatment is to improve the appearance of lesions, since they are otherwise not serious and typically do not cause symptoms. Many treatment methods have been attempted, but complete removal is uncommon. No single treatment method has been shown to work consistently. Both medical and surgical treatments have been studied, each with variable success. Common destructive treatment methods include carbon dioxide lasers, dermabrasion, surgical excision, electrocoagulation, and chemical peels. Many of these methods are very time-consuming and require multiple treatment sessions. Carbon dioxide lasers are the most commonly practiced method; they can cause thermal damage, though, leading to scarring in the area. Medical therapies include topical atropine, topical retinoids, and oral tranilast. The most common adverse effects include redness, skin discoloration, and pain. Other side effects include blistering and scarring.
Document 11 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): A 59-year-old woman presents to an urgent care clinic with a 4-day history of frequent and painful urination. She has had fevers, chills, and flank pain for the past 2 days. Her physician advised her to come immediately to the clinic for evaluation. In the clinic she is febrile (38.5°C [101.3°F]) but otherwise stable and states she is not experiencing any nausea or vomiting. Her urine dipstick test is positive for leukocyte esterase. Urinalysis and urine culture are ordered. Her past medical history is significant for three urinary tract infections in the past year. Each episode was uncom-plicated, treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and promptly resolved. She also has osteoporosis for which she takes a daily calcium supplement. The decision is made to treat her with oral antibiotics for a complicated urinary tract infection with close follow-up. Given her history, what would be a reasonable empiric antibiotic choice? Depending on the antibiotic choice are there potential drug
Document 12 (Title: Defamation -- Definition/Introduction -- What are Defamation and Cyber Defamation?): Case 2. A 33-year-old female underwent elective breast augmentation and botulinum toxin injections 2 weeks ago. After the dressing came off, she was not satisfied with the result. The surgeon had told her she had to wait until the swelling and edema subsided. Only then would she see the cosmetic benefits. The patient went on social media and posted negative reviews about the surgeon. She claimed she had suffered major complications from breast augmentation and that the surgeon ignored her. She suggested that other patients not visit this surgeon for cosmetic surgery because he was reluctant to see her after the surgery. Her opinion was that the surgeon was not skilled and incompetent. The surgeon came across the review on Yelp and filed a lawsuit for defamation. In court, the surgeon had the appointment book, pre-and post-surgery photos, and all the communications between himself and the patient. The surgeon claimed in court that he never neglected the patient, asked her to follow up, and waited for the swelling to subside before she saw the cosmetic result. She instead defamed him on social media, and the jury sided with him. The surgeon also claimed that this false statement about him has resulted in a decline in new patients seeking surgery. The patient lost the lawsuit and paid the surgeon over $300,000 in damages.
Document 13 (Title: Pemphigoid): Presentation Primary lesions of small and large blisters, known as vesicles and bullae, are found on the skin and sometimes on the mucous membranes. Non-bullous pemphigoid In some patients, pemphigoid starts off with cutaneous manifestations of BP without bullae, as the only sign of the disease. Pruritic eczematous, papular, or urticaria-like skin lesions may also persist for weeks to months. Bullous phase The bullous stage of BP shows vesicles and bulla, appearing on apparently normal or erythematous skin, predominantly at the flexural aspects of the extremities and the lower trunk. Mucosal lesions, which typically are erosions of the oral mucosa, are present in 10 to 30 percent of patients. Occasionally, the blister fluid becomes blood-tinged. The blisters are tense, about 1–4 cm in diameter, leaving eroded and crusted areas, together with urticarial and infiltrated papules and plaques in an annular or figurate pattern.
Document 14 (Title: Root Cause Analysis and Medical Error Prevention -- Function -- Case example 1): A 42-year-old primigravida woman at 34 weeks gestation was brought to the obstetric emergency department at midnight with complaints of severe headache, blurry vision, and right upper quadrant pain for the last 5 to 6 hours. She noted lower extremity edema and facial swelling that was gradually increasing. She has gestational hypertension and, 1 week ago, was prescribed labetalol 200 mg twice a day. On initial presentation, her blood pressure was 190/110 mm Hg on 2 separate occasions, 5 minutes apart. She had gained 2 kilograms since her last antenatal checkup in the clinic a week ago. The patient was diagnosed with severe preeclampsia. The senior obstetric resident ordered a loading dose of magnesium sulfate to prevent imminent seizure. The hospital protocol used an intravenous (IV) and intramuscular (IM) regimen where the patient received a 4 g IV bolus and a 10 g IM dose administered as 5 g in each buttock. The senior resident gave verbal orders for magnesium sulfate administration to the junior resident, who verbally communicated the order to the nurse.
Document 15 (Title: [McArdle's disease without typical symptoms].): A 25-year-old female with McArdle's disease was reported. She had no characteristic symptoms for McArdle's disease such as muscle cramp and brown urine, but had general fatiguability from childhood. On examination, she showed no neurological abnormalities including muscle atrophy and weakness. On laboratory examination, serum creatinine kinase (CK) level was elevated, though serum lactic acid level remained unchanged after the ischemic forearm exercise test. Muscle biopsy from the biceps brachii showed almost completely absent phosphorylase activity both histochemically and biochemically. Thus, she was diagnosed as having McArdle's disease. The skinned fiber test of the muscle showed no enhanced Ca induced Ca release (CICR), and serum VLDL level was normal. Her 27-year-old elder brother had similar clinical symptoms and serological abnormalities and may also have McArdle's disease, although muscle biopsy was not performed. A possibility of McArdle's disease should be considered when we encounter a patient who has only general fatigue and high serum CK level.

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
Question: A 48-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of a photosensitive blistering rash on her hands, forearms, and face for 3 weeks. The lesions are not itchy. She has also noticed that her urine has been dark brown in color recently. Twenty years ago, she was successfully treated for Coats disease of the retina via retinal sclerotherapy. She is currently on hormonal replacement therapy for perimenopausal symptoms. Her aunt and sister have a history of a similar skin lesions.
