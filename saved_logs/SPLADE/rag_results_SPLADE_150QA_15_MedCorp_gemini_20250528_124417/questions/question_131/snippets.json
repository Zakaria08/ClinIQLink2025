        "content": "We have isolated, characterized, and partially sequenced immunoglobulin from the most primitive extant nonvertebrate craniate, the hagfish, a jawless fish that may have diverged from the vertebrate lineage more than 500 million years ago. The 160-kDa protein, which is a minor serum component, is composed of two different heavy chains of 69 and 74 kDa and a light chain of 29 kDa and resembles known immunoglobulin on the basis of an equimolar ratio of heavy and light chains, N-linked glycosylation of heavy chains, presence of intra- and interchain disulfide bonds, and polydispersity of each peptide chain. High molecular mass (polymeric) as well as low molecular mass (monomeric) forms were isolated from serum. The hagfish immunoglobulin is unique in that each heterodimer is composed of two different heavy chains and two light chains. The partial peptide maps and amino acid compositions of the two heavy chains differ; the chains do not crossreact immunologically. Slight crossreactivity of the 74-kDa heavy chain with antisera against purified shark immunoglobulin and some conservation of amino acid sequences, including those surrounding a cysteine, suggest that the isolated protein is an immunoglobulin.",

        "content": "Immunoglobulin D (IgD) is an antibody isotype that makes up about 1% of proteins in the plasma membranes of immature B-lymphocytes where it is usually co-expressed with another cell surface antibody called IgM. IgD is also produced in a secreted form that is found in very small amounts in blood serum, representing 0.25% of immunoglobulins in serum. The relative molecular mass and half-life of secreted IgD is 185 kDa and 2.8 days, respectively. Secreted IgD is produced as a monomeric antibody with two heavy chains of the delta (\u03b4) class, and two Ig light chains. Function The function of IgD has been a puzzle in immunology since its discovery in 1964. IgD is present in species from cartilaginous fish to human (with the possible exception of birds). This nearly ubiquitous appearance in species with an adaptive immune system demonstrates that IgD may be as ancient as IgM and suggests that IgD has important immunological functions.",

We now report the isolation and characterization of another form of immunoglobulin-associated amyloid obtained from a patient who had extensive systemic amyloidosis and in whom the amyloid deposits consisted not of light chains but rather of an unusual form of heavy chain. This component, isolated from splenic amyloid extracts, represented an internally deleted IgG1 heavy chain as evidenced by immunochemical, electrophoretic, and amino acid sequence analyses.

The structural abnormality of the amyloid gamma-chain protein was further evidenced by SDS/PAGE and immuno-blotting analyses: An unusually low molecular mass of approximately 22 kDa was found for this material vs. the expected value of approximately 55 kDa for a normal gamma heavy chain. Despite the lack of certain Fc determinants, the amyloid and urinary heavy-chain proteins expressed the IgG1 subclass allotype marker G1m(a) located on the third constant region (CH3) domain of the internally deleted IgG1 heavy chains.

These studies also revealed that the gamma-chain amyloid protein contained the complete heavy-chain variable (VH) domain [including the diversity (DH) and joining (JH) segments] that was contiguous with the CH3 domain.

The intact 19 S dynein, containing the alpha- an beta-heavy chains, intermediate chains (ICs) 1-5 and light chains (LCs) 1-6, yielded several discrete particles: a 17.5 S adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) composed of the alpha- and beta-chains ICs 3-5 and LC 1; a 9.5 S complex containing ICs 1 and 2 together with LCs 2, 3, 4, and 6; and a single light chain (LC 5), which sedimented at approximately 4 S. In some experiments, ICs 3-5 also separated from the heavy chain complex and were obtained as a distinct subunit. Further dissociation of the 17.5 S particle yielded a 13.1 S ATPase that contained the beta-heavy chain and ICs 3-5. The polypeptide compositions of the complexes provide new information on the intermolecular associations that occur within dynein. Substructural features of the trout dynein polypeptides also were examined. The heavy chains were subjected to vanadate-mediated photolysis at the V1 sites by irradiation at 365 nm in the presence of Mg2+, ATP, and vanadate. Fragment pairs of relative molecular mass (Mr) 245,000/185,000 and 245,000/170,000 were obtained from the alpha- and beta-heavy chains, respectively. Photolysis of these molecules at their V2 sites, by irradiation in the presence of vanadate and Mn2+, yielded fragments of Mr 160,000/270,000 and 165,000/250,000, respectively. These values confirm that the alpha- and beta-heavy chains have masses of 430,000 and 415,000 daltons, respectively. Immunological analysis using monoclonal antibodies revealed that one intermediate chain from trout dynein (IC 2) contains epitopes present in two different intermediate chains from Chlamydomonas dynein. This indicates that specific sequences within the dynein intermediate chains have been highly conserved throughout evolution.",
        "contents": "Outer-arm dynein from trout spermatozoa: substructural organization. Outer-arm dynein purified from trout spermatozoa was disrupted by low-ionic-strength dialysis, and the resulting subunits were separated by sucrose density-gradient centrifugation. The intact 19 S dynein, containing the alpha- an beta-heavy chains, intermediate chains (ICs) 1-5 and light chains (LCs) 1-6, yielded several discrete particles: a 17.5 S adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) composed of the alpha- and beta-chains ICs 3-5 and LC 1; a 9.5 S complex containing ICs 1 and 2 together with LCs 2, 3, 4, and 6; and a single light chain (LC 5), which sedimented at approximately 4 S. In some experiments, ICs 3-5 also separated from the heavy chain complex and were obtained as a distinct subunit. Further dissociation of the 17.5 S particle yielded a 13.1 S ATPase that contained the beta-heavy chain and ICs 3-5. The polypeptide compositions of the complexes provide new information on the intermolecular associations that occur within dynein. Substructural features of the trout dynein polypeptides also were examined. The heavy chains were subjected to vanadate-mediated photolysis at the V1 sites by irradiation at 365 nm in the presence of Mg2+, ATP, and vanadate. Fragment pairs of relative molecular mass (Mr) 245,000/185,000 and 245,000/170,000 were obtained from the alpha- and beta-heavy chains, respectively.

        "content": "Some antibodies, like IgM, can have\u00a05 duplicates of the structure above to form a pentamer capable of binding up to ten antigens.

[4] The chemical structure of these dimers is essential for binding IgE-specific cellular receptors Fc-epsilon RI and CD23, which will be discussed in more detail later. Some immunoglobulins, such as IgG, contain a \"hinge\" region near the molecule's center. IgE is unique because it lacks this hinge region and is replaced by the C-epsilon2 domain.
