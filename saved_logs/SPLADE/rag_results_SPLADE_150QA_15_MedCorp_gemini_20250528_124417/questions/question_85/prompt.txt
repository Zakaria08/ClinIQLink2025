Document 1 (Title: Abnormal Papanicolaou Smear -- Clinical Significance): Atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance , ASC-US: This management plan depends on the age of the patient. For patients between 21 and 24, repeat Pap smear in 1 year if the status of the HPV is positive or unknown. It is also acceptable to perform a reflex HPV test on the same pap smear sample. HPV status will determine future pap smear frequencies. If HPV is negative, then the patient is recommended for follow-up in 3 years. If the follow-up Pap smear continues to show ASC-US, then an additional Pap smear in 1 year is recommended. For patients between 25 and 29, screening is still the same if they have negative HPV. However, if they have positive HPV, colposcopy is recommended instead of waiting one year for a follow-up pap smear. If at the follow-up pap smear, ASC-US is still present, the next step is colposcopy. For patients between 30 to 65 years of age, there is a more significant concern for the progression of cervical cancer. If ASC-US is documented on a pap smear and they are HPV negative, they will follow the same process as the other age groups. If HPV status is positive or unknown, then a repeat pap smear is recommended within four months.
Document 2 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): of the anus has increased dramatically among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)–positive men who have sex with men. This increase is thought to result from increased rates of HPV infection along with HIV-induced immu-nosuppression. Treatment of high-grade dysplasia is ablation. Because of a high recurrence and/or reinfection rate, these patients require close surveillance. High-risk patients should be followed with frequent anal Papanicolaou (Pap) smears every 3 to 6 months. An abnormal Pap smear should be followed by an examination under anesthesia and anal mapping using high-resolution anoscopy. High-resolution anoscopy shows areas with abnormal telangiectasias that are consistent with high-grade dysplasia. Many centers now consider this technique for repeated ablation of high-grade lesions to be the optimal method for following these patients.148-150 It should be noted, however, that the practice has not been universally adopted, and it is unclear whether close surveillance in
Document 3 (Title: Adherence to recommendations for early repeat cervical smear tests.): To assess adherence to recommendations for an early repeat cervical smear test in women with reports of cytological abnormalities, and to evaluate the impact of reminder letters to medical practitioners when such smear tests are overdue. Observational study. Cytology (gynaecological) service for Victoria, Australia. Two groups of women who had abnormal cervical smears during 1985. Women in group A had some evidence of an important dysplasia and were advised to have a repeat smear in three months' time whereas women in group B had a less serious abnormality and were advised to have a repeat smear test in six months' time. In all, 971 of the 1036 women in group A and 1401 of the 1464 women in group B were eligible to have a repeat smear analysed by the service. If a repeat smear had not been received within three months of the recommended date a reminder letter generated by the service's computer was sent to the medical practitioner who had taken the smear. Thirty six months after the report on the abnormal smear was issued. In all, 870 (90%) of the women in group A and 1154 (82%) of the women in group B had a repeat smear test. The mean time to a repeat test was 3.0 months (95% confidence interval 0.5 to 16.4) in group A and 6.0 months (1.2 to 30.3) in group B. The reminder letter to the practitioner potentially increased the rate of return for a repeat smear test by 18% in group A and 24% in group B. Adherence to the recommendation for a repeat test increased with increasing age. Achieving high rates of follow up smear tests and appropriate management in women with cytological abnormalities is critical to the impact of a screening programme for cervical cancer. The reminder system used in this study was not labour intensive or expensive and provided a fail safe mechanism for ensuring that reports of abnormal smears were not overlooked.
Document 4 (Title: Pap test): More frequent Pap smears may be needed to follow up after an abnormal Pap smear, after treatment for abnormal Pap or biopsy results, or after treatment of cancer ( cervical, colon, etc ). Effectiveness The Pap test, when combined with a regular program of screening and appropriate follow-up, can reduce cervical cancer deaths by up to 80%. Failure of prevention of cancer by the Pap test can occur for many reasons, including not getting regular screening, lack of appropriate follow-up of abnormal results, and sampling and interpretation errors. In the US, over half of all invasive cancers occur in females who have never had a Pap smear; an additional 10 to 20% of cancers occur in those who have not had a Pap smear in the preceding five years. About one-quarter of US cervical cancers were in people who had an abnormal Pap smear but did not get appropriate follow-up (patient did not return for care, or clinician did not perform recommended tests or treatment).
Document 5 (Title: Adherence): Adherence, Adherer, and derivative terms may refer to: Healthcare Adherence (medicine), the obedience of the patient to the medical advice Adhesion (medicine), abnormal bands of tissue that grow in the human body Other uses Adherent point, mathematical notion, also known as closure point, point of closure or contact point Adhesion, the tendency of dissimilar particles or surfaces to cling to one another Religious adherence, when people follow a particular religion
Document 6 (Title: Georgios Papanikolaou): In 1928, Papanikolaou told an incredulous audience of physicians about the noninvasive technique of gathering cellular debris from the lining of the vaginal tract and smearing it on a glass slide for microscopic examination as a way to identify cervical cancer. That year, he had undertaken a study of vaginal fluid in women, in hopes of observing cellular changes over the course of a menstrual cycle. In female guinea pigs, Papanicolaou had already noticed cell transformation and wanted to corroborate the phenomenon in human females. It happened that one of Papanicolaou's human subjects was suffering from uterine cancer. Upon examination of a slide made from a smear of the patient's vaginal fluid, Papanicolaou discovered that abnormal cancer cells could be plainly observed under a microscope. "The first observation of cancer cells in the smear of the uterine cervix," he later wrote, "gave me one of the greatest thrills I ever experienced during my scientific career."
Document 7 (Title: Pneumonia in an Immunocompromised Patient -- Deterrence and Patient Education): To prevent pneumonia in immunocompromised individuals, the following are recommended: Immunization against influenza (annually) and Pneumococcus . Vaccination against other encapsulated bacteria such as H. influenzae should also be done. Live attenuated vaccines are to be avoided, which include the intranasal influenza vaccine. Avoidance of unnecessary immunosuppression, e.g., avoiding unnecessary glucocorticoid use HIV-infected individuals should adhere to their antiretroviral therapy regimen. Compliance and adherence to antimicrobial prophylaxis Regular follow-up with a physician so that any abnormality may be caught early on. Maintain a healthy diet and lifestyle
Document 8 (Title: Abnormal Papanicolaou Smear -- Clinical Significance): The Papanicolaou smear is an effective screening test that detects cervical cancer as well as cellular changes that have the potential to develop into cervical cancer. Any diagnosis of an atypical pap smear results in more frequent and/or further testing. Below are the current recommendations from ACOG for each abnormal result.
Document 9 (Title: Natural history of the minimally abnormal Papanicolaou smear.): We sought to determine the natural history of the cytologic and colposcopic changes in patients with minimal abnormalities on their Papanicolaou smears (atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance or low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion [SIL]). Between November 1988 and November 1990, 632 women with abnormal Papanicolaou smears as listed above were evaluated at Los Angeles County-Olive View Medical Center. Each had review of cytology, repeat Papanicolaou smear, and colposcopy of the lower genital tract. We excluded those who were pregnant or had findings demonstrative of moderate dysplasia or worse, or had a cervical biopsy for any other indication. Women with symptomatic vaginal discharge were treated and remained in the study. Subjects were followed every 3 months with repeat Papanicolaou smear and colposcopy for a minimum of 9 months. If at any time the Papanicolaou smear or colposcopy was consistent with moderate dysplasia or worse, directed biopsies and endocervical curettage were performed, and treatment was given accordingly. Two hundred ninety-four patients fulfilled all inclusion criteria and had adequate follow-up data. Nine months after enrollment, 42 of 91 women (46.2%) with atypical squamous cells had persistent changes, none had progression, and 49 (53.8%) had regression to normal. In those with low-grade SIL, 37 of 203 cases (18.2%) persisted, seven (3.4%) progressed, and 159 (78.3%) regressed by 9 months. Patients in the first group were more likely to have persistence of the cytologic abnormalities than were those in the second (P less than .01). Only the latter group progressed to high-grade dysplasia during the 9-month study interval. The majority of women with confirmed minimal cytologic changes on Papanicolaou smear will have complete colposcopic and cytologic regression over a short interval.
Document 10 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Once the acute episode has resolved, the priority in management is to ensure long-term clinical follow-up and adherence to a regimen of secondary prophylaxis. Patients should be entered onto the local ARF registry (if present) and contact made with primary care practitioners to ensure a plan for follow-up and administration of secondary prophylaxis before the patient is discharged. Patients and their families should also be educated about their disease, emphasizing the importance of adherence to secondary prophylaxis. Ideally, primary prevention would entail elimination of the major risk factors for streptococcal infection, particularly overcrowded housing. This is difficult to achieve in most places where ARF is common.
Document 11 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): care facilities and hospice care allow patients to retain dignity when they have a limited short-term outlook.Follow-Up CarePatients diagnosed and treated for a head and neck tumor require follow-up care aimed at monitoring for recurrence and the side effects of therapy. The NCCN guidelines recommend follow-up assessment every 3 months for the first year after treatment, every 4 months during the following year, and then every 6 months until year 4, with an annual follow-up at 5 years post treatment and thereafter.106 This regimen is not well followed in North America, and further investigation is required to assess why this might be and to improve adherence rates.210 Follow-up should consist of a thorough history to assess for any emerg-ing symptoms such as pain, otalgia, or dysphagia as these are often the first sign of a recurrence. Assessment by speech lan-guage pathology and a dietician is often beneficial to ascertain swallowing function and nutritional intake, respectively.
Document 12 (Title: Clubfoot): The Ponseti Method is highly effective with short-term success rates of 90%. However, anywhere from 14% to 41% of children experience a recurrence of the deformity. The most common reason for this is inadequate adherence to bracing, such as not wearing the brace properly, not keeping it on for the recommended length of time, or not using it every day. Children who do not follow proper bracing protocol have up to seven times higher recurrence rates than those who follow bracing protocol, as the muscles around the foot can pull it back into the abnormal position. Recurrence is more common when there is poor compliance with the bracing, because the muscles around the foot can pull it back into the abnormal position. Low parental education level and failure to understand the importance of bracing is a major contributor to non-adherence. Relapses are managed by repeating the casting process. Relapsed feet may also require additional, more extensive surgeries and have a reduced chance of
Document 13 (Title: CO2 laser vaporization in the treatment of cervical human papillomavirus infection in women with abnormal Papanicolaou smears.): In a randomized study, we have evaluated the treatment of cervical human papillomavirus (HPV) lesions by CO2 laser vaporization. Fifty patients with abnormal Papanicolaou smears and histological evidence of cervical HPV infection associated or not with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade I were randomized to either a treatment or a control group. The cervical swabs were obtained every 3 months in both groups and examined for HPV type 16 DNA by the polymerase chain reaction. After a follow-up period of 12 months no significant differences were found between the laser treatment and the control groups in relation to the disappearance of the abnormal Papanicolaou smear. Two patients in the treatment group and 3 in the control group had a conization because of development of CIN I or aggravation of the concomitant CIN found at the initial visit. The percentage of women who demonstrated HPV in their cervical smears at 12 months' follow-up was identical in the two groups, supporting the hypothesis that HPV is a persistent infection during which the virus is widespread in the vaginal epithelium.
Document 14 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): of Occupational Exposures to HIV and Recommendations for Postexposure Prophylaxis (CDC, 2005). The report emphasizes the importance of adherence to PEP when it is indicated, follow-up of exposed workers to improve PEP adherences, monitoring for adverse events (including seroconversion), and expert consultation in the management of exposures.
Document 15 (Title: Reasons for inappropriate simple hysterectomy in the presence of invasive cancer of the cervix.): We evaluated 148 women who had had simple hysterectomy in the presence of invasive cervical cancer between the years 1973-1987. Two had microinvasive squamous carcinoma for which hysterectomy was not a planned procedure. The remaining 146 women all had either adenocarcinoma or squamous carcinoma exhibiting greater than 3 mm of stromal invasion of lymph-vascular space involvement. Medical records were reviewed retrospectively to determine the reasons for hysterectomy. Causes of inappropriate hysterectomy were as follows: inadequate evaluation of an abnormal Papanicolaou smear or cervical biopsy (21%), failure to perform an indicated conization (12%), deliberate hysterectomy for grossly invasive cancer of the cervix (11%), lack of preoperative Papanicolaou smear (7%), conization margins positive or not evaluated (7%), misreading of pathology results (5%), emergent operation because of bleeding (3%), failure to check cytology preoperatively (1.5%), and failure to biopsy a gross cervical lesion (1.5%). The remaining 31% of cases had normal or inflammatory Papanicolaou smears and negative cervical examinations. Although 93% of this latter group complained of abnormal bleeding, 78% did not have endocervical or endometrial sampling preoperatively. Despite the increasing emphasis on cervical cancer screening, the number of referrals following hysterectomy performed in the presence of cervical carcinoma is not decreasing. Most cases could be avoided by careful adherence to well-established guidelines for cervical cancer detection.
