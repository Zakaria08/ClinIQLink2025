Accordingly, myocardial contrast echocardiography was performed at baseline and after each placement of venous graft in 21 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft operations.

Successful on-line quantitation of myocardial contrast echocardiography data was performed in 17 patients; this allowed comparison before and after coronary artery bypass graft operations for 21 grafts, with agreement between expert visual analysis and quantitative data in 91% of these cases. Three distinct perfusion patterns were noted on myocardial contrast echocardiography: (1) reduced contrast effect before coronary artery bypass graft operations with improvement after coronary artery bypass graft operations (n = 11); (2) adequate contrast effect before coronary artery bypass graft operations with no change after coronary artery bypass graft operations (n = 9) (for patients in group 2, the mean percentage of coronary stenosis was less than the mean for patients in group 1-67% +/- 25% vs. 88% +/- 20%, p = 0.05); and (3) no contrast effect either before or after coronary artery bypass graft operations in one patient with previous infarction.

        "content": "The introduction of selective coronary arteriography and aorto-to-coronary saphenous vein bypass surgery (a.-c bypass) has fundamentally altered our understanding of ischemic heart disease (IHD). The indications for the effective diagnostic procedure and the results of the new and increasingly important surgical technique are summarized. Selective coronary arteriography should be performed (a) in patients with known IHD in order to furnish the anatomical and functional information necessary to assess the indication for surgery, i.e. in patients below 60 years with intractable stable or unstable (impending infarction) angina. It is rarely indicated in patients with an old myocardial infarction who are free from symptoms. It is debatable in patients during the acute stage of infarction; (b) in patients with questionable IHD, with the aim of ruling out or confirming the condition, i.e. mainly in patients with atypical chest pain or with equivocal ecg findings. The risks of the procedure, if carried out by experienced personnel, are small. Selective arteriography will always be supplemented by a selective left ventricular angiography yielding important information concerning the functional behaviour of the myocardium. In judging the therapeutic value of a.-c. bypass surgery it should be noted that postoperatively 60 to 70 percent of the patients present without symptoms and 80 to 95 percent feel markedly better, and that physical performance is enhanced in about the same proportions. An improvement in left ventricular function under exercise conditions seems to be rare. Hospital mortality of a.-c. bypass operation is small and below 5 percent if patients with stable angina and without myocardial failure, previous infarctions or mitral regurgitation are considered. In the presence of an ischemic cardiomyopathy, on the other hand, the mere surgical risk soon reaches prohibitive limits. The incidence of early complicating myocardial infarctions ranges around 10 percent. Bypass occlusion occurs in some 5 to 15 percent during the early postoperative phase, while in the following months and years the patency rate diminishes but little. If the survival rates of operated and non-operated patients with IHD are compared it becomes evident that a prolongation of life is possible whenever surgery aims at a correction of two- and three-vessel disease (including the prognostically unfavourable isolated stenosis of the left anterior descending branch and stenosis of left main artery) whereas the natural course of isolated lesions of the right coronary artery and the left circumflex branch seems to balance the effect of corresponding surgical interventions.

        "title": "[Balloon dilatation of subclavian artery stenosis and brachiocephalic trunk stenosis].",
        "content": "We report our initial experiences concerning percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of four subclavian artery stenoses and one innominate artery stenosis in four patients. In two patients the indication for percutaneous transluminal angioplasty was a severe subclavian steal syndrome, in one patient prophylactic treatment together with carotid endarterectomy before coronary bypass surgery, and in one patient a brainstem infarction. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty resulted in normal vertebral artery blood flow in all patients and in complete relief of symptoms in the two patients with a subclavian steal syndrome. We experienced no cerebrovascular complications and only one minor peripheral complication. During a follow-up period of seven to 18 months there has been no re-occlusion and no sign of increasing subclavian steal phenomenon. We draw the following conclusions: Selection criteria for percutaneous transluminal angioplasty must be very strict. Doppler sonography before percutaneous transluminal angioplasty is necessary to evaluate the haemodynamic effect of subclavian stenosis upon the vertebral arteries. Doppler sonographic monitoring during percutaneous transluminal angioplasty should be a routine. The risk of cerebral complications is low. Gradual normalisation of vertebral blood flow after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty is common. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty is judged to be a safe and effective treatment for patients suffering from subclavian steal syndrome.",

        "content": "Some limited studies have indicated that IV-DSA is not suitable for patients with diabetes or kidney failure because the dye load is significantly higher than that used in arteriography. However, IV-DSA has been used successfully to study the vessels of the brain and heart and has helped detect carotid artery obstruction and to map patterns of cerebral blood flow. It also helps detect and diagnose lesions in the carotid arteries, a potential cause of strokes. IV-DSA has also been useful in assessing patients prior to surgery and after coronary artery bypass surgery and some transplant operations.",
