Document 1 (Title: Intravenous prophylhexedrine (Benzedrex®) abuse and sudden death.): Propylhexedrine was implicated in 15 deaths investigated by the Dallas County Medical Examiner since 1973. Twelve of the deaths were attributable to intravenous abuse of the contents of the Benzedrex® inhaler. Each death could be defined as sudden. Pulmonary edema, foreign body granulomas, fibrosis and evidence of pulmonary hypertension were frequent postmortem findings. Right ventricular hypertrophy was present in nine of the 12 subjects who died of intravenous propylhexedrine abuse. Two homicides and one suicide were propylhexedrine-related. Intravenous propylhexedrine abuse should be considered in the differential diagnosis of right ventricular hypertrophy and/or pulmonary hypertension, and it should be suspected in cases of sudden death involving young adults displaying evidence of intravenous drug abuse.

Document 3 (Title: Inappropriate Medication in the Geriatric Population -- Introduction): Potentially inappropriate medications (PIM) can be defined as drugs that pose an increased risk of causing adverse events. [1] The American Geriatrics Society Beers Criteria® is a set of recommendations for avoiding PIMs in the geriatric population. [2] Initially published in 1991, the AGS Beers Criteria® has been periodically updated to provide more accurate and practical guidelines for healthcare providers. [3] [4] [1] The AGS Beers Criteria® is consistently revised by an interprofessional team utilizing an evidence-based approach. [3] [5] The latest version of the AGS Beers Criteria® was written in 2019 to assist practicing clinicians in outpatient, acute, and institutional settings. It includes medications evaluated in 5 main categories: drugs to avoid, drugs to use with caution, drug-drug interactions, medications to avoid in particular clinical situations, and dosage according to kidney function. [3] The AGS Beers Criteria® is a guideline for practitioners to improve prescriptions, outcomes, and quality of care. Although this list is a comprehensive guide for clinicians, nurses, pharmacists, patients, and their families, it complements clinical judgment as each scenario is unique. [3] This topic presents the main issues of concern, clinical significance, and interprofessional aspects of the AGS Beers Criteria®.

The ASD is round and has an acceptable margin of tissue to seat a septal occluder device. CHAPTER 297e Atlas of Percutaneous Revascularization FIGURE 297e-18 ASD percutaneous closure devices. The Amplatzer® septal occluder (left) and the HELEX® septal occluder (right) are among the devices used for percutaneous closure of ASDs. The Amplatzer® septal occluder is a plug between two disks that are positioned on each side of the ASD to obstruct blood flow. The HELEX® Septal Occluder is positioned on each side of the ASD to allow circular rings covered with rapidly stretching polytetrafluoroethylene device to limit blood flow. The delivery catheters are detached and the devices are left in place. (Illustration by Justin E. Tribuna.)
Document 5 (Title: MasterFormat): Related Organizational Formats SectionFormat® is a standard for organizing information within each Section. Like MasterFormat®, SectionFormat® is a joint publication of the Construction Specifications Institute (CSI) and Construction Specifications Canada (CSC). It is used by MasterSpec, SpecText, NMS, and SpecsIntact systems. It is also common among manufacture specifications and design firm office masters. A Section is divided into three Parts; "Part 1 - General," "Part 2 - Products," and "Part 3 - Execution." Each Part is further organized into a system of Articles and Paragraphs. MasterFormat®'s Division 01 is extensively coordinated with SectionFormat®'s Part 1 to reduce duplication of requirements common to multiple sections.
Document 6 (Title: Inappropriate Medication in the Geriatric Population -- Other Issues -- Limitations to the AGS Beers Criteria®): The AGS Beers Criteria® complements clinical judgment and decision-making and should not be used independently to add or remove medications for patients. Treatment should be individualized, understanding that patients are complex and conditions differ between individuals . [3] The AGS Beers Criteria® does not always apply to hospitalized and palliative care patients. Risk-benefit ratios vary in these settings, and there are innumerable scenarios to consider. [3] [4] Finally, the AGS Beers Criteria® was validated using evidence from the United States and is not necessarily applicable in all countries. [3]
Document 7 (Title: VIX): In addition to VIX, CBOE uses the same methodology to compute the following related products: CBOE ShortTerm Volatility Index (VIX9DSM), which reflects 9-day expected volatility of the S&P 500 Index, CBOE S&P 500® 3-Month Volatility Index (VIX3MSM), CBOE S&P 500® 6-Month Volatility Index (VIX6MSM) CBOE S&P 500 1-Year Volatility Index (VIX1YSM). CBOE also calculates the Nasdaq-100® Volatility Index (VXNSM), CBOE DJIA® Volatility Index (VXDSM) and the CBOE Russell 2000® Volatility Index (RVXSM). There is even a VIX on VIX (VVIX) which is a volatility of volatility measure in that it represents the expected volatility of the 30-day forward price of the CBOE Volatility Index (the VIX®).

Document 9 (Title: Rabbit hemorrhagic disease): Disinfection Caliciviruses are stable in the environment and difficult to inactivate. Products commonly used for household disinfection such as Clorox® and Lysol® disinfecting wipes do not work against these viruses. One effective option is to wipe down surfaces with a 10% bleach solution, allowing 10 minutes of contact time before rinsing. Other disinfectants shown to work include 10% sodium hydroxide, 2% One-Stroke Environ®, Virkon® S, Clorox® Healthcare Bleach Germicidal Wipes, Trifectant®, Rescue®, and hydrogen peroxide cleaners. Surface debris must always be mechanically removed prior to disinfection. A list of disinfectants that are effective against calicivirus (in this case norovirus) can be found on the Environmental Protection Agency's website. Studies have show that many quaternary ammonium compound based disinfectants do not inactivate caliciviruses.
Document 10 (Title: Semaglutide -- Continuing Education Activity): Semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as 3 separate brand name medications—Ozempic ® , Wegovy ® , and Rybelsus ® . Each brand name comes with its own associated indications, preparations, and dosages to consider. The Rybelsus ® tablet brand demonstrates efficacy in improving glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Ozempic ® injectable brand provides an additional indication of reducing the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with and without T2DM. In a recent development, semaglutide received FDA approval under the brand name Wegovy ® , which is an injection used for promoting weight loss in individuals dealing with obesity and overweight. Due to the increased complexity involved, special attention is necessary for every FDA-approved indication and current off-label use.

Document 12 (Title: Semaglutide -- Administration -- Subcutaneous semaglutide for chronic weight management Wegovy ®): For chronic weight management with subcutaneous semaglutide (Wegovy ® ), it is necessary to follow the following steps: Wegovy ® dosage should be administered 0.25 mg weekly for the first 4 weeks. Wegovy ® dosage should be increased to 0.5 mg weekly for weeks 5 through 8. Wegovy ® dosage should be further increased to 1 mg weekly for weeks 9 through 12. Wegovy ® dosage should be further progressed to 1.7 mg weekly for weeks 13 through 16. Finally, Wegovy ® should be maintained at a dosage of 2.4 mg weekly thereafter.
Document 13 (Title: Antimetabolite): Examples of cancer drug antimetabolites include, but are not limited to the following: 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) 6-Mercaptopurine (6-MP) Capecitabine (Xeloda®) Cytarabine (Ara-C®) Floxuridine Fludarabine Gemcitabine (Gemzar®) Hydroxycarbamide Methotrexate Pemetrexed (Alimta®) Phototrexate Anti-metabolites masquerade as a purine (azathioprine, mercaptopurine) or a pyrimidine, chemicals that become the building-blocks of DNA. They prevent these substances from becoming incorporated into DNA during the S phase (of the cell cycle), stopping normal development and cell division. Anti-metabolites also affect RNA synthesis. However, because thymidine is used in DNA but not in RNA (where uracil is used instead), inhibition of thymidine synthesis via thymidylate synthase selectively inhibits DNA synthesis over RNA synthesis.
Document 14 (Title: Collaboration -- Issues of Concern): IPE is a structured curriculum to establish competencies in collaboration. The TeamSTEPPS® 2.0 curriculum was developed by the Agency of Health Research and Quality (AHRQ) to promote collaboration as a clinical competency. [2] Based on 25 years of research, the curriculum, which originated from the US Department of Defense (DoD), was adopted by AHRQ.  TeamSTEPPS®  is designed to address three specific components of collaboration and teamwork: (1) performance, (2) knowledge and (3) attitudes.  As shown in Figure 1, the TeamSTEPPS® model connects these three components to the essentials of leadership, situation monitoring, mutual support, and communication.   This IPE curriculum is designed to shift the attitudes and behavior of HCP's towards collaboration and teamwork as a means of quality improvement.

Document 15 (Title: Absorption and disposition of econazole nitrate after application to the skins and vaginas of rabbits.): 1. The absorption and tissue distribution of radioactivity has been studied in rabbits after application of a cream containing 10 mg of the 3H-labelled 1-(2,4-dichloro-beta-[(p-chlorobenzyl)oxy]phenethyl) imidazole nitrate (econazole nitrate, Pevaryl) to the normal or abraded skins of rabbits. 2. Approximately one-third of the dose was absorbed through the occluded normal skins of rabbits during 8 days, mainly during 7 to 24 h. In the same time interval, slightly more of the dose was absorbed through the occluded abraded skins of rabbits at slightly greater rates. Co-formulation of triamcinolone acetonide in the cream reduced and delayed the peak rates of absorption through normal and abraded skin, but the extent of absorption during 8 days was similar in the presence or absence of triamcinolone acetonide. 3. After application to normal skin or abraded skin, the peak of mean concentrations in the plasma of 220 ng/ml (range 132-276 ng/ml) or 307 ng/ml (range 270-321 ng/ml), respectively, occurred at 24 h. Tissue distribution of radioactivity was similar after application to normal or abraded skin, and concentrations were highest in the liver, kidneys and gastrointestinal tract (which are the organs of biotransformation and excretion) and also in the adrenals and to a lesser extent in the uterus, ovaries and untreated skin. 4. After application of a cream containing 5 mg of 3H-econazole nitrate to the vaginas of rabbits, approximately one-third of the dose was absorbed during 8-24 h, and rates of excretion were higher through the more permeable vaginal membrane. 5. After vaginal doses of 5 mg, a peak concentration of 209 ng/ml occurred at 6 h in the plasma. Tissue concentrations of radioactivity after vaginal doses were highest in liver, kidneys, gastrointestinal tract, adrenals and ovaries, and the tissue distribution was similar to that observed after cutaneous doses.
