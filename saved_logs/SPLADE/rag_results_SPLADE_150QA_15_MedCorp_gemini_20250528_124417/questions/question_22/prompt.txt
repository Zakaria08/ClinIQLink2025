Document 1 (Title: Inactivation of muscle chloride channel by transposon insertion in myotonic mice.): MYOTONIA (stiffness and impaired relaxation of skeletal muscle) is a symptom of several diseases caused by repetitive firing of action potentials in muscle membranes. Purely myotonic human diseases are dominant myotonia congenita (Thomsen) and recessive generalized myotonia (Becker), whereas myotonic dystrophy is a systemic disease. Muscle hyperexcitability was attributed to defects in sodium channels and/or to a decrease in chloride conductance (in Becker's myotonia and in genetic animal models). Experimental blockage of Cl- conductance (normally 70-85% of resting conductance in muscle) in fact elicits myotonia. ADR mice are a realistic animal model for recessive autosomal myotonia. In addition to Cl- conductance, many other parameters are changed in muscles of homozygous animals. We have now cloned the major mammalian skeletal muscle chloride channel (ClC-1). Here we report that in ADR mice a transposon of the ETn family has inserted into the corresponding gene, destroying its coding potential for several membrane-spanning domains. Together with the lack of recombination between the Clc-1 gene and the adr locus, this strongly suggests a lack of functional chloride channels as the primary cause of mouse myotonia.
Document 2 (Title: Cell_Biology_Alberts): A gene encoding channelrhodopsin was introduced into a subpopulation of neurons in the hypothalamus of a mouse. When the neurons were exposed to flashing blue light using a tiny, implanted fiber optic cable, the channelrhodopsin channels opened, depolarizing and activating the cells. When the light was switched on, the mouse immediately became aggressive and attacked the inflated rubber glove; when the light was switched off, its behavior immediately returned to normal (Movie 11.11). (From D. Lin et al., Nature 470:221–226, 2011. With permission from Macmillan Publishers Ltd.) inactivate specific neurons. It is therefore now possible to transiently activate or inhibit specific neurons in the brains of awake animals with remarkable spatial and temporal precision. In this way, the rapidly expanding new field of optogenetics is revolutionizing neurobiology, allowing neuroscientists to analyze the neurons and circuits underlying even the most complex behaviors in experimental animals,
Document 3 (Title: Biochemistry, Chloride Channels -- Function): Members of the CLC channel family, are named as CIC-1, 2, 3, etc., and are voltage-gated channels that modulate a verity of cellular functions. CIC-1 is the major Cl- channel in skeletal muscle, maintaining the resting potential of the sarcoplasmic reticulum and regulating repolarization after contraction. CIC-2 is expressed ubiquitously and activated by cellular swelling, acidic pH and hyperpolarization, modulating intracellular chloride concentration, cell volume regulation, and modifying neuronal excitability. CIC-5 is predominantly expressed in the kidneys and may play a part of proximal tubule endocytosis. CIC-3 and CIC-4 function are not clearly understood and under investigation. ClC-K/Barttin channels are two members of the CLC family that function in basolateral Cl- recycling and are also predominantly expressed in the kidney (thick ascending loop of Henle and distal nephron) and inner ear. CFTR is a voltage-independent chloride channel located in the apical membrane of many epithelia, most predominantly in those of the airways, intestines, secretory glands, epididymis, and bile ducts. In some epithelial, such as that of the intestine, CFTR may account for the entire apical chloride conductance and thus plays a crucial role in salt and fluid secretion and absorption. CFTR may also be essential in the acidification of the Golgi bodies and endosomes and has been studied as a regulator of other ion channels such as ENaC. GABA- and glycine-gated chloride channels function to regulate membrane electrical excitability, specifically, by causing neuronal inhibition. GABA is predominantly used in the brain, while glycine is more common in the spinal cord and brain stem. In adult brains, binding of these neurotransmitters to their corresponding ligand-gated anion channel causes Cl- influx into the cell, which leads to hyperpolarization and neuronal activity inhibition. However, early in development, a more positive equilibrium potential of Cl- in undeveloped neurons causes excitability in response to GABA and glycine. Glycine receptors control motor rhythm generation, coordinate spinal reflex responses, and modulate processing by sensory neurons. [3] [5]
Document 4 (Title: Photostimulation): It has been shown that channelrhodopsin-2, a monolithic protein containing a light sensor and a cation channel, provides electrical stimulation of appropriate speed and magnitude to activate neuronal spike firing. Recently, photoinhibition, the inhibition of neural activity with light, has become feasible with the application of molecules such as the light-activated chloride pump halorhodopsin to neural control. Together, blue-light activated channelrhodopsin-2 and the yellow light-activated chloride pump halorhodopsin enable multiple-color, optical activation and silencing of neural activity.

Document 5 (Title: Channelrhodopsin): Mutating E90 to the positively charged amino acid arginine turns channelrhodopsin from an unspecific cation channel into a chloride-conducting channel (ChloC). The selectivity for Cl- was further improved by replacing negatively charged residues in the channel pore, making the reversal potential more negative. Anion-conducting channelrhodopsins (iChloC, iC++, GtACR) inhibit neuronal spiking in cell culture and in intact animals when illuminated with blue light.
Document 6 (Title: The role of the subthalamic nucleus in experimental chorea. Evidence from 2-deoxyglucose metabolic mapping and horseradish peroxidase tracing studies.): In previous studies we have shown that hemichorea can be induced in the conscious monkey by localized injection of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) antagonists into the contralateral lentiform complex. It has been argued that the primary site of drug action in inducing chorea is the lateral segment of the globus pallidus. In the present study, the neural mechanisms which underlie this experimental dyskinesia were investigated by two separate approaches. First, the efferent projections of the lentiform complex were mapped using neuroanatomical tracing techniques. This involved injecting horseradish peroxide into sites which had previously given chorea when injected with the GABA antagonist bicuculline. Secondly, the 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) metabolic mapping technique was applied to animals during active dyskinesia. This procedure permitted the autoradiographic measurement of local cerebral glucose uptake which was used as an index of regional synaptic activity. In both instances, the strongest labelling was seen in the dorsolateral region of the subthalamic nucleus. On the basis of this finding it is suggested that the pallidosubthalamic pathway plays a crucial role in the mediation of experimentally-induced chorea. Specifically, the pallidosubthalamic pathway arising from the lateral pallidal segment is abnormally overactive, which causes physiological inhibition of the subthalamic nucleus. The pattern of 2-DG uptake in the medial segment of the globus pallidus and thalamus was similar to that seen in animals with experimentally-induced ballism. This similarity is interpreted as suggesting that a common neural mechanism underlies both experimentally-induced chorea and ballism.
Document 7 (Title: Propofol -- Mechanism of Action): Like most general anesthetic agents, the mechanism of action for propofol is poorly understood but thought to be related to the effects on GABA-mediated chloride channels in the brain. Propofol may work by decreasing the dissociation of GABA from GABA receptors in the brain and potentiating the inhibitory effects of the neurotransmitter. This, in turn, keeps the channel activated for a longer duration, resulting in an increase in chloride conductance across the neuron, causing a hyper-polarization of the cell membrane, making it harder for a successful action potential to fire. [4]
Document 8 (Title: Histology_Ross): A mutation that disrupts the gene that produces espin causes cochlear and vestibular symptoms in experimental mice. They lose their hearing early in life; these animals also spend most of their time walking or spinning in circles. The stereocilia of these animals do not maintain the rigidity necessary for proper functioning of the MET channels. All hair cells use mechanically gated ion channels to generate action potentials. All hair cells of the internal ear appear to function by moving (pivoting) their rigid stereocilia. Mechanoelectric transduction
Document 9 (Title: Cell_Biology_Alberts): Using genetic engineering techniques, channelrhodopsin can be expressed in virtually any cell type in vertebrates and invertebrates. Researchers first introduced the gene into cultured neurons and showed that flashing light could now activate the channelrhodopsin and induce the neurons to fire action potentials. Because the frequency of the light flashes determined the frequency of the action potentials, one can control the frequency of neuronal firing with millisecond precision. Next, neurobiologists used the approach to activate specific neurons in the brain of experimental animals. Using a tiny fiber optic cable implanted near the axon at time = 0 (triggering of action potential)
Document 10 (Title: Biochemistry, Chloride Channels -- Clinical Significance): Besides being linked to numerous genetic disorders, chloride channels are also the target of medications that treat a variety of conditions. For example, GABA and glycine receptors are targets of a wide range of clinically important drugs, such as antiepileptic agents, anxiolytics, sedatives, hypnotics, muscle relaxants, and anesthetics. Additionally, medications that directly target chloride channels known as CFTR modulators are being developed to treat CF. Chloride channels modulators also have the potential of treating other disorders such as secretory diarrheas, polycystic kidney disease, osteoporosis, and hypertension. Furthermore, mutations in specific chloride channels that cause known human diseases have been identified and are useful for screening, diagnosis, and targeted therapies. As an example, pulmonary gene therapy for cystic fibrosis patients has been developed where corrected copies of the CFTR gene are delivered using viral and non-viral vectors. [9] [10]
Document 11 (Title: Agonists at mu-opioid, M2-muscarinic and GABAB-receptors increase the same potassium conductance in rat lateral parabrachial neurones.): 1. Intracellular recordings of membrane potential and current were made from neurones in the lateral parabrachial nucleus in slices of rat brain in vitro. 2. The membrane was hyperpolarized by the opioid peptides Tyr-D-Ala-Gly-MePhe-Gly-ol (DAGOL, 0.01-1 microM) and [Met5]enkephalin (3-30 microM), though not by Tyr-D-Pen-Gly-Phe-D-Pen and U50488. In two experiments, naloxone competitively antagonized the effects of DAGOL and [Met]enkephalin with equilibrium dissociation constants of 0.8 and 3.2 nM, respectively. 3. Baclofen (0.3-30 microM) also hyperpolarized the neurones; this action was unaffected by naloxone. 4. DAGOL, [Met5]enkephalin and baclofen caused outward currents at the resting potential. These currents reversed polarity at a membrane potential which changed with the logarithm of the extracellular potassium concentration. 5. Muscarine has been shown previously to increase the potassium conductance by an action at M2-receptors: the potassium currents induced by maximal concentrations of muscarine, baclofen and [Met5]enkephalin were non-additive, indicating that these agonists opened the same population of potassium channels. 6. Noradrenaline, UK14304, carboxamidotryptamine, dopamine, adenosine and somatostatin had little or no effect on membrane potential. 7. It is concluded that rat lateral parabrachial neurones express mu-opioid, gamma-aminobutyric acidB (GABAB), and M2-muscarinic receptors: activation of any of these receptors increases the potassium conductance of the membrane and inhibits the neurones through hyperpolarization.

For management of the CF, the family was referred to the CF center at the regional children’s hospital. Prognosis: CF is the most common life-limiting autosomal-recessive disease in Caucasians. Case-Related Questions: Choose the ONE best answer. Q1. CF is the result of mutations to the gene that encodes the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein that functions as a chloride channel in the apical membrane of epithelial cells on a mucosal surface. Which of the following statements concerning CF is correct? A. Clinical manifestations of CF are the consequence of chloride retention with increased water reabsorption that causes mucus on the epithelial surface to be excessively thick and sticky. B. Excessive pancreatic secretion of insulin in CF commonly results in hypoglycemia.
Document 13 (Title: Channelrhodopsin): Channelrhodopsins can be readily expressed in excitable cells such as neurons using a variety of transfection techniques (viral transfection, electroporation, gene gun) or transgenic animals. The light-absorbing pigment retinal is present in most cells (of vertebrates) as Vitamin A, making it possible to photostimulate neurons without adding any chemical compounds. Before the discovery of channelrhodopsins, neuroscientists were limited to recording the activity of neurons in the brain and correlate this activity with behavior. This is not sufficient to prove that the recorded neural activity actually caused that behavior. Controlling networks of genetically modified cells with light, an emerging field known as Optogenetics., allows researchers now to explore the causal link between activity in a specific group of neurons and mental events, e.g. decision making. Optical control of behavior has been demonstrated in nematodes, fruit flies, zebrafish, and mice. Recently,
Document 14 (Title: The KROX-24 protein, a new transcription regulating factor: expression in the rat central nervous system following afferent somatosensory stimulation.): The expression of the protein product encoded by the Krox-24 gene was investigated immunocytochemically in the central nervous system of adult rats. Immunoreactivity (IR) of the KROX-24 protein which is a nuclear transacting transcription factor, showed a pattern of nuclear staining. Basal KROX-24-IR was visible in the superficial layers of spinal dorsal horn and trigeminal nucleus, and in many areas of the brain including the cerebellum, nucleus raphe magnus, colliculi, periaqueductal gray, hypothalamus, geniculate nuclei, caudate putamen, amygdala, hippocampus, lateral septal nucleus, olfactory tubercle and cerebral cortex. Electrical stimulation of sciatic nerve A- and C-fibers, but not of A alpha- and A beta-fibers alone, induced transient expression of KROX-24 in numerous spinal neurons in the termination area of the stimulated nerve. One hour following the onset of this stimulation of the sciatic nerve the distribution of KROX-24-IR was investigated in the brain and compared to untreated rats. In stimulated animals, the KROX-24-IR was induced in many areas including the lateral reticular nucleus, parabrachial nucleus, periaqueductal gray, hypothalamus, amygdala and lateral habenular nucleus.
Document 15 (Title: Primidone -- Mechanism of Action): The mechanism of action of primidone is not well-known, but it appears to bind centrally with voltage-gated sodium channels and inhibits the monotonous firing of action potentials. [9] Primidone also activates gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-A receptor complex with chloride ionophore, which extends the frequency of opening of the chloride channel, causing hyperpolarization by altering the electrical activity of the nerve cell membrane. [10] The effect of primidone in treating essential tremor is not mediated by the active metabolite PEMA. [11] Because in vivo investigations proved that primidone inhibits TRPM3 and attenuates thermal nociception, this drug could have a role in pain medicine. [12]
