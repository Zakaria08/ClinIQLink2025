What is the difference between DNA proofreading and repair? Case 6: Dark Urine and Yellow Sclerae Patient Presentation: JF is a 13-year-old boy who presents with fatigue and yellow sclerae. Focused History: JF began treatment ~4 days ago with a sulfonamide antibiotic and a urinary analgesic for a urinary tract infection. He had been told that his urine would change color (become reddish) with the analgesic, but he reports that it has gotten darker (more brownish) over the last 2 days. Last night, his mother noticed that his eyes had a yellow tint. JF says he feels as though he has no energy.
Document 2 (Title: Annular pancreas): Causes It is typically associated with abnormal embryological development, however adult cases can develop. It can result from growth of a bifid ventral pancreatic bud around the duodenum, where the parts of the bifid ventral bud fuse with the dorsal bud, forming a pancreatic ring. It can also result if the ventral pancreatic bud fails to fully rotate, so it remains on the right or if the dorsal bud rotates in the wrong direction, such that the duodenum is surrounded by pancreatic tissue. Blockage of the duodenum develops if inflammation (pancreatitis) develops in the annular pancreas.
Document 3 (Title: [Child abuse: report of three cases].): Child abuse, a clinical condition in young children who have received serious physical abuse, is a frequent cause of permanent injury or death. The first case is a 7-year-old boy suffering from abdominal distension and pain for 3 days. He was beaten by his mother as a result of inadequately learning his lessons. Sonogram and CT of the abdomen showed massive ascites and a pseudocyst of the pancreatic body about 3 x 3 cm in diameter. The second case is a 4-year-old girl who developed a semicomatose state after her father impulsively struck her with a chair. CT of the brain revealed subdural hematoma over the left fronto-temporal region and midline shift to the right. She expired 5 days later. The third case, a 2-year-old girl, suffered from headache, seizure, vomiting and general malaise. CT of the brain showed severe brain swelling over the right side and midline shift to the left. She expired 1 month later. Psychiatric factors are probably of prime importance in the pathogenesis of the disorder, but our knowledge of these factors is limited. Parents who inflict abuse on children do not necessarily have psychopathic or sociopathic personalities or come from borderline socioeconomic groups, although most published cases fall into one of these categories. It is clearly the responsibility of all physicians serving children to be aware of, to recognize, and to properly manage any child who has been the victim of abuse.
Document 4 (Title: 38-Year-Old Male Presents With Lower Extremity Edema -- Case Presentation): His physical exam revealed clear lungs and a normal heart exam on auscultation. His abdomen was soft and non-tender, and his skin was warm and dry with no rash. He had 2 plus pitting edema at the ankles. Initial laboratory data was consistent with acute kidney injury (AKI) with worsening creatinine from 1.2 to 1.6 over 1 month and nephrotic range proteinuria. Serologies for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, anti-nuclear antibody (ANA), c-ANCA, serine protease 3 (PR3) IgG, myeloperoxidase antibody (MPO), and complement levels were sent. He was started on losartan for proteinuria with plans for renal biopsy; however, he was lost to follow up. The patient then presented two weeks later with worsening edema to his waist, continued weight gain, mild hemoptysis, and streaks of blood in the stool. Physical examination now showed worsening pitting edema up to his waist with new non-pruritic, erythematous excoriations on the medial aspect of his thighs bilaterally. He was admitted to the hospital with concern for worsening vasculitis. He was started on oral prednisone and underwent a renal biopsy. For his edema, he was started on diuretics to which he responded well. Due to persistent leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing was performed to complete the workup.
Document 5 (Title: Pennsylvania Child Abuse Recognition and Reporting -- Pearls and Other Issues -- A 13-year-old girl is brought to her pediatrician because of a recent decline in her grades. During a private interview, she admits she has "problems with boys at school" and "bad dreams about boys always staring at her." The child privately admits she regularly gets up in the middle of the night and sleeps with the biological mother on her side of the bed, with her stepfather next to her mother. The child indicates the stepfather has commented that she is a "looker," has "big headlights," and needs to "fend off the boys at school." The pediatrician attended high school with the stepfather and knows he is not the "brightest bulb" but seems to care about the child genuinely. The child indicates the stepfather wears pajamas, has never touched her, and always knocks before entering the bathroom or her room. She says she is very anxious about attending school and is afraid to speak with her mother about her school problems. She says her stepfather has always been "very good" to her mother and is always kind and considerate to her as well. She does not want to get him into trouble but feels his comments about her appearance add to her anxiety. What should the pediatrician do in this situation?): Given the totality of the circumstances, there may not be reasonable cause to suspect child abuse; however, there remain numerous concerns, such as the child's problems at school, nightmares, child co-sleeping at the age of 13, and the stepfather's inappropriate comments to the child. General concerns for a child's safety, health, and well-being may be reported to ChildLine for assessment of services and support. The PA CPSL prescribes that a person, hospital, institution, school, facility, agency, or agency employee acting in good faith shall have immunity from civil and criminal liability that might otherwise result from making a report of suspected child abuse or making a referral for general protective services, regardless of whether the report is required to be made under the PA CPSL.
Document 6 (Title: Ectopia cordis): Ectopia cordis (Greek: "away / out of place" + Latin: "heart") or ectopic heart is a congenital malformation in which the heart is abnormally located either partially or totally outside of the thorax. The ectopic heart can be found along a spectrum of anatomical locations, including the neck, chest, or abdomen. In most cases, the heart protrudes outside the chest through a split sternum. Pathology Ectopia cordis results from a failure of proper maturation of midline mesoderm and ventral body wall (chest) formation during embryonic development. The exact etiology remains unknown, but abnormalities in the lateral body wall folds are believed to be involved. Normally, the lateral body walls are responsible for fusion at the midline to form the ventral wall. Corruption of this process may underlie ectopia cordis.
Document 7 (Title: [Long-term nasogastric feeding and complications of acute gastric ulcer in two elderly patients].): Some elderly patients with chronic illness such as stroke, or Parkinsonism cannot take food orally because of dysphagia. In such cases, tube feeding can be used as a supplement to oral intake when malnutrition is present. This route allows for easier nursing care and decreases the frequency of aspiration pneumonia. Complications of tube feeding include nutrient deficiency states, pulmonary aspiration, gastrointestinal and metabolic disorders. We report two cases with complications of acute gastric ulcer which was thought to be induced with long-term tube feeding. Case 1 was a 61-year-old male patient with Parkinson's disease for ten years. L-DOPA had been administered with good control of his condition. However, his ability to swallow has deteriorated gradually. As he often suffered from aspiration pneumonia, nasogastric tube feeding was performed. After three years of tube feeding, he suddenly vomited much bloody material. He died from massive bleeding with acute gastric dilatation. Autopsy showed giant acute gastric ulcer covered with coagulated blood. UL3, 50 mm in maximum diameter, was observed in the middle portion of the greater curvature, where the top of tube probably came in contact with the gastric wall. Case 2 was an 83-year-old female patient with stroke and chronic heart failure. She had been hospitalized for about one year because of the intermittent deterioration of her cardiac condition. Furthermore, her inability to swallow increased during her hospitalization. She also suffered from aspiration pneumonia. Nasogastric tube feeding was performed to prevent aspiration pneumonia and malnutrition. She died of acute heart failure after twelve months. Autopsy revealed heart dilatation, old myocardial infarction and stroke. In addition, two acute gastric ulcers (UL3.10 and 30 mm in diameter) were recognized; one was in the upper portion of the greater curvature, the other in the lower portion of the greater curvature. The location of these gastric ulcers was unusual. Moreover, they coincided with location of top of the nasogastric tube. From these two cases, we conclude that in long-term tube feeding the tip of the tube often comes in contact with the gastric wall, and gastric ulcer could be produced by repeated mechanical stimulus of the wall. Reports of acute gastric ulcer induced by tube feeding have not been published previously. Therefore, we should pay much attention to this complication in the care of the elderly people with long-term tube feeding.
Document 8 (Title: [Neonatal gastric necrosis].): Neonatal necrotizing gastritis is rare. It is usually a complication of acute anoxia or shock and its diagnosis is essentially radiological. Case no. 1: a boy was born at the 36th week of a pregnancy complicated by preeclampsia. Perinatal asphyxia necessitated delivery by cesarean section. He presented with neonatal respiratory distress which was complicated by pneumothorax. On the 5th day of life, the abdomen was distended and the newborn had still not been fed. On the 6th day, X-rays showed pneumatosis of the gastric wall associated with pneumoperitoneum. Surgery showed an area of necrosis on the posterior surface of the stomach with a small perforation, which was stitched. The child was fed 5 days later and was in good condition at the age of 6 months. Case no. 2: a girl was born at the 35th week of a pregnancy complicated by asthma during the second trimester. Perinatal asphyxia and abnormal fetal rhythm led to delivery by cesarean section. At 24 hour of life, she vomited blood and fibroscopy confirmed the presence of blood in the stomach. On the 3rd day, blood vomiting appeared again, associated with abdominal distension. X-rays showed pneumatosis of the gastric wall; fibroscopy showed necrosis of the lower 2/3 of the stomach. Feeding was stopped and the child was given cimetidine. Refeeding was possible when the girl was 10 days old, and she was in good condition at the age of 6 months. Neonatal gastric necroses and necrotizing enterocolitis have many similar features. Medical therapy is often effective, but surgery is mandatory when necrotizing gastritis is complicated by perforation.
Document 9 (Title: Case Study: 24-Year-Old Male Presenting With Polyarthralgias (Archived) -- Confirmatory Evaluation): During a follow-up appointment a few weeks later, he complained of multiple subcutaneous nodules. On physical exam, multiple, tender, non-erythematous subcutaneous nodules were noted along with a palpable, non-tender mass on the left side of the abdomen. CT abdomen showed a large heterogeneous mass measuring 20.1 by 10.7 by 18.1 cm, in the left quadrant of the abdomen along with a poorly defined low attenuation mass measuring 2.9 by 3 cm in the right hepatic lobe. CT guided biopsy of the left-sided abdominal mass was non-diagnostic. He underwent exploratory laparotomy, with excision of the left-sided abdominal mass along with splenectomy and distal pancreatectomy. There were multiple abnormal areas in the liver concerning for metastases. Pathology of the resected mass revealed sheets of malignant acinar cells with no intervening ductal structures or islets. Tumor cells were positive for trypsin and cytokeratin and were negative for CD117 and synaptophysin, consistent with pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma. Serum CA 19-9 levels were high. Lipase levels were elevated at 40,000U/dL. At this point, based on the biopsy and staging, the patient was diagnosed with stage IV pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma, but the cause of his polyarthralgia was still uncertain. Adjuvant chemotherapy was initiated with leucovorin, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and oxaliplatin for the carcinoma. During his treatment, his joint swelling and pain progressed and involved new joints of right ankle and left knee. Imaging studies of the joints showed joint effusion and soft tissue swelling. Arthrocentesis of the right ankle joint was performed, and the synovial fluid studies were consistent with infection and cultures were positive for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Pseudomonas. He was treated with antibiotics including vancomycin and piperacillin–tazobactam without any improvement. Due to progressive worsening of the right ankle joint, he required irrigation and debridement with arthrotomy. Repeat cultures were negative, but his symptoms continued to worsen, and he had persistent drainage of milky colored fluid from the surgical site and eventually required a below-knee amputation. Surgical pathology of the right knee joint revealed acute on chronic inflammation with the presence of granulation and fibrin tissue, without any evidence of malignancy. For further evaluation, arthrocentesis of left knee, left ankle, and right wrist was done and yielded milky colored fluid. His lipase levels continued to remain above 20,000 U/dL despite being treated with chemotherapy.
Document 10 (Title: Tracheoesophageal septum): The tracheoesophageal septum is an embryological structure. It is formed from the tracheoesophageal folds or ridges which fuse in the midline. It divides the oesophagus from the trachea during prenatal development. Developmental abnormalities can lead to a tracheoesophageal fistula. Structure The tracheoesophageal septum is formed from the tracheoesophageal folds laterally (longitudinal ridges), which fuse in the midline. It divides the oesophagus from the trachea. This is complete by 6 weeks of gestation. It divides the foregut tube: the laryngotracheal tube ventrally and oesophagus dorsally. Function The tracheoesophageal septum divides the oesophagus from the trachea during prenatal development.
Document 11 (Title: Pennsylvania Child Abuse Recognition and Reporting -- Pearls and Other Issues -- A 16-year-old child presents to the emergency department due to acting out at school. Shortly after arrival, the child asks for a sandwich. The school could not reach the biological mother, and the biological father is deceased. The child indicates his mother is on a honeymoon on a boat somewhere in the Cayman Islands. He is currently being taken care of by his grandmother, who is at work as a dietician, but she will be home shortly. The mother left him with $200 ten days ago and told him to buy local fast food for both of them for dinner. He admits he was told not to spend more than $20 daily and avoid dessert due to his grandmother's diabetes. He says he is out of money because he bought dessert daily and spent $30 instead of $20. He says he is "starving." There is no food in the house besides the fruits, vegetables, and frozen meals his mother provided. Which of the following would be an appropriate response of the emergency department health providers?): The child should be given food, and the grandmother should be contacted. Additionally, while there may not be reasonable cause to suspect child abuse, the PA CPSL prescribes that a person, hospital, institution, school, facility, agency, or agency employee acting in good faith shall have immunity from civil and criminal liability that might otherwise result from making a report of suspected child abuse or making a referral for general protective services, regardless of whether the report is required to be made under the PA CPSL. General concerns for a child's safety, health, and well-being may be reported to ChildLine for assessment of services and support.
Document 12 (Title: [Acute hepatic insufficiency disclosing congenital syphilis].): A breast-fed boy, born to first-cousin parents, had been vomiting since birth; his general condition remained good until age 6 weeks when vomiting became more frequent, and his status suddenly worsened, with polypnea, shock, hypothermia, jaundice, presence of blood in urine, gastric juice, stool, and bleeding tendency during veno-punctures. There was an huge hepatomegaly and a splenomegaly. Hypoglycaemia, metabolic acidosis, severe blood coagulation disturbances, elevated liver enzymes, hypoalbuminemia, pointed to an acute liver failure. He was resuscitated with current supportive measures, and was given a wide spectrum antibiotherapy. Because serologic tests for syphilis were positive in the child and his mother, including the presence of specific IgM the infant was then given Penicillin G therapy only, which resulted in a complete recovery. One month later, a needle liver biopsy showed residual signs of hepatitis. Other possible infectious or metabolic causes of acute liver failure occurring early in life had been excluded.
Document 13 (Title: Early mother-infant reciprocity.): By three weeks of age, the human neonate demonstrates behaviours which are quite different with an object and with a human interactant. He also demonstrates an expectancy for interaction with his caregiver which has clearly defined limits, as demonstrated behaviourally. In microanalysis of videotape, we saw regularly a set of interactive behaviours which were demonstrable in optimal face-to-face interaction between infants and their mothers. All parts of the infant's body move in smooth circular patterns as he attends to her. His face-to-face attention to her is rhythmic with approach-withdrawal cycling of extremities. The attention phase and build-up to her cues are followed by turning away and a recovery phase in a rhythm of attention-non-attention which seems to define a cyclical homeostatic curve of attention, averaging several cycles per minute. When she violates his expectancy for rhythmic interaction by presenting a still, unresponsive face to him, he becomes visibly concerned, his movements become jerky, he averts his face, then attempts to draw her into interaction. When repeated attempts fail, he finally withdraws into an attitude of helplessness, face averted, body curled up and motionless. If she returns to her usual interactive responses, he comes alive after an initial puzzled period, and returns to his rhythmic cyclical behaviour which has previously characterized their ongoing face-to-face interaction. This attentional cycling may be diagnostic of optimal mother-infant interactions and seems not to be present in more disturbed interactions.
Document 14 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): A 21-year-old woman comes with her parents to discuss therapeutic options for her Crohn’s disease. She was diag-nosed with Crohn’s disease 2 years ago, and it involves her terminal ileum and proximal colon, as confirmed by colonoscopy and small bowel radiography. She was initially treated with mesalamine and budesonide with good response, but over the last 2 months, she has had a relapse of her symptoms. She is experiencing fatigue, cramping, abdominal pains, and nonbloody diarrhea up to 10 times daily, and she has had a 15-lb weight loss. She has no other significant medical or surgical his-tory. Her current medications are mesalamine 2.4 g/d and budesonide 9 mg/d. She appears thin and tired. Abdominal examination reveals tenderness without guarding in the right lower quadrant; no masses are palpable. On perianal examination, there is no tenderness, fissure, or fistula. Her laboratory data are notable for anemia and elevated C-reactive protein. What are the options for immediate
Document 15 (Title: [Zinc in the treatment of hepatolenticular degeneration: report of 3 cases].): Three patients with symptoms and signs of hepatolenticular degeneration (HLD) who developed serious renal side effects of D-penicillamine (DP) had their therapeutic schedule changed to zinc. Patient 1, a 55 year-old man had been well until 12 years old, when skeletal changes (osteomalacia) due to tubular renal disturbance began. His diagnosis of HLD had first been established at age of 32 when he presented with "wing-beat" tremor. He was then begun on DP and his neurological symptoms resolved within one year of initiating therapy but skeletal abnormalities remained unchanged as a sequel. During the next 22 years the patient was continued on DP therapy but with poor compliance. Then the reappearance of his neurological manifestations occurred several times. By the age of 53, after one year without therapy, his neurological status has worse. DP was reinstituted but some weeks later his renal laboratory parameters became severely affected. DP was discontinued and zinc sulfate (220 mg three times daily) was introduced. On this therapeutic regimen his renal laboratory parameters returned to previous level after one month. Within one year on this therapeutic regimen neurological manifestations were resolved. After 31 months on zinc treatment he remains neurologically asymptomatic and his renal function is satisfactory. Patient 2, a 41 year old woman had been her diagnosis of HLD at age of 20, when following the diagnosis of the disease in her old brother, she was found to have the laboratory features of HLD and bilateral Kayser-Fleischer rings. DP treatment was recommended at that time but she quit the follow-up. When she was 23, an esophageal variceal bleeding occurred.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
Question: A mother brings her 3-week-old infant to the pediatrician's office because she is concerned about his feeding habits.
