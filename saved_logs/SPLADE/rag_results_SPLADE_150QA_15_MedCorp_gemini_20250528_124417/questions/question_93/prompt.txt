Document 1 (Title: EMS Tactical Care and Evacuation Under Fire -- Issues of Concern -- Care): The WARM ZONE (Tactical Field Care) is the area in which there is still potential for danger, but the threat is not immediate. It may be referred to as the Yellow Zone or Tactical Field Care. In this zone, the TEMS provider must weigh the risks of evacuation with delayed medical intervention versus remaining in an area where danger still exists to provide immediate care. The COOL ZONE is the area where no imminent danger exists. It may also be referred to as the Green Zone or Tac-Evac.
Document 2 (Title: [Evolution and treatment of 8 patients with Fournier's perineal-scrotal gangrene].): The authors present eight cases of Fournier's gangrene treated from 1987 to 1989 (3 years). There was no discernable cause for 5 patients (62.5%). Immediate aggressive surgical debridement of all necrotic tissue was performed. Intravenous antibiotics and resuscitation fluid and hyperbaric oxygenation were also administered to all patients. Skin grafting was performed for 4 patients (40%), 3 weeks after surgical debridement. One patient died (12.5%) and 2 subsequently developed an urethral stricture. Etiology, treatment and outcome of Fournier's gangrene are discussed and the results of the study are compared to other studies. This disease is still serious, its pathogenesis is not completely elucidated, but when immediate adequate treatment is performed, the outcome is generally favourable.
Document 3 (Title: Fournier's gangrene complicating perinal abscess: report of two cases.): Two cases of Fournier's gangrene in which toxemia and gangrene of the scrotum developed due to perianal abscesses are described. Cultures of anaerobic gram-negative Bacteroides with a mixed flora of Pseudomonas, E. coli and Proteus were obtained. Early diagnosis, wide and deep incisions, debridement of the necrotic tissue, and adequate antibiotic therapy can prevent a fatal outcome of this disease. A high mortality rate is still prevalent.
Document 4 (Title: Cell_Biology_Alberts): As we have emphasized, the genetic instability of cancer cells makes the cells both dangerous and vulnerable—dangerous because of the enhancement in their ability to evolve and proliferate, and vulnerable because treatment that leads to still more extreme genetic disruption can take them over the brink and kill them. In some cancers, genetic instability results from an identified fault in one of the many devices on which normal cells depend for DNA repair and maintenance. In this case, a drug is tailored to block a complementary part of the DNA repair machinery can lead to such severe genetic damage that the cancer cells die.
Document 5 (Title: Psichiatry_DSM-5): Genetic and physiological. Behavioral disinhibition is a highly heritable general propensity to not constrain behavior in socially acceptable ways, to break social norms and rules, and to take dangerous risks, pursuing rewards excessively despite dangers of adverse consequences. Youths with strong behavioral disinhibition show risk factors for inhalant use disorder: early- onset substance use disorder, multiple substance involvement, and early conduct problems. Because behavioral disinhibition is under strong genetic inﬂuence, youths in families with substance and antisocial problems are at elevated risk for inhalant use disorder. Certain native or aboriginal communities have experienced a high prevalence of inhalant problems. Also, in some countries, groups of homeless children in street gangs have ex- tensive inhalant use problems. Although the prevalence of inhalant use disorder is almost identical in adolescent males and females, the disorder is very rare among adult females.
Document 6 (Title: EMS Gaining Access and Extrication -- Issues of Concern): Scenes not involving car crashes and roads still have the potential for danger, so crews should never let their guard down. EMS should consider violent patients, family members, and bystanders. Teams should never enter a scene that is not secure or has the potential for violence until law enforcement has ensured safety. Still, other dangers exist and must be considered, including chemical hazards such as carbon monoxide.
Document 7 (Title: [Fournier's gangrene: report of 3 cases].): Fournier's gangrene is defined classically as a fulminant, rapidly spreading infection of the scrotum that also involves the perineum, penis and abdominal wall. The pathologic findings are described as synergistic gangrene secondary to a polymicrobial flora with a poorly defined portal of entry. We report 3 cases of Fournier's gangrene. Case 1 was a 67 years old who was admitted with the chief complaint of scrotal swelling and necrosis. Case 2 was a 59 years old who was admitted with the problem of scrotal swelling and pain, he had sought other medical help without success, and was then transferred to our hospital. Case 3 was a 62 years old who was admitted with the chief complaint of scrotal swelling and pain for 2 days. These 3 patients were all found to have diabetes mellitus. All 3 patients required aggressive surgical debridement, broad-spectrum antibiotics and adjunctive measures. Blood cultures were usually negative and pus cultures were typically aerobic gram-negative rods and gram-positive cocci and anaerobic bacteria of various types, especially Bacteroids fragilis. Our pus cultures revealed Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus in Case 1, Enterobacter cloacae in Case 2 and E. coli, B. fragilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in Case 3. This disease is no longer a disease of young men. After 1945, the average age in 119 reported cases was 51.3 years and the average age of our cases was 62.7 years. Before the era of antibiotics, scrotal gangrene was not a rarity. In these modern times, in spite of seeking medical attention early, patients still developed scrotal gangrene and the mortality rate is high.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Document 8 (Title: Fournier gangrene): Fournier gangrene is a recognized side effect of SGLT2 inhibitors (canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and empagliflozin), which increase the excretion of glucose in the urine. Diagnosis Fournier gangrene is usually diagnosed clinically, but laboratory tests and imaging studies are used to confirm diagnosis, determine severity, and predict outcomes. X-rays and ultrasounds may show the presence of gas below the surface of the skin. A CT scan can be useful in determining the site of origin and extent of spread.
Document 9 (Title: Gynecology_Novak): Legal Issues The privilege of patients to keep their records or medical information private can be superseded by the needs of society, but only in rare circumstances. The classic legal decision quoted for the needs of others superseding individual patient rights is that of Tarasoff v. Regents of the University of California (18). That decision establishes that the special relationship between a patient and doctor may support affirmative duties for the benefit of third persons. It requires disclosure if “necessary to avert danger to others” but still in a fashion “that would preserve the privacy of the patient to the fullest extent compatible with the prevention of the threatened danger.” This principle is compatible with the various codes of ethics that allow physicians to reveal information to protect the welfare of the individual or the community. In other words, “the protective privilege ends where the public peril begins” (18).
Document 10 (Title: Necrotizing fasciitis): "crepitant cellulitis", "gangrenous cellulitis", "Meleney cellulitis", "necrotizing synergistic cellulitis", "hemolytic streptococcal gangrene", "progressive bacterial synergistic gangrene", "necrotizing abscess", "galloping gangrene", or "hospital gangrene". Later, "hospital gangrene" became more commonly used. In 1871 Confederate States Army surgeon Joseph Jones reported 2,642 cases of hospital gangrene with a mortality rate of 46%. In 1883, Dr Jean-Alfred Fournier described the necrotizing infection of the perineum and scrotum, now called Fournier gangrene. The term "necrotizing fasciitis" was first coined by Wilson in 1952. Its definition has become broader, to include not only infection of fascia, but also other soft-tissue infection. Despite being disfavored by the medical community, the term "galloping gangrene" is frequently used in sensationalistic news media to refer to outbreaks of necrotizing fasciitis.
Document 11 (Title: Psichiatry_DSM-5): tent, including persecutory ideas of reference. The individual may have a guarded, distrust- ful attitude. When the delusions are moderate in severity, the individual views others as untrustworthy and may be hypervigilant or sense ill will in others. When the delusions are severe but still within the attenuated range, the individual entertains loosely organized be- liefs about danger or hostile intention, but the delusions do not have the fixed nature that is necessary for the diagnosis of a psychotic disorder. Guarded behavior in the interview can interfere with the ability to gather information. Reality testing and perspective can be elic- ited with nonconfirming evidence, but the propensity for viewing the world as hostile and dangerous remains strong. Attenuated delusions may have grandiose content presenting as an unrealistic sense of superior capacity. When the delusions are moderate, the individual harbors notions of being gifted, inﬂuential, or special. When the delusions are
Document 12 (Title: Cao Ren): Chen Jiao (陳矯), turned pale when he saw the situation from the top of the city walls. However, unlike what everyone thought, Niu Jin managed to create havoc around the Wu's army with just 100 men left by then. Cao Ren experienced a surge of fury and courage after watching how Niu Jin with so little men could make the entire Wu army three times the strength get so tired battling just 300 of his own men, so he ordered every troop in the city to be prepared to go into battle. Chen Jiao and the others attempted to dissuade him from braving danger, but Cao Ren ignored them and every soldiers in his command was ordered to charged into the enemy formation. Cao Ren successfully rescued Niu Jin and his surviving men and even turned back to save his remaining soldiers who were still trapped in the enemy formation. Sun Quan's forces retreated. When Cao Ren returned, his subordinates exclaimed, "General, you're truly a man from Heaven!" The troops were awed by Cao Ren's bravery, and Cao Cao was
Document 13 (Title: Fournier gangrene): Cause Most cases of Fournier gangrene are infected with both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria such as Clostridium perfringens. It can also result from infections caused by group A streptococcus (GAS), as well as other pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus and Vibrio vulnificus. Lack of access to sanitation, medical care, and psychosocial resources has been linked to increased mortality. A 2006 Turkish study reported that blood sugar levels were elevated in 46 percent of patients diagnosed with Fourniers. Another study reported that about one third of patients were alcoholic, diabetic, and malnourished, while another ten percent had been immunosuppressed through chemotherapy, steroids, or malignancy. Fournier gangrene is a recognized side effect of SGLT2 inhibitors (canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and empagliflozin), which increase the excretion of glucose in the urine.
Document 14 (Title: Fournier gangrene): Fournier gangrene is a type of necrotizing fasciitis or gangrene affecting the external genitalia or perineum. It commonly occurs in older men, but it can also occur in women and children. It is more likely to occur in diabetics, alcoholics, or those who are immunocompromised. About one per 62,500 males are affected per year. Males are affected about 40 times more often than females. It was first described by Baurienne in 1764 and is named after a French venereologist, Jean Alfred Fournier, following five cases he presented in clinical lectures in 1883.
Document 15 (Title: Human Trafficking -- Evaluation -- Safety): The NHTRC can assist you in threat level assessment, danger risk, and contacting law enforcement if the patient consents.
