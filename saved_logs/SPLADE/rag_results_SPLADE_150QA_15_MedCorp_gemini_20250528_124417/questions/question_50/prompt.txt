Document 1 (Title: Carol Hathaway): Carol has a difficult pregnancy. She becomes dizzy and nearly passes out from low blood pressure. Her labor is equally difficult, with Carol collapsing on the staircase of the El train and then suffering from dangerous bleeding during delivery. Despite the problems, Carol delivers Tess and Kate Ross on Thanksgiving Day assisted by then-OB nurse Abby Lockhart with long-time friend and colleague Dr. Mark Greene as her birthing coach. When Doug learns of his twin daughters' birth via a telephone call, he again invites them to come and live with him in Seattle. Carol cannot decide if it is the right thing to do; she is still hurt over his abrupt departure a year earlier. She attempts to raise their daughters alone. After the birth of the twins, Carol struggles to balance child-rearing, her postpartum emotions, and her return to work. She also tells Mark that she knows the girls deserve a father. Mark then says that Doug has been seeing them, implying plane visits off-screen.
Document 2 (Title: Root Cause Analysis and Medical Error Prevention -- Function -- Case example 1): A 42-year-old primigravida woman at 34 weeks gestation was brought to the obstetric emergency department at midnight with complaints of severe headache, blurry vision, and right upper quadrant pain for the last 5 to 6 hours. She noted lower extremity edema and facial swelling that was gradually increasing. She has gestational hypertension and, 1 week ago, was prescribed labetalol 200 mg twice a day. On initial presentation, her blood pressure was 190/110 mm Hg on 2 separate occasions, 5 minutes apart. She had gained 2 kilograms since her last antenatal checkup in the clinic a week ago. The patient was diagnosed with severe preeclampsia. The senior obstetric resident ordered a loading dose of magnesium sulfate to prevent imminent seizure. The hospital protocol used an intravenous (IV) and intramuscular (IM) regimen where the patient received a 4 g IV bolus and a 10 g IM dose administered as 5 g in each buttock. The senior resident gave verbal orders for magnesium sulfate administration to the junior resident, who verbally communicated the order to the nurse.
Document 3 (Title: [A case of progressive systemic sclerosis associated with a hemorrhagic infarction of the cerebellum].): Central nervous system is rarely involved in progressive systemic sclerosis (PSS) unless there are concomitant abnormalities in renal or lung function or hypertension. A 72-year-old woman with typical PSS developed cerebellar bleeding. Medical history records revealed, she had noted the onset of Raynaud's sign on her upper extremities at the age of 37. This was followed by necrosis and repeated infection, and as a result, shortening of her fingers in her 40's. The disease progressed and involved lower extremities, and then face and body in her 50's. Aortic valve stenosis was diagnosed at 69 year old, cardiac myopathy at 70 and at the age of 71 infectious dermatitis in both inguinal regions. Mild anemia, hypoalbuminemia and the decrease of serum Fe were discovered in June 1988. At the same time, prolonged ESR, positive C-reactive protein, RA, and anti-nuclear-antibody were also noticed. A chest roentgenogram revealed pulmonary fibrosis. Systemic hypertension was not noticed on the clinical course. She developed an onset of vertigo and vomiting in the morning of August 8, 1988. Consequently, she was brought to our hospital. She was alert but a physical examination showed a swallowing disturbance, dysarthria, right cerebellar ataxia, nystagmus and hypertension (192/100 mmHg). A CT examination on admission revealed a slightly low density area in right cerebellar hemisphere without mass effect. She was treated with dextran and mannitol and her condition improved on the 6th day of her admission. She was alert and blood pressure calm down to 120/70 mmHg without the use of anti-hypertension drugs on August 21.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Document 4 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): A 21-year-old woman comes with her parents to discuss therapeutic options for her Crohn’s disease. She was diag-nosed with Crohn’s disease 2 years ago, and it involves her terminal ileum and proximal colon, as confirmed by colonoscopy and small bowel radiography. She was initially treated with mesalamine and budesonide with good response, but over the last 2 months, she has had a relapse of her symptoms. She is experiencing fatigue, cramping, abdominal pains, and nonbloody diarrhea up to 10 times daily, and she has had a 15-lb weight loss. She has no other significant medical or surgical his-tory. Her current medications are mesalamine 2.4 g/d and budesonide 9 mg/d. She appears thin and tired. Abdominal examination reveals tenderness without guarding in the right lower quadrant; no masses are palpable. On perianal examination, there is no tenderness, fissure, or fistula. Her laboratory data are notable for anemia and elevated C-reactive protein. What are the options for immediate
Document 5 (Title: Pharmacogenomics): Case B – Pain Management Patient B is a woman who gave birth by caesarian section. Her physician prescribed codeine for post-caesarian pain. She took the standard prescribed dose, however experienced nausea and dizziness while she was taking codeine. She also noticed that her breastfed infant was lethargic and feeding poorly. When the patient mentioned these symptoms to her physician, they recommended that she discontinue codeine use. Within a few days, both the patient and her infant's symptoms were no longer present. It is assumed that if the patient underwent a pharmacogenomic test, it would have revealed she may have had a duplication of the gene CYP2D6 placing her in the Ultra-rapid metabolizer (UM) category, explaining her ADRs to codeine use. Case C – FDA Warning on Codeine Overdose for Infants
Document 6 (Title: Biochemistry_Lippinco): Patient Presentation: BE is a 45-year-old woman who presents with concerns about sudden (paroxysmal), intense, brief episodes of headache, sweating (diaphoresis), and a racing heart (palpitations). Focused History: BE reports that the attacks started ~3 weeks ago. They last from 2 to 10 minutes, during which time she feels quite anxious. During the attacks, it feels as though her heart is skipping beats (arrhythmia). At first, she thought the attacks were related to recent stress at work and maybe even menopause. The last time it happened, she was in a pharmacy and had her blood pressure taken. She was told it was 165/110 mm Hg. BE notes that she has lost weight (~8 lbs) in this period even though her appetite has been good.
Document 7 (Title: [A case of two successful deliveries by a woman with Kallmann syndrome and NIDDM].): A 37 year-old female with Kallmann syndrome and NIDDM who had two successful deliveries is reported. She had experienced no menstruation until she had treatment with gestagen in her early twenties. She had withdrawal bleeding only once. At the age of 25, she consulted her family doctor, complaining of amenorrhea. Estrogen progesterone cyclic therapy caused withdrawal bleeding, and clomiphene citrate failed to induce apparent ovulation. In January 1978, 150 IU of hMG was administered daily for 9 days, and then 3000 IU of hCG daily for the following 2 days. This therapy induced pregnancy, which failed spontaneously on June 4th. A year later, in January 1979, 150 IU of hMG was again administered daily for 7 days followed by 6000 IU of hCG for 3 days. This therapy again induced pregnancy. On September 27th, 1979, she delivered a girl vaginally, weighing 3830 g. After this delivery, she experienced no menstruation. In June 1985, she consulted her family doctor again, and she was diagnosed as being pregnant. Since her fasting blood glucose was 145 mg/dl, she was admitted to Kosei Hospital to control her blood glucose. On October 15th, she delivered a girl weighing 2600 g. On June 13th, 1989, she was referred to Kosei Hospital by her family doctor to achieve an accurate control of her blood glucose. During this admission, she was diagnosed as having Kallmann syndrome because of congenital anosmia and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism without any abnormal morphological changes. Vitamin B1 infusion test was negative.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Document 8 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): JP is a 33-year-old woman who presents with complaints of fatigue requiring daytime naps, weight gain, cold intoler-ance, and muscle weakness for the last few months. These complaints are new since she used to always feel “hot,” noted difficulty sleeping, and could eat anything that she wanted without gaining weight. She also would like to become preg-nant in the near future. Because of poor medication adherence to methimazole and propranolol, she received radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy, developed hypothyroidism, and was started on levothyroxine 100 mcg daily. Other medications include calcium carbonate three times daily to “protect her bones” and omeprazole for “heartburn.” On physical exami-nation, her blood pressure is 130/89 mm Hg with a pulse of 50 bpm. Her weight is 136 lb (61.8 kg), an increase of 10 lb (4.5 kg) in the last year. Her thyroid gland is not palpable and her reflexes are delayed. Laboratory findings include a thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level of 24.9 μIU/mL
Document 9 (Title: Biochemistry_Lippinco): 3.3. A 39-year-old woman is brought to the emergency room complaining of weakness and dizziness. She recalls getting up early that morning to do her weekly errands and had skipped breakfast. She drank a cup of coffee for lunch and had nothing to eat during the day. She met with friends at 8 p.m. and had a few drinks. As the evening progressed, she soon became weak and dizzy and was taken to the hospital. Laboratory tests revealed her blood glucose to be 45 mg/dl (normal = 70–99). She was given orange juice and immediately felt better. The biochemical basis of her alcohol-induced hypoglycemia is an increase in: A. fatty acid oxidation. B. the ratio of the reduced oxidized forms of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. C. oxaloacetate and pyruvate. D. use of acetyl coenzyme A in fatty acid synthesis.
Document 10 (Title: Tennessee Controlled Substance Prescribing for Acute and Chronic Pain -- Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes -- CC: Request For Increased Pain Medicine): A 76-year-old patient presents to the pharmacy to fill a prescription for acetaminophen and codeine. The pharmacist asks if this is a new prescription. The patient says she has been on it for months ever since she tripped over her hungry cat between her legs and broke her back. The patient says she recently moved from her own home to live with her daughter just down the street from the pharmacy.
Document 11 (Title: Kentucky KASPER and Controlled Substance Prescribing -- Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes -- CC: Request For Increased Pain Medicine): A 76-year-old patient presents to the pharmacy to fill a prescription for acetaminophen and codeine. The pharmacist asks if this is a new prescription. The patient says she has been on it for months ever since she tripped over her hungry cat between her legs and broke her back. The patient says she recently moved from her own home to live with her daughter just down the street from the pharmacy.
Document 12 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): Her social history is significant for alcohol use (three to four glasses of wine/night). Her vital signs include the following: temperature 99.8°F, blood pressure 132/64 mm Hg, pulse 78 bpm, and respiratory rate 15/min. On physical examination, she had left upper abdominal tenderness with evidence of hepatomegaly and mild scleral icterus. Laboratory data revealed the following: alanine aminotransferase, 527 IU/L (normal 10–35 IU/L); aspartate aminotransferase, 425 IU/L (normal < 35 IU/L); and bilirubin, 2.9 mg/dL (normal 0.1–0.3 mg/dL). What medications do OTC cold and flu preparations typically contain? Which of the OTC medications might have contrib-uted to the patient’s current symptoms? KH, a 55-year-old woman, presents to the emergency department with nausea, vomiting, and complaints of new-onset flu symptoms over the past several days. Her past medical history is significant for allergic rhinitis and chronic lower back pain secondary to a work-related fall 2 years ago. Her
Document 13 (Title: [Chronic interstitial nephritis caused by analgesics].): Interstitial nephritis secondary to analgesic ingestion is apparently an uncommon subject in pediatric literature. Two cases are reported in this article: case 1 is a girl followed for the last fifteen years when she had lipoid nephrosis which was treated initially with corticosteroids; she responded satisfactorily, but presented frequent relapses. After 8 years, she was given cyclophosphamide plus prednisone and lately, she responded and has remained well. Further on, her urinalysis showed specific gravity of 1,033 and no proteinuria. Five years ago, because of protracted headache due to psychological disturbance, she started to ingest a variety of analgesics in progressively increasing doses. For the last 2 years, abdominal pains, paleness, polydipsia and polyuria have been observed; at present, her blood pressure, serum chemistry, and urine sediment are normal, but there is a marked failure in the renal concentration capacity, as well as marked sodium urinary losses. A percutaneous renal biopsy showed tubulo-interstitial fibrosis and edema with normal glomeruli. Case 2 is a girl with rheumatoid arthritis which appeared 3 years ago; for over one year, the patient was given 15 mg/day prednisone plus 1.5 g. acetylsalycilic acid. She was admitted to the hospital because her osteoarticular problem did not improve. Her blood pressure, blood chemistries and urinary sediment were also normal. LE tests were negative. Renal concentrating capacity was reduced and the renal biopsy showed tubular atrophy; there was intestinal edema and mononuclear infiltration. Chronic interstitial nephritis, secondary to analgesics is supported in both cases; polyuria and a marked defect of renal concentrating capacity are the earliest and most characteristic features. Normal urinary sediment is a common finding leading to erroneous assessment of a lack of renal involvement. Pathological lesions are located in the interstice of the renal medulla and sometimes in the papilla. Early arrest of analgesic ingestion may stop and even reverse the renal lesion and the renal insufficiency.
Document 14 (Title: Tennessee Controlled Substance Prescribing for Acute and Chronic Pain -- Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes -- Work-up): The patient is given naloxone and becomes awake and conversant. She admits that she was sitting on the toilet urinating, and the last thing she remembers is feeling faint. She indicates that she has difficulty sleeping and walking due to chronic hip pain, and she has severe pain with exercise in their home pool. She denies suicidal ideation. She admits to taking an extra pain pill and “smoking a joint” prior to the episode. Checking PDMP reveals she has been on a three times a day dose of her oxycodone and acetaminophen for the last six weeks prescribed by her orthopedic surgeon.
