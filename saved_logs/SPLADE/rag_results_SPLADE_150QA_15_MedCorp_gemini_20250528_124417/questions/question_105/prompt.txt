Document 1 (Title: Paget's disease of bone): Diagnosis The first clinical manifestation of Paget's disease is usually an elevated alkaline phosphatase in the blood. Paget's disease may be diagnosed using one or more of the following tests: Pagetic bone has a characteristic appearance on X-rays. A skeletal survey is therefore indicated. An elevated level of alkaline phosphatase in the blood in combination with normal calcium, phosphate, and aminotransferase levels in an elderly patient are suggestive of Paget's disease. Markers of bone turnover in urine eg. Pyridinoline Elevated levels of serum and urinary hydroxyproline are also found. Bone scans are useful in determining the extent and activity of the condition. If a bone scan suggests Paget's disease, the affected bone(s) should be X-rayed to confirm the diagnosis. Differential diagnosis
Document 2 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): Since bone and kidney play central roles in bone mineral homeostasis, conditions that alter bone mineral homeostasis usually affect one or both of these tissues secondarily. Effects on bone can result in osteoporosis (abnormal loss of bone; remaining bone histologically normal), osteomalacia (abnormal bone formation due to inadequate mineralization), or osteitis fibrosa (excessive bone resorption with fibrotic replacement of resorption cavities and marrow). Biochemical markers of skeletal involvement include changes in serum levels of the skeletal isoenzyme of alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, and Nand C-terminal propeptides of type I collagen (reflecting osteoblastic activity), and serum and urine levels of tartrateresistant acid phosphatase and collagen breakdown products (reflecting osteoclastic activity). The kidney becomes involved when the calcium × phosphate product in serum rises above the point at which ectopic calcification occurs (nephrocalcinosis) or when the calcium ×
Document 3 (Title: Acid Phosphatase -- Clinical Significance -- Acid Phosphatase as a Marker): Bone tissue is a dynamic structure that is continuously formed and resorbed in a balanced process. Osteoclasts, the cells responsible for bone resorption, express another acid phosphatase isoform. Indeed, several studies have shown that acid phosphatase is directly involved in bone resorption. Bone acid phosphatase differs from prostatic acid phosphatase in being a tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase. In osteoporosis, the most common bone disease in humans, the resorption/formation balance becomes disrupted in favor of resorption. Several serum markers for bone resorption have been proposed, such as urinary hydroxyproline, total urinary pyridinoline, and bone sialoprotein. Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase is precise, resistant to hemolysis, and shows minimal day-to-day variability, making it a potential marker for monitoring therapy response, though it is still under development. In addition, agents that inhibit tartrate-resistant acid phosphatases, such as fluoride, have been shown to improve and even reverse osteoporosis cases. [4] [5]
Document 4 (Title: [Usefulness of bone remodelling biochemical markers in the diagnosis and follow-up of Paget's bone disease, primary hyperparathyroidism, tumor hypercalcemia, and postmenopausal osteoporosis. II. Bone resorption markers].): Rapid detection of the exact changes in bone remodelling is exceptionally important. In this paper, the latest bone remodelling biochemical markers are reviewed. Some of them have already been used for a long time, and their utility has been widely demonstrated. The newest ones, in experimental stage, can be used as a complement to the others. The bone remodelling markers reviewed are: 1) Alkaline phosphatase; 2) osteocalcin; 3) other noncollagen of bone matrix such as osteonectin, GLA-protein of the matrix, osteopontine and alpha 2-HS-glycoprotein; 4) Procollagenous and other collagenous peptides of the matrix (C terminal of type I procollagen and urinary elimination of non-dialysis hydroxyproline. Amongst the bone resorption markers studied are: 1) Calcium/creatinine urinary quotient; 2) Tartrate resistant acid phosphatase; 3) Urinary hydroxyproline; 4) Other substance derived from collagen disruption such as hydroxylysine glycoside, piridinolinic intermolecular bridges and the enzymatic activity of proline iminopeptidase. We endeavored to collect all the most important references on the matter, especially those relating to Paget's disease of the bone, primary hyperparathyroidism, tumoral hypercalcemia and postmenopausal osteoporosis.
Document 5 (Title: Biochemical Markers of Osteoporosis -- Introduction -- Bone Turnover Biomarkers): Bone turnover markers (BTMs) are byproducts of the bone remodeling process and can be measured in urine or serum. BTMs are categorized as markers of bone formation or bone resorption. Markers of bone formation include total and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (ALP), procollagen type 1 N-propeptide (P1NP), osteocalcin, and procollagen type 1 C-propeptide (P1CP). Markers of bone resorption include hydroxyproline, pyridinoline, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b, deoxypyridinoline, the carboxy-terminal cross-linked telopeptide of type 1 collagen (CTX-1), and the amino-terminal cross-linked telopeptide of type 1 collagen (NTX-1). [11] [12]
Document 6 (Title: Clinical usefulness of serum tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase in Paget's disease of bone: correlation with other biochemical markers of bone remodelling.): Tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) has been proposed as a new biochemical marker for bone resorption. We have compared this new marker, TRAP, with the classical biochemical markers of bone remodelling, serum alkaline phosphatase (sAP), serum osteocalcin (sBGP), and with the urinary hydroxyproline/creatinine ratio (uOHProl/creatinine), a routine marker of bone resorption. Serum TRAP was significantly higher in pagetic patients (n = 43) than in control subjects (n = 12) (13.02 +/- 4.7 vs 5.48 +/- 1.31 IU/L, P less than 0.001) and a significantly positive linear correlation was found between the sTRAP and uOHProl/creatinine ratio (y = 0.0051x - 0.0069, r = 0.82, P less than 0.001), between sTRAP and sAP (y = 19.3x - 85.0, r = 0.71, P less than 0.001) and also between sTRAP and sBGP (y = 0.02x + 2.23, r = 0.52, P less than 0.01). Serum TRAP levels were higher than the upper limit of normality in all our pagetic patients except for two, whose uOHProl/creatinine levels were in the normal range. We conclude that (1) sTRAP could be a parameter as sensitive as uOHProl/creatinine in the diagnosis of Paget's disease; (2) sTRAP and uOHProl/creatinine are both good markers of bone resorption; (3) the correlation found between sTRAP and formation markers (sAP and sBGP) makes sTRAP a marker of disease activity in Paget's disease of bone; (4) the assay of sTRAP is easier, faster, and of lower cost than the urinary hydroxyproline determination. We suggest that sTRAP determination could be used as a routine marker of bone resorption in Paget's disease of bone, as is the case with uOHProl determination.
Document 7 (Title: Biochemical markers of bone metabolism.): Bone metabolic homeostasis is regulated by a number of hormones and local modulators, and the study of these factors has been of major help in our understanding of bone disease. However, these parameters do not, in a strict sense reflect the metabolic and biochemical changes in the diseased bone tissue. Thus, there is a great interest in the study of biochemical specific "markers" of bone metabolic processes, namely of bone formation and bone resorption. Alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, osteonectin, and procollagen type I propeptides are the currently known markers of bone formation, whereas urinary hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine glycosides, plasma tartrate resistant acid phosphatase, and urinary hydroxy-pyridinium crosslinks of collagen are considered markers of bone resorption. In this paper, we review the background work on each of these markers, and subsequently give an overview of the currently available data on their usefulness in metabolic bone diseases, namely in Paget's disease of bone, primary hyperparathyroidism, osteoporosis, and renal osteodystrophy.
Document 8 (Title: Osteoporosis in Females -- Evaluation -- Imaging): Besides the DEXA scan, other radiological tests could be used to support and differentiate the cause of fracture, including pathological and secondary fractures from malignancies. These include conventional radiography, CT (computed tomography (CT) scans, MRI, and bone scan (scintigraphy). Recently, the use of bone turnover markers was introduced as part of monitoring treatment failures or responses. They are not used in isolation as some results are nonspecific, but they could be helpful in complex patient assessments where DEXA scans alone might not be sufficient for decision making. These include serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and bone-specific ALP. Serum osteocalcin (a specific marker for osteoblastic function), serum type 1 procollagen, or serum carboxy-terminal collagen crosslinks (CTX) (a marker for bone resorption) are used as treatment response markers. [16] Besides these, there are other bone resorption markers like urinary hydroxyproline, urinary pyridinoline, bone sialoprotein, and few others.

Document 11 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): cells have strong expression of CD22, CD25, and CD103; soluble CD25 level in serum is an excellent tumor marker for disease activity. The cells also express tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase. The immunoglobulin genes are
Document 12 (Title: Osteomalacia): Causes The causes of adult osteomalacia are varied, but ultimately result in a vitamin D deficiency: Diagnosis Biochemical findings Biochemical features are similar to those of rickets. The major factor is an abnormally low vitamin D concentration in blood serum. Major typical biochemical findings include: Low serum and urinary calcium Low serum phosphate, except in cases of renal osteodystrophy Elevated serum alkaline phosphatase (due to an increase in compensatory osteoblast activity) Elevated parathyroid hormone (due to low calcium) Furthermore, a technetium bone scan will show increased activity (also due to increased osteoblasts). Radiographic characteristics Radiological appearances include: Pseudofractures, also called Looser's zones. Protrusio acetabuli, a hip joint disorder
Document 13 (Title: Histology, Osteoblasts -- Clinical Significance -- Osteoblast Markers): Many serum biomarkers of osteoblast function exist. These include osteoprotegerin (OPG), receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), bone alkaline phosphatase (B-ALP), osteocalcin, procollagen type 1 carboxy-terminal propeptide (P1CP) and procollagen type 1 amino-terminal propeptide (P1NP). [21] [52] Seldomly are the majority of these markers utilized clinically to measure osteoblast function due to cost, analytical inconsistencies, and undetermined clinical significance. [53] [54] [55] Osteocalcin is the most specific marker for osteoblastic activity. [38]
Document 14 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): Paget’s disease is a localized bone disorder characterized by uncontrolled osteoclastic bone resorption with secondary increases in poorly organized bone formation. The cause of Paget’s disease is obscure, although some studies suggest that a measles-related virus may be involved. The disease is fairly common, although symptomatic bone disease is less common. Recent studies indicate that this infection may produce a factor that increases the stimulation of bone resorption by 1,25(OH)2D. The biochemical parameters of elevated serum alkaline phosphatase and urinary hydroxyproline are useful for diagnosis. Along with the characteristic radiologic and bone scan findings, these biochemical determinations provide good markers by which to follow therapy.
Document 15 (Title: Osteocalcin): Use as a biochemical marker for bone formation As osteocalcin is produced by osteoblasts, it is often used as a marker for the bone formation process. It has been observed that higher serum osteocalcin levels are relatively well correlated with increases in bone mineral density during treatment with anabolic bone formation drugs for osteoporosis, such as teriparatide. In many studies, osteocalcin is used as a preliminary biomarker on the effectiveness of a given drug on bone formation. For instance, one study which aimed to study the effectiveness of a glycoprotein called lactoferrin on bone formation used osteocalcin as a measure of osteoblast activity.
