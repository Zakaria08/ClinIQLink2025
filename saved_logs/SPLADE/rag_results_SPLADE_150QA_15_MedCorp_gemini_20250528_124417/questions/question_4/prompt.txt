Document 1 (Title: Pulmonary edema): Pulmonary edema (PE), also known as pulmonary congestion, is liquid accumulation in the tissue and air spaces of the lungs. It leads to impaired gas exchange and may cause respiratory failure. It is due to either failure of the left ventricle of the heart to remove blood adequately from the pulmonary circulation (cardiogenic pulmonary edema), or an injury to the lung tissue or blood vessels of the lung (non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema). Treatment is focused on three aspects: firstly improving respiratory function, secondly, treating the underlying cause, and thirdly avoiding further damage to the lung. Pulmonary edema, especially when sudden (acute), can lead to respiratory failure or cardiac arrest due to hypoxia. It is a cardinal feature of congestive heart failure. The term edema is from the Greek (oidēma, "swelling"), from οἰδέω (oidéō, "(I) swell").
Document 2 (Title: Case Study: 60-Year-Old Female Presenting With Shortness of Breath (Archived) -- Case Presentation): The patient is a 60-year-old white female presenting to the emergency department with acute onset shortness of breath.  Symptoms began approximately 2 days before and had progressively worsened with no associated, aggravating, or relieving factors noted. She had similar symptoms approximately 1 year ago with an acute, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation requiring hospitalization. She uses BiPAP ventilatory support at night when sleeping and has requested to use this in the emergency department due to shortness of breath and wanting to sleep. She denies fever, chills, cough, wheezing, sputum production, chest pain, palpitations, pressure, abdominal pain, abdominal distension, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.
Document 3 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): The Eicosanoids: Prostaglandins, Thromboxanes, Leukotrienes, & Related Compounds John Hwa, MD, PhD, & Kathleen Martin, PhD* pulmonary pressures, and right ventricular enlargement. Cardiac catheterization confirmed the severely elevated pulmonary pressures. She was commenced on appropri-ate therapies. Which of the eicosanoid agonists have been demonstrated to reduce both morbidity and mortality in patients with such a diagnosis? What are the modes of action? A 40-year-old woman presented to her doctor with a 6-month history of increasing shortness of breath. This was associated with poor appetite and ankle swell-ing. On physical examination, she had elevated jugular venous distention, a soft tricuspid regurgitation murmur, clear lungs, and mild peripheral edema. An echocardio-gram revealed tricuspid regurgitation, severely elevated
Document 4 (Title: [Sudden death due to bilateral pulmonary thromboembolism in a patient with multiple myeloma: an autopsy case report].): We encountered a patient with multiple myeloma who died suddenly, in whom bilateral pulmonary artery thrombosis was found at autopsy. The patient was a 50-year-old woman who had received chemotherapy for multiple myeloma at a local clinic for 4 years, and was transferred to our hospital because of recurrence of multiple myeloma in August 1990. Despite chemotherapy performed after admission, serum globulin level increased and her low back pain worsened, and she was generally restricted to bed. On October 21, she developed sudden dyspnea, became markedly cyanotic, lost consciousness, and then suffered a cardiopulmonary arrest. Autopsy revealed bilateral pulmonary artery thrombosis as well as thrombosis in the pelvic veins. Hyperviscosity due to multiple myeloma and long-term recumbency were the probable causes of pelvic venous thrombosis and subsequent pulmonary artery thrombosis. We report a rare case of bilateral pulmonary artery thrombosis which developed during the course of multiple myeloma and led to sudden death.
Document 5 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): James L. Zehnder, MD and edema and is tender to touch. Oxygen saturation by fingertip pulse oximeter while breathing room air is 87% (normal > 90%). Ultrasound reveals a deep vein thrombosis in the left lower extremity; chest computed tomography scan confirms the presence of pulmonary emboli. Laboratory blood tests indicate elevated d-dimer levels. What therapy is indicated acutely? What are the long-term therapy options? How long should she be treated? Should this indi-vidual use oral contraceptives? A 25-year-old woman presents to the emergency depart-ment complaining of acute onset of shortness of breath and pleuritic pain. She had been in her usual state of health until 2 days prior when she noted that her left leg was swollen and red. Her only medication was oral contraceptives. Family history was significant for a history of “blood clots” in mul-tiple members of the maternal side of her family. Physical examination demonstrates an anxious woman with stable vital signs.

Document 6 (Title: [An autopsy case of untreated systemic lupus erythematosus with death from acute pulmonary hemorrhage].): An autopsy case of SLE died from acute and diffuse pulmonary hemorrhage is presented. A 50 year-old woman with SLE was admitted to our hospital because of high fever, butterfly rash, discoid skin lesions and renal dysfunction. She died from acute respiratory failure before initiation of the therapy with corticosteroid. Autopsy findings revealed a massive acute intrapulmonary hemorrhage. Histological study demonstrated a pulmonary arterial vasculitis with prominent fibrinoid necrosis at muscular pulmonary artery. No remarkable deposit of immunoglobulins and complements was found within the alveolar walls and pulmonary vessels by immunofluorescence and electron microscopy. Renal histology revealed diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis with fibrinoid necrosis, crescent formation and wireloop lesions compatible with type IVb according to the WHO classification. The granular deposit of IgM, C3 and Clq, and electron dense deposit was found by immunofluorescence and by electron microscopy, respectively, in the kidney. The small arteries and veins in other organs, such as liver, spleen, bladder, ovary and rectum also revealed fibrinoid vasculitis. Acute infectious lesion was not observed in any tissue examined. The diffuse pulmonary hemorrhage in SLE could be one of the manifestations of active and severe systemic vasculitis.
Document 7 (Title: [An autopsy case of pulmonary metastasis of cholangiocellular carcinoma associated with marked fibrotic change of the lungs].): An autopsy case of pulmonary metastasis of cholangiocellular carcinoma is presented. A 44-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital because of dyspnea, general fatigue and a sense of abdominal fullness on February 5, 1990. In November 1986, at an other hospital, she had been diagnosed as having diffuse metastatic lung tumor and multiple bone metastases, by transbronchial lung biopsy and other examinations. During the clinical course, she was not received chest irradiation and chemotherapy which induced fibrotic change of lungs. Chest X-ray film on December 21, 1986 showed diffuse nodular shadows in both lung fields. Chest X-ray film on February 4, 1990 showed diffuse reticular shadows with marked shrinkage of lung fields. She died two months after admission. The primary site of the carcinoma was not determined clinically, but was revealed by autopsy to be cholangiocellular carcinoma of the liver, with generalized metastasis. Microscopic findings of the autopsied lung showed markedly increased connective tissue around bronchi and blood vessels, in areas where microtubular adenocarcinoma was scattered. This is a very rare case of pulmonary metastasis of cholangiocellular carcinoma, associated with marked fibrotic change of the lungs during about 3.5 years. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case.
Document 8 (Title: Ortner's syndrome): Aortic dissection More commonly affects the right recurrent laryngeal nerve as the most common type of aortic dissection is type A (Figure 2). Pseudoaneurysm Notable case: A male with long-standing uncontrolled hypertension and hoarseness of voice attributed to life-long smoking was found to have a pseudoaneurysm of the aortic arch which was compressing the LRLN. Pulmonary disease: Pathophysiology: Due to vascular congestion in the lung, the pulmonary artery (Figure 3) becomes dilated and can compress the aorta and the LRLN. Primary pulmonary hypertension Pulmonary emboli Malignancy (pulmonary, mediastinal) Autoimmune: Mixed connective tissue disease Notable case: A young female with a history of mixed connective tissue disease presented with hoarseness of voice and was found to have secondary pulmonary artery hypertension. This was causing right heart enlargement and therefore compression of the LRLN. Idiopathic
Document 9 (Title: Pulmonary Veno-Occlusive Disease -- Etiology): Autoimmune and connective disorders such as systemic sclerosis (SSc) are well-known causes of PAH and pulmonary hypertension from interstitial lung disease (PH-ILD). [24] Recently, PVOD has been hypothesized to be the reason for the treatment-refractory nature of these patients. A study from 2007 compared lung samples from 8 cases (5 autopsy samples and three explant samples after lung transplant) with connective tissue diseases to 29 patients with no history of connective tissue diseases. The study found that 6 out of 8 patients (75%) with connective tissue diseases had histology consistent with PVOD as opposed to 5 out of 29 patients (17.2%) with no connective tissue disease. [24]
Document 10 (Title: Biochemistry_Lippinco): Choose the ONE best answer. .1. A 30-year-old woman of Northern European ancestry presents with progressive dyspnea (shortness of breath). She denies the use of cigarettes. Family history reveals that her sister also has problems with her lungs. Which one of the following etiologies most likely explains this patient’s pulmonary symptoms? A. Deficiency in dietary vitamin C B. Deficiency of α1-antitrypsin C. Deficiency of prolyl hydroxylase D. Decreased elastase activity E. Increased collagenase activity
Document 11 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): A 21-year-old woman comes with her parents to discuss therapeutic options for her Crohn’s disease. She was diag-nosed with Crohn’s disease 2 years ago, and it involves her terminal ileum and proximal colon, as confirmed by colonoscopy and small bowel radiography. She was initially treated with mesalamine and budesonide with good response, but over the last 2 months, she has had a relapse of her symptoms. She is experiencing fatigue, cramping, abdominal pains, and nonbloody diarrhea up to 10 times daily, and she has had a 15-lb weight loss. She has no other significant medical or surgical his-tory. Her current medications are mesalamine 2.4 g/d and budesonide 9 mg/d. She appears thin and tired. Abdominal examination reveals tenderness without guarding in the right lower quadrant; no masses are palpable. On perianal examination, there is no tenderness, fissure, or fistula. Her laboratory data are notable for anemia and elevated C-reactive protein. What are the options for immediate
Document 12 (Title: Virchow Triad -- Definition/Introduction): Virchow sought to explain the causation of pulmonary thromboembolism and theorized that pulmonary arterial embolus arises from peripheral/distant thrombosis. He attempted to explain the mechanism or define the conditions necessary to initiate peripheral clotting and how a thrombus may dislodge from a peripheral vein, travel to the right heart, and enter the pulmonary arterial system. The 3 factors of Virchow's triad include intravascular vessel wall damage, stasis of flow, and a hypercoagulable state. [1] Understanding these factors involved in thrombus formation and subsequent thromboembolic events enables the clinician to stratify risk, direct clinical decision-making regarding treatment, and establish preventative measures. Virchow died from cardiac disease on September 5, 1902, after sustaining a femur fracture. [3] His main contributions to medicine emanated from his observational skills and abilities to accurately deduce cellular processes contributing to health and disease. Many of his observations remain accurate to this day, and scientists are, in many instances, only beginning to unravel the molecular pathways underlying the observations made by this physician nearly 150 years ago.
Document 13 (Title: Granuloma Inguinale -- Epidemiology): Govender et al reported 2 cases where young children were diagnosed with donovanosis with no history of sexual exposure. An 8-month-old female presented with a right ear mass and discharge. She was initially treated with antibiotics and surgical resection but did not follow up for 8 months. When she presented again, she was found to have progressed in symptomatology and had a new right temporal lobe abscess. She required a craniectomy to drain the abscess, as well as a mastoidectomy. Tissue was removed during the surgery for analysis, and the diagnosis of granuloma inguinale was made. Questioning of the parents revealed no signs or symptoms of sexual abuse. No gynecological exam was performed on the patient’s mother, so it is unknown if she had a genital ulcer. The patient was treated with erythromycin with noted improvement in the right temporal lobe lesion noted on computed tomography before discharge. The patient and her family were unavailable for follow-up after discharge. [2]
Document 14 (Title: [A case of rapidly progressive pulmonary pulmonary hypertension in a 14-year-old girl].): A 14-year-old girl was admitted with chief complaints of edema and chest pain. She had hepatomegaly, but did not have heart murmur and accentuation of the pulmonary component of the second heart sound. The electrocardiogram showed right axis deviation, negative T wave in V3,4 and ST depression in III, aVF. But right ventricular hypertrophy was not dominant. Chest radiography showed a cardiothoracic ratio of 54% and a slight prominence of proximal pulmonary arteries. The edema was soon diminished only by the diuretics, but it appeared again without the diuretics. At the cardiac catheterization 3 months after the onset of symptoms, the pulmonary arterial pressure was 150/85 mmHg and the pulmonary resistance was 3,232 dyn/sec/cm5. The right atrial pressure was 9.5 mmHg and oxygen saturation at the pulmonary artery was 31.0%. Prostaglandin E1 reduced the pulmonary artery pressure only a little, but raised the systemic pressure. The patient was treated with several vasodilators, but her condition deteriorated rapidly and she developed severe right ventricular failure. She died only 8 months after the onset of symptoms and 5 months after the catheterization. At autopsy, histological examination demonstrated intimal fibrotic thickening of the small-sized pulmonary arteries and organizing thrombus. But there was not plexiform lesion. Heart failure was easily improved when she was first admitted. But after 3 months the cardiac catheterization revealed that her condition was already severe. Several vasodilators was not effective to such a rapidly progressive primary pulmonary hypertension.
Document 15 (Title: An autopsied case of Eisenmenger syndrome complicated by recurrent thromboembolic phenomena in postpartal period.): Dyspnea, back pain, edema, and cyanosis developed suddenly in a 23-year-old woman during the last trimester of her first pregnancy. Although she had been noticed to have the enlarged heart and exertional shortness of breath to a slight degree, she had been apparently in good condition without any significant heart murmurs. Clinically, recurrent episodes of disseminated intravascular coagulation, including pulmonary thrombosis, were thought to be superimposed to Eisenmenger syndrome associated with toxemia of pregnancy. Anticoagulant and fibrinolytic treatments were tried, but their effectiveness was limited by hemorrhagic diathesis. She died of respiratory and circulatory failure after delivery of a moribund baby. Autopsy revealed Eisenmenger complex (a defect in the membranous portion of the interventricular septum and pulmonary vascular disease) and many fresh hemmorrhages in both lungs with a lot of new and organized thrombi. Fresh thrombi were also seen in the heart, the pancreas and the kidneys. The high peripartal mortality in Eisenmenger syndrome could be attributed to pulmonary thrombosis, which may be related to DIC, as well as to peripartal changes in circulatory function.
