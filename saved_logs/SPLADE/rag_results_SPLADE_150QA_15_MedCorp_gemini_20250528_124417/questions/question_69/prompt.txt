Document 1 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Humans are the only reservoir of T. b. gambiense, which occurs in widely distributed foci in tropical rain forests of Central and West Africa. Gambiense trypanosomiasis is primarily a problem in rural populations; tourists rarely become infected. Trypanotolerant antelope species in savanna and woodland areas of Central and East Africa are the principal reservoir of T. b. rhodesiense. Cattle can also be infected with this and other trypanosome species but generally succumb to the infection. Because risk results from contact with tsetse flies that feed on wild animals, humans acquire T. b. rhodesiense infection only inciden-1397 tally, usually while visiting or working in areas where infected game and vectors are present. Roughly one or two imported cases of HAT acquired in East African parks are reported to the CDC each year.
Document 2 (Title: Onchocerciasis distribution and severity in five West African countries.): The Onchocerciasis Control Programme in West Africa recently extended its operation to Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, the western part of Mali, Senegal and Sierra Leone. To estimate the number of people infected and blinded by the disease and to determine its distribution and severity in the extension area, 215 villages were selected, using a stratified random sampling procedure, and surveyed. All the relevant entomological information available at the time was used in the sampling procedure and in the selection of 92 non-representative villages that were surveyed to confirm the findings. In addition, the populations of 608 villages were examined to map out in detail the distribution of onchocerciasis in the areas at a high risk of onchocercal blindness. The study estimated that 1,475,367 people were infected and 23,728 were blinded from onchocerciasis out of a rural population of 4,464,183. The northern and western part of the study area and the lower Niger basin presented a low or no risk of onchocercal blindness. The upper Niger basin, the south-central part of Sierra Leone, and three small foci in the Gambia, Bakoye, and lower Niger river basins were areas with a high risk of onchocercal blindness. The other parts of the study area presented a medium risk of onchocercal blindness. By detecting the communities at risk of onchocercal disease this study permits the selection of populations for disease control based on mass distribution of ivermectin, a microfilaricide.
Document 3 (Title: Heart rate): Other studies have shown that a high resting heart rate is associated with an increase in cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in the general population and in patients with chronic diseases. A faster resting heart rate is associated with shorter life expectancy and is considered a strong risk factor for heart disease and heart failure, independent of level of physical fitness. Specifically, a resting heart rate above 65 beats per minute has been shown to have a strong independent effect on premature mortality; every 10 beats per minute increase in resting heart rate has been shown to be associated with a 10–20% increase in risk of death. In one study, men with no evidence of heart disease and a resting heart rate of more than 90 beats per minute had a five times higher risk of sudden cardiac death. Similarly, another study found that men with resting heart rates of over 90 beats per minute had an almost two-fold increase in risk for cardiovascular disease mortality; in women it
Document 4 (Title: Human African Trypanosomiasis (Sleeping Sickness) -- Introduction): Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), or African sleeping sickness, is a potentially life-threatening infectious illness caused by the protozoans Trypanosoma brucei gambiense ( T brucei gambiense ) or Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense ( T brucei  rhodesiense) transmitted by the tsetse fly (see Image . Vector and Organism of Human African Trypanosomiasis). [1] This disease is endemic in sub-Saharan Africa but can be seen outside of endemic areas among travelers. These parasites produce illnesses with different clinical and epidemiological characteristics. East African HAT is caused by T brucei rhodesiense . West African HAT is caused by T brucei gambiense. Both conditions have hemolymphatic and meningoencephalitic stages. [2] HAT is considered a neglected tropical disease and is a significant public health threat in rural Africa. [3]
Document 5 (Title: Heart rate): Correlation with cardiovascular mortality risk A number of investigations indicate that faster resting heart rate has emerged as a new risk factor for mortality in homeothermic mammals, particularly cardiovascular mortality in human beings. Faster heart rate may accompany increased production of inflammation molecules and increased production of reactive oxygen species in cardiovascular system, in addition to increased mechanical stress to the heart. There is a correlation between increased resting rate and cardiovascular risk. This is not seen to be "using an allotment of heart beats" but rather an increased risk to the system from the increased rate.
Document 6 (Title: Absence of diabetes in a rural West African population with a high carbohydrate/cassava diet.): 1028 (99%) of the 1038 inhabitants of the West African village of Agbave and a random sample of 353 (12.4%) of the population of 2850 in Kati, another West African village, were screened for diabetes. Also recorded were their anthropometric data, dietary habits, possession of antibodies to malaria, and serum IgG concentrations. About 85% of the study population consumed cassava root at least once a day. The mean (SD) capillary random blood glucose concentration was 5.1 (1.1) mmol/l in men and 5.1 (0.6) in women. The mean (SD) body mass index was 20.2 (1.8) in men and 20.7 (2.3) in women. The mean blood glucose was similar whether cassava was consumed once daily, more than once daily, or less than once daily. None of the 1381 subjects examined had diabetes. This finding suggests that a high carbohydrate/cassava intake (84% of a mean daily supply of 1916 calories) combined with a low protein consumption (8% of caloric supply) does not cause diabetes. This does not support the World Health Organisation hypothesis that malnutrition-related diabetes exists, at least not in this West African rural population.
Document 7 (Title: Filovirus -- Epidemiology): The first discovery of filovirus was in 1976 and since that time has had over twenty known outbreaks, mainly located in sub-Saharan Africa in isolated rural areas and focused around Sudan, Uganda, Democratic Republic of Congo, and Gabon. To date, the largest known outbreak occurred in West Africa from 2013 to 2016. This outbreak involved multiple countries, both rural and urban areas, and had a high mortality rate with over 28000 infections and 11000 deaths. However, this number may be optimistic as the actual number is thought to be much higher due to under-reporting.  Thus far, the ebolavirus outbreaks in humans have been constrained to African countries, but this could change easily with international travel and secondary cases have been reported in Spain and the USA.
Document 8 (Title: Human African Trypanosomiasis (Sleeping Sickness) -- Epidemiology): West African HAT arises from T brucei gambiense transmission by Glossina palpalis (G palpalis), both endemic in this region. T brucei gambiense exclusively has humans as reservoirs and causes 98% of HAT. [9] G palpalis is primarily encountered in humid areas around water sources. Thus, people who live or work near watery locations are at risk of being bitten by G palpalis . [10] West African HAT is rare in short-staying tourists and visitors but is often seen in refugees and immigrants. About 80% of West African HAT cases are found in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The World Health Organization (WHO) aims to completely disrupt West African HAT transmission by 2030. [11]
Document 9 (Title: Urbanization): Food deserts in the United States are most commonly found in low-income and predominately African American neighbourhoods. One study on food deserts in Denver, Colorado found that, in addition to minorities, the affected neighbourhoods also had a high proportion of children and new births. In children, urbanization is associated with a lower risk of under-nutrition but a higher risk of being overweight. Asthma Urbanization has also been associated with an increased risk of asthma as well. Throughout the world, as communities transition from rural to more urban societies, the number of people affected by asthma increases. The odds of reduced rates of hospitalization and death from asthmas has decreased for children and young adults in urbanized municipalities in Brazil. This finding indicates that urbanization may have a negative impact on population health particularly affecting people's susceptibility to asthma.
Document 10 (Title: High density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration as a predictor of coronary heart disease in West Indian men.): The aim of the study was to determine whether the inverse association between high density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration and risk of coronary heart disease described in people of European stock was also present in other racial groups. The study was a prospective population survey. Cardiovascular risk factors were examined, including fasting serum lipid estimation (obtained at recruitment). This was a community based study within a defined survey area in Trinidad. All men aged between 35 and 69 years within the survey area were identified and followed between 1977 and 1986. Analysis was confined to those of African, Asian Indian, and mixed descent who were free of coronary heart disease at entry (n = 960, 69% of age eligible men in the survey population). 64 men developed coronary heart disease during the study period. A strong inverse curvilinear relation was found between high density lipoprotein cholesterol and coronary heart disease incidence (p less than 0.005), independent of age or other relevant characteristics including low density lipoprotein cholesterol. A low serum concentration of high density lipoprotein cholesterol is a risk factor for coronary heart disease in non-whites as well as in whites.
Document 11 (Title: Naloxone -- Indications): The rate of opioid overdose has increased significantly across the United States over the past 20 years. While many factors have contributed to this escalation, the rate of overdose appears to be highest in rural communities compared to urban areas. West Virginia has the highest per-capita overdose rate in the country, and over 50% of this state's population resides in rural areas. Opioid use disorder is associated with severely elevated morbidity and mortality rates.
Document 12 (Title: Boxed warning): , the FDA added a boxed warning to the anticoagulant warfarin due to the risk of bleeding to death. In February 2006, the FDA's Drug Safety and Risk Management Advisory Committee voted to include boxed warnings on methylphenidate formulations used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, such as Ritalin (methylphenidate), due to possible cardiovascular side-effects. A month later, the agency's Pediatric Advisory Committee effectively rejected recommending boxed warnings for both cardiovascular and psychiatric adverse effects. (Minutes and transcripts of the relevant meetings are available on the FDA website.) On November 14, 2007, the FDA added a boxed warning to the diabetes medication Avandia (rosiglitazone), citing the risk of heart failure or heart attack to patients with underlying heart disease, or are at a high heart attack risk.
Document 13 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Many rare inherited forms of CKD follow a Mendelian inheritance pattern, often as part of a systemic syndrome, with the most common in this category being autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. In addition, recent research in the genetics of predisposition to common complex diseases (Chap. 82) has revealed DNA sequence variants at a number of genetic loci that are associated with common forms of CKD. A striking example is the finding of allelic versions of the APOL1 gene, of West African population ancestry, which contributes to the several-fold higher frequency of certain common etiologies of nondiabetic CKD (e.g., focal segmental glomerulosclerosis) observed among African and Hispanic Americans. The prevalence in West African populations seems to have arisen as an evolutionary adaptation conferring protection from tropical pathogens. As in other common diseases
Document 14 (Title: Cystic fibrosis in the South West African Afrikaner. An example of population drift, possibly with heterozygote advantage.): An incidence of the genetic recessive disease cystic fibrosis (mucoviscidosis) far in excess of that reported recently from other countries, has been encountered in the South West African Afrikaner. This has probably resulted from the immigration of a segment of the South African Afrikaner population rich in the gene, into South West Africa, where, for religious reasons and reasons of geographical isolation, the gene has persisted and, perhaps, increased in frequency. Malaria, which killed many of the early settlers, might have selectively spared carriers of the gene, thus enriching its occurrence in the population. Details of patients, particularly with regard to the criteria of diagnosis, are given with the relevant population and birth figures, from which an estimate of the incidence of the disease and of its carrier rate has been made. Screening of the newborn for the condition and the compiling of a register of potential and obligatory carriers are also discussed.
Document 15 (Title: Dapagliflozin): Medical uses Dapagliflozin is used along with diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes and to reduce the risk of hospitalization for heart failure among adults with type 2 diabetes and known cardiovascular disease or other risk factors. It appears more useful than empagliflozin. In addition, dapagliflozin is indicated for the treatment of adults with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure. It is also indicated to reduce the risk of kidney function decline, kidney failure, cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure in adults with chronic kidney disease who are at risk of disease progression.
