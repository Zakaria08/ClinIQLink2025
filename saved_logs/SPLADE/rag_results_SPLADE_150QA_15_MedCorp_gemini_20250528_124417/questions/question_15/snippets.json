        "content": "The patient was a 29-year-old woman. She was well until autumn 1983, when she presented with polyarthralgia, fever above 39 degrees C, hepatosplenomegaly, swelling of lymphnode and salmon pink rash. Laboratory tests revealed marked leucocytosis with shift to the left, elevated ESR, strong positivity of CRP and abnormal liver function tests. However, anti-nuclear antibody and RA factor were negative. She was diagnosed as adult onset Still's disease (AOSD) by characteristic clinical course and laboratory data. During her disease course these abnormal findings could be well controlled neither by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, immunosuppressive agents nor corticosteroids. Two and half years after the first admission, she began to complain of dry cough, dyspnea on efforts. Auscultation revealed an increased pulmonic sound and systolic murmur of cardiac apex. Chest X-Rays showed enlarged main pulmonary arteries. The lung fields were normal. Pulmonary function tests gave no evidence of a significant obstructive or restrictive defect but showed the low DLco and hypoxemia. Ventilation-perfusion lung scanning failed to reveal pulmonary embolism. Finally, right heart catheterization confirmed the pulmonary precapillary hypertension. Her pulmonary hypertension has progressed rapidly, strongly suggesting poor prognosis. Her pulmonary hypertension associated with no apparent parenchymal involvement was thought to be caused by a pulmonary vascular change probably related to AOSD. This case is a first case of AOSD with pulmonary hypertension.",

A 39-year-old, 29-week pregnant woman was admitted to our hospital with complaints of nonproductive cough and fever on June 12. On admission, her temperature was 38.2 degrees C; pulse rate was 90/min., and blood pressure was 120/76 mmHg. Physical examination revealed moist rales at right lung basis. Chest X-ray showed small nodular infiltrates in right lower lung field. Laboratory data revealed positive CRP, accelerated ESR and increased level of alpha 2-globulin. The number of T-cells was markedly decreased (14/mm3). The PPD skin test was negative, and the sputum smears for acid-fast bacilli were negative. Suspected of bacterial or viral pneumonia, the patient was treated with antibiotics (CPM, EM and CAZ), which had no effects for her. On June 16, the Chest X-ray showed infiltrates throughout bilateral lung fields, and the patient became increasingly dyspneic. On June 18, the results of arterial blood gas, analysis under room air were: PaO2 26.7 Torr, PaCO2 29.0 Torr, pH 7.505.

COPD caused by smoking is a permanent, incurable (often terminal) reduction of pulmonary capacity characterised by shortness of breath, wheezing, persistent cough with sputum, and damage to the lungs, including emphysema and chronic bronchitis. The carcinogen acrolein and its derivatives also contribute to the chronic inflammation present in COPD. Cardiovascular disease Inhalation of tobacco smoke causes several immediate responses within the heart and blood vessels. Within one minute the heart rate begins to rise, increasing by as much as 30 percent during the first 10 minutes of smoking. Carbon monoxide in tobacco smoke exerts negative effects by reducing the blood's ability to carry oxygen.",
