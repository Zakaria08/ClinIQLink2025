The ability of serum PSA to distinguish between benign and malignant prostatic conditions is particularly poor in the intermediate range of 4.1 and 10 ng./ml. by the Hybritech assay. We used transrectal ultrasound determined prostate volumes in a well characterized population of 533 men to form a serum PSA/prostate volume ratio called prostate specific antigen density (PSAD). The prevalence of cancer in the entire population was 18.4%. Discriminant analysis according to negative or positive outcome allowed for the construction of nomograms, which resulted in a PSAD defined cancer risk ranging from 3 to 100%.

A review of the findings from the largest prospective study of patients with localized and locally advanced prostate cancer and from retrospective flow cytometric studies of specific disease stages suggests that DNA flow cytometry offers additional prognostic information for this disease. However, for the individual patient, this added information may have limited value, since approximately 15% of those with diploid disease will experience disease progression within 5 years as compared with half of those with nondiploid disease. We have found that ploidy does not predict length of survival once prostate cancer becomes disseminated, nor does it predict those who will benefit from receiving definitive radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer. On the other hand, for those who have persistent tumor, we have frequently found increased ploidy abnormalities in the tumor sampled after radiation therapy and are currently correlating this finding with clinical outcome. We have also found that DNA flow cytometry can be used to predict tumor volume. For larger, grade-matched diploid tumors, there are significant increases in the proliferation of both the tumor and the adjacent benign tissue, which we take to be evidence of \"field effects\" in this disease. An even more obvious manifestation of the same phenomenon is seen in the occurrence of aneuploidy in benign tissue near high-grade, large-volume prostate cancer.
