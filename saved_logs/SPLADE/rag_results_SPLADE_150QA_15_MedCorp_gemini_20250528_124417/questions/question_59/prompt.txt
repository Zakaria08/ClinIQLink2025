Document 2 (Title: Can short hospital admissions be avoided? A review of admissions of less than 24 hours' duration in a paediatric teaching hospital.): To review the records of children admitted to hospital for less than 24 hours to assess the appropriateness of the admission and subsequent discharge, and the suitability of these patients for admission to a short stay area rather than the hospital wards. Retrospective study consisting of a one in three sample of all children admitted to the hospital's general medical units over one year. All admissions were listed sequentially, and every third patient was included in the study. Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne; a tertiary paediatric hospital with a major primary care role. There were a total of 660 patients eligible for inclusion in the study; 220 were selected, and all records were reviewed. It was found that although 87.7% of admissions could be justified on medical grounds alone, the children quickly recovered with at least 65% being fit for discharge within 12 hours of admission. In spite of this the mean duration of admission was 17.0 hours. The majority of patients were suffering from easily diagnosed and treated disorders, with 78.9% falling into four diagnostic groups (asthma, ingestions, infections, and convulsions). Criteria for admission to a short stay observation area were satisfied in 65% of patients (at the time of the study no such area existed in the hospital). No patients were discharged inappropriately early. A significant number of children require brief hospitalisation for relatively minor illness, but unnecessary delays caused by administrative aspects of hospital admission and relatively infrequent inpatient review by medical staff often lengthen the period of admission. Significant cost savings are possible with the use of a short stay facility, and a large number of patients are suitable for this form of care.
Document 3 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): Surgery, Dr. Paul Ward, said it best: “We strive to produce graduates of our resi-dency program who are among those who change the way we think and practice.”142 Having more than 25 former residents become chairs of academic head and neck surgical programs, Dr. Ward embodied the role as a surgeon’s coach. The respon-sibilities of an effective mentor are summarized by Barondess: “Mentoring, to be effective, requires of the mentor empathy, maturity, self-confidence, resourcefulness, and willingness to commit time and energy to another. The mentor must be able to offer guidance for a new and evolving professional life, to stimulate and challenge, to encourage self-realization, to fos-ter growth, and to make more comprehensible the landscape in which the protégé stands.”143One of the major goals of mentors is to assess the aptitudes and abilities of mentees with regard to the appropriateness of their vision for their surgical career. Proper selection of the appropriate mentor can bring to
Document 4 (Title: Case Study: 33-Year-Old Female Presents with Chronic SOB and Cough (Archived) -- Case Presentation): History of Present Illness: A 33-year-old white female presents after admission to the general medical/surgical hospital ward with a chief complaint of shortness of breath on exertion. She reports that she was seen for similar symptoms previously at her primary care physician’s office six months ago. At that time, she was diagnosed with acute bronchitis and treated with bronchodilators, empiric antibiotics, and a short course oral steroid taper. This management did not improve her symptoms, and she has gradually worsened over six months. She reports a 20-pound (9 kg) intentional weight loss over the past year. She denies camping, spelunking, or hunting activities. She denies any sick contacts. A brief review of systems is negative for fever, night sweats, palpitations, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, neural sensation changes, muscular changes, and increased bruising or bleeding. She admits a cough, shortness of breath, and shortness of breath on exertion.
Document 5 (Title: Past Present and Future of Simulation in Internal Medicine -- Curriculum Development): New curricular innovations can be trialed in simulation. One large academic program successfully employed senior medical residents to facilitate simulation training for their first years. Surveyed interns rated the program highly, and senior residents thought the program was educationally valuable for the first-year residents, improved their teaching skills, and translated to improved teaching on the wards. Programs like these are effective educational models and benefit both the resident teacher and learner. This may be a good model for internal medicine residency programs with many learners but few teaching faculty. [2] [10]
Document 6 (Title: Pulse Oximetry -- Introduction): Pulse oximetry is also used in emergency departments, hospital wards, and ambulances to assess blood oxygenation in patients with respiratory difficulties or to monitor the potential respiratory depressant effects of pain medications. Since the widespread use of pulse oximetry in hospitals was instituted, the incidence of unrecognized oxygen desaturation has decreased significantly. [3]
Document 7 (Title: Obstentrics_Williams): Following uncomplicated vaginal delivery, hospitalization is seldom warranted for more than 48 hours. A woman should receive instructions concerning anticipated normal physiological puerperal changes, including lochia patterns, weight loss from diuresis, and milk let-down. She also should receive instructions concerning fever, excessive vaginal bleeding, or leg pain, swelling, or tenderness. Persistent headaches, shortness of breath, or chest pain warrant immediate concern. Hospital-stay length following labor and delivery is now regulated by federal law (Chap. 32, p. 616). Currently, the norms are hospital stays up to 48 hours following uncomplicated vaginal delivery and up to 96 hours following uncomplicated cesarean delivery (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2017; Blumenfield, 2015). Earlier hospital discharge is acceptable for appropriately selected women if they desire it .
Document 8 (Title: Neurology_Adams): The descriptions in the preceding pages apply to blunt, nonpenetrating injuries of the skull and their effects on the brain. In the past, the care of penetrating craniocerebral injuries was mainly the interest of the military surgeon, but—with the persistence of violent crime in society—such cases have also become commonplace on the emergency wards of general hospitals.
Document 9 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Assessment of Severity and Hospital Triage Severity of acute pancreatitis should be determined in the emergency ward to assist in patient triage to a regular hospital ward or step-down unit or direct admission to an intensive care unit. The Bedside Index of Severity in Acute Pancreatitis (BISAP) incorporates five clinical and laboratory parameters obtained within the first 24 h of hospitalization (Table 371-3)—BUN >25 mg/dL, impaired mental status (Glasgow coma score <15), SIRS, age >60 years, and pleural effusion on radiography—that can be useful in assessing severity. Presence of three or more of these factors was associated with substantially increased risk for in-hospital mortality among patients with acute pancreatitis. In addition, an elevated hematocrit >44% and admission BUN >22 mg/dL are also associated with more severe acute pancreatitis. Incorporating these indices with the overall patient response to initial fluid resuscitation in the emergency ward can be useful at
Document 10 (Title: Effect of daily charge feedback on inpatient charges and physician knowledge and behavior.): Concurrent charge feedback has gained widespread acceptance as a method of minimizing hospitals' losses under the Medicare prospective payment system despite the fact that its effect on patient outcomes, physician behavior, or charges has not been studied in depth. In a controlled trial on two medical wards in an academic medical center, the effect of daily charge feedback on charges was studied. Sixty-eight house staff and 16 teaching attending physicians participated during a 35-week period, taking care of 1057 eligible patients. No significant differences in charges were seen when all patients were included. Since 45% of patients had planned protocol admissions (diagnostic workups or protocol treatment) on which the house staff had little change to impact, a subgroup analysis was performed, excluding these patients. In the remaining patients, a highly significant reduction in mean total charges (17%), length of stay (18%), room charges (18%), and diagnostic testing (20%) was found. In-hospital mortality and preventable readmission within 30 days were similar on the two wards. It was concluded that charge feedback alone is effective in a teaching hospital for decreasing charges.
Document 11 (Title: Central Line–Associated Blood Stream Infections -- Epidemiology): CLABSIs lead to prolonged hospital stays and increase healthcare costs and mortality. An estimated 250,000 bloodstream infections occur annually, and most are related to the presence of intravascular devices. In the United States, the CLABSI rate in intensive care units (ICU) is estimated to be 0.8 per 1000 central line days. International Nosocomial Infection Control Consortium (INICC) surveillance data from January 2010 through December 2015 (703 intensive care units in 50 countries) reported a CLABSI rate of 4.1 per 1000 central line days. Many central lines are found outside the ICUs. In 1 study, 55% of ICU and 24% of non-ICU patients had central lines. However, as more patients are located outside the ICU, 70% of hospitalized patients with central venous catheters were outside the ICU. [6] In recent years, peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) have increased significantly, given some inherent advantages these devices offer. [7] Trained clinical staff can place PICC lines at the bedside with ultrasound guidance, allowing quick central venous access in ICUs and general medical wards. Since PICCs are inserted in a peripheral arm vein with the tip advanced into a central vein (cavoatrial junction or the right atrium) by definition, they are central venous catheters (See Image. Central Venous Catheterization Body Access). The rates of CLABSI associated with PICCs are statistically similar to the conventional central venous catheters (CVCs) in the hospital setting. [8] In a multicenter study of 27,289 patients, CLABSI outcomes were similar between the PICCs placed in the ICU and the general medical ward. However, the study was limited, with an overall low number of events. [9]
Document 12 (Title: Psychiatric hospital): Medium term Another type of psychiatric hospital is medium term, which provides care lasting several weeks. Most drugs used for psychiatric purposes take several weeks to take effect, and the main purpose of these hospitals is to monitor the patient for the first few weeks of therapy to ensure the treatment is effective. Juvenile wards Juvenile wards are sections of psychiatric hospitals or psychiatric wards set aside for children with mental illness. However, there are a number of institutions specializing only in the treatment of juveniles, particularly when dealing with drug abuse, self-harm, eating disorders, anxiety, depression or other mental illness. Long-term care facilities
Document 13 (Title: Women's and Children's Hospital): The hospital is part of the wider Women's and Children's Health Network, which includes the Child and Family Health Service, Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service, Metropolitan Youth Health, Women's Health, Yarrow Place, Torrens House and Helen Mayo House. The official Facebook Page of the Women's and Children's Hospital and Health Network is @WCHNetwork. A new hospital will be built next to the New Royal Adelaide Hospital, near the river Torrens. Emergency The Women's and Children's Hospital Paediatric Emergency Department is open 24 hours, 7 day a week and is located on the ground floor, with access from Kermode Street, Sir Edwin Smith Avenue and Brougham Place.

Document 14 (Title: Acetaminophen/Aspirin/Caffeine -- Adverse Effects -- Caffeine): A double-blinded, randomized, and placebo-controlled trial in 13 academic hospitals in 4 countries showed that caffeine did not affect general intelligence, attention, and behavior and was safe for use. [9] [10] As a treatment for acute primary headaches, patients may develop several adverse effects: Nervousness Nausea Abdominal pain/discomfort Dizziness [11] Nervousness was the most frequently reported adverse effect.
Document 15 (Title: Acute medical unit): An acute admissions unit is a short-stay department in some British, Australian and New Zealand hospitals that may be linked to the emergency department, but functions as a separate department. The AMU acts as a gateway between a patient's general practitioner, the emergency department, and the wards of the hospital. The AMU helps the emergency department produce a healthy turnaround for patients, helping with the four-hour waiting rule in the United Kingdom. An AMU is usually made up of several bays and has a small number of side-rooms and treatment rooms. They are fully equipped with emergency medical treatment facilities including defibrillators and resuscitation equipment.
