Document 1 (Title: Pelvic Exenteration -- Introduction): Pelvic exenteration was initially described in 1948 for the palliative management of recurrent cervical carcinoma. [2] [1] High surgical mortalities and poor survival outcomes in the 1940s and early 1950s limited the enthusiasm for these radical resections during the latter half of the 20th century. Medical advances involving anesthesia, transfusions, imaging, critical care, and surgical techniques have combined to allow pelvic exenteration to be performed with greater safety and improved outcomes. [3] In the 1950s and 1960s, the indications for pelvic exenteration were extended beyond palliative resections of cervical cancer and currently include curative resection of locally advanced cancers involving contiguous structures (eg, rectal, ovarian, vulvar, prostate, and pelvic sarcomas and melanomas). [4] [5] A nonmalignant indication for pelvic exenteration includes radiation necrosis. [3] [6] [7] The primary contraindication for pelvic exenteration is the inability to achieve clear surgical margins free of malignancy (R0) in a well-informed patient. Because of the postoperative morbidity that may accompany the procedure, there is generally an unspoken consensus that exenteration should be offered only with resectable disease and with curative intent. [8]
Document 2 (Title: [Pelvic exenteration in advanced and or recurrent rectal cancer].): Operative procedures of pelvic exenteration which were performed on a 54 yrs male patient with irradiated rectal cancer involving the prostatic gland, perineal skin and gluteal muscles were demonstrated by cinema. Perianal fistula formation and hard fibrotic adhesion between the distal rectum and the sacrum were also seen. As a result, combined resection of the perianal skin, gluteal muscles and distal sacral bone (fourth and fifth sacral and coccygeal vertebrae) was carried out. Fifty four total pelvic exenteration were performed at National Cancer Center Hospital from 1962 to 1985. The procedures were performed as a definitive treatment for the primary tumors in 35 cases (31 males and 4 females) which corresponds to 2.7% of operated primary rectal cancer at the same period and for the locally recurrent cancer in 19 cases (13 males and 6 females). By post operative histopathological examination 35 operations, 28 of 35 primary and 7 of 19 recurrent cases, were assessed as potentially curative. Hospital death rate was 13%; i.e. 7 cases (1 of 35 primary and 6 of 19 recurrent cases). Postoperative survival rates of the 54 patients were calculated by Kaplan-Meier's method. There were 17 survivors among 35 curatively operated patients and 5 yr survival rate was 34%. On the other hand, though 6 patients are surviving, there is no long term survivor (more than 35 months) among 21 patients who were treated by palliative resection.
Document 3 (Title: Gynecology_Novak): 2. Patients with stage IV disease with either rectovaginal or vesicovaginal fistula may be candidates for primary pelvic exenteration with pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy (225). Low rectal anastomosis, continent urinary diversion, and vaginal reconstruction are indicated and are more successful in these nonirradiated patients than in patients who received prior radiation therapy. 3. Women with central pelvic recurrence after radiation therapy are candidates for pelvic exenteration similar to that used for cervical cancer. 4. Surgical staging with resection of enlarged lymph nodes followed by radiation therapy may improve the control of pelvic disease.
Document 4 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): therapy, either preor postoperatively, further reduces the likelihood of pelvic recurrences but does not appear to prolong survival. Combining radiation therapy with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-based chemotherapy, preferably prior to surgical resection, lowers local recurrence rates and improves overall survival. Preoperative radiotherapy is indicated for patients with large, potentially unresectable rectal cancers; such lesions may shrink enough to permit subsequent surgical removal. Radiation therapy is not effective as the primary treatment of colon cancer.
Document 5 (Title: Radiation therapy): Intestinal discomfort The lower bowel may be treated directly with radiation (treatment of rectal or anal cancer) or be exposed by radiation therapy to other pelvic structures (prostate, bladder, female genital tract). Typical symptoms are soreness, diarrhoea, and nausea. Nutritional interventions may be able to help with diarrhoea associated with radiotherapy. Studies in people having pelvic radiotherapy as part of anticancer treatment for a primary pelvic cancer found that changes in dietary fat, fibre and lactose during radiotherapy reduced diarrhoea at the end of treatment. Swelling
Document 6 (Title: Cervical Cancer -- Surgical Oncology -- Pelvic exenteration): Pelvic exenteration is the most radical surgical procedure for cervical cancer. Indications are confined to patients with central pelvic recurrence after radiotherapy or patients with stage IVA disease who cannot receive radiotherapy. Classically, a total pelvic exenteration includes the removal of the uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries, vagina, bladder, urethra, and rectum. Reconstruction consists of an ileal conduit, or continent diversion, for the urinary system and an end colostomy for the GI system. Continent diversions include the Indiana and Miami pouch techniques. [36] [37]
Document 7 (Title: Pelvic exenteration): Recovery Pelvic exenteration leaves a person with a permanent colostomy and urinary diversion. A 2015 article reports that pelvic exenteration can provide long-term survival for patients with locally advanced primary rectal carcinoma. The 5-year survival rate of patients undergoing pelvic exenteration following complete resection of disease was 59.3%. Factors shown to influence the survival rate following a pelvic exenteration procedure include age, the presence of metastatic disease, lymph node status, circumferential resection margin, local recurrence of disease, and the need for neoadjuvant therapy. History The procedure was first described by Alexander Brunschwig in 1948. References Surgical oncology Female genital procedures
Document 8 (Title: Colorectal cancer): Radiation therapy While a combination of radiation and chemotherapy may be useful for rectal cancer, for some people requiring treatment, chemoradiotherapy can increase acute treatment-related toxicity, and has not been shown to improve survival rates compared to radiotherapy alone, although it is associated with less local recurrence. The use of radiotherapy in colon cancer is not routine due to the sensitivity of the bowels to radiation. As with chemotherapy, radiotherapy can be used as a neoadjuvant for clinical stages T3 and T4 for rectal cancer. This results in downsizing or downstaging of the tumour, preparing it for surgical resection, and also decreases local recurrence rates. For locally advanced rectal cancer, neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy has become the standard treatment. Additionally, when surgery is not possible radiation therapy has been suggested to be an effective treatment against CRC pulmonary metastases, which are developed by 10-15% of people with CRC.
Document 9 (Title: [Posterior pelvic exenteration in the treatment of extraperitoneal rectal cancer in females].): Postoperative recurrence is common in the, posterior vaginal wall and intrapelvic genital organs after conventional Mile's operation for extraperitoneal rectal cancer in female patients. We have performed posterior pelvic exenteration (PPE) since 1954 in an attempt to reduce such recurrences. The results of 208 patients treated by PPE were compared with those of 77 patients treated by conventional Mile's operation during 1954-1986. The 5-year survival rate of PPE was 53.15 +/- 1.87% and that of Mile's operation was 51.84 +/- 1.68%; the increase was not significant as more cases of poorer prognosis were selected for PPE. However, the local recurrence rate was lower after PPE than after conventional Mile's operation (4.33%:20.78%), (P less than 0.01). We believe that PPE is indicated in anterior rectal lesions of Dukes A, B or C stage, ulcerative or infiltrative type, or when the recto-uterine pouch is involved. PPE will not increase the operative risk if close attention is paid to hemostasis, facilitated by clamping cutting and suture ligating the lateral vaginal wall in segments.
Document 10 (Title: Unresectable and locally recurrent rectal cancer treated with radiotherapy or bilateral internal iliac artery infusion of 5-fluorouracil.): Seventy-nine patients with histopathologically verified unresectable or locally recurrent rectal cancer were nonrandomly allocated to radiotherapy or regional intra-arterial infusion of 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU). Fifteen patients with unresectable and 32 with locally recurrent rectal cancer were subjected to radiotherapy. The absorbed dose was 30 Gy in patients with an unresectable tumor and 45 Gy in patients with locally recurrent rectal cancer. Six patients with unresectable and 26 with locally recurrent rectal cancer received bilateral internal iliac artery infusion of 5-FU in a median dose of 7.5 g. There was no difference in survival between the two methods of treatment. Resection of an initially unresectable tumor could be performed in 5 of 21 patients (4 after radiotherapy and 1 after chemotherapy). All except eight patients had pelvic or perineal pain before treatment. Forty of 43 (93%) patients reported pain relief after radiotherapy and 21 of 28 (75%) after infusion therapy. Ten nonresponders were subjected to alternative treatment (three to intra-arterial infusion and seven to radiotherapy). Five of these ten patients reported complete pain relief and five partial pain relief. After radiotherapy, no significant side effects or complications were observed. The infusion chemotherapy was the cause of death in one patient. In summary, similar palliation was achieved with bilateral iliac artery 5-FU-infusion and radiotherapy. Owing to the complications registered with infusion therapy, radiotherapy must be considered the treatment of choice for these patients. Patients who do not respond to radiotherapy or suffer recurrence of pelvic and perineal pain may receive further palliation from intra-arterial infusion.
Document 11 (Title: Particle therapy): Carbon ion radiotherapy Carbon ion therapy (CIRT) uses particles more massive than protons or neutrons. Carbon ion radiotherapy has increasingly garnered scientific attention as technological delivery options have improved and clinical studies have demonstrated its treatment advantages for many cancers such as prostate, head and neck, lung, and liver cancers, bone and soft tissue sarcomas, locally recurrent rectal cancer, and pancreatic cancer, including locally advanced disease. It also has clear advantages to treat otherwise intractable hypoxic and radio-resistant cancers while opening the door for substantially hypo-fractionated treatment of normal and radio-sensitive disease.
Document 12 (Title: Gynecology_Novak): Radiation Retreatment Retreatment of recurrent pelvic disease by means of radiotherapy with curative intent is confined to patients who had suboptimal or incomplete primary therapy. This may allow the radiotherapist to deliver curative doses of radiation to the tumor. The proximity of the bladder and rectum to the cancer and the relative sensitivity of these organs to radiation injury are the major deterrents to retreatment with radiation. The insertion of multiple interstitial radiation sources into locally recurrent cancer through a perineal template may help overcome these dosimetric considerations (173,183). The fistula rates are high, and those consequences must be considered before interstitial therapy is initiated. For patients considered curable with interstitial implant therapy, pelvic exenteration is a better treatment choice. Palliative radiotherapy can be given to patients with localized metastatic lesions that are deemed incurable. Painful bony metastases, central nervous
Document 13 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): who have undergone cura-tive intent surgery for colorectal carcinoma will eventually develop recurrent disease. Most recurrences occur within the first 2 years after the initial diagnosis, but preoperative chemo-radiation therapy may delay recurrence. While most of these patients will present with distant metastases, a small propor-tion will have isolated local recurrence and may be considered for salvage surgery. Recurrence after colon cancer resection usually occurs at the local site within the abdomen or in the liver or lungs. Resection of other involved organs may be nec-essary. Recurrence of rectal cancer can be considerably more difficult to manage because of the proximity of other pelvic structures. If the patient has not received chemotherapy and radiation, then adjuvant therapy should be administered prior to salvage surgery. Radical resection may require extensive resection of pelvic organs (pelvic exenteration with or without sacrectomy). Ideally, the aim of a salvage
Document 14 (Title: [Extended surgery for advanced colo-rectal carcinoma (stage IV and V)].): Two hundred fifty-five patients with colo-rectal carcinoma underwent operations in our department between January 1980 and December 1988. The five-year survival rate of stage IV patients (30 cases) was 58%, and the three-year survival rate of stage V patients (44 cases) was 8%. The study for the expression of blood group-related cancer-associated antigens (Lea, CA19-9, etc.) in colo-rectal cancers using immunohistological method and a series of mouse monoclonal antibodies revealed that the stromal staining pattern of CA19-9 means high malignancy with poor prognosis. Nineteen patients with locally invading rectal cancer were submitted to total pelvic exenteration with urinary diversion. The operative mortality rate was 5.3%. A determinate 5-year survival rate of 4.5 was achieved. Fourteen patients with local recurrent lesions of rectal cancer following abdominoperineal resection were submitted to pelvic exenteration combined with sacral resection. Two patients are alive disease free for longer than four years at this writing. This operation assures a better quality of life, lessening of symptoms, disease control and, in selected patients, a cure.
Document 15 (Title: Radiation Proctitis -- Treatment / Management -- Primary Prevention): While adherence to established dose constraints is essential, how radiotherapy is delivered can also influence the risk of late rectal toxicity. When comparing 3D conformal treatment to IMRT when treating the pelvis, the incidence of late rectal toxicity appears to be lower with IMRT in the treatment of genitourinary and gynecologic malignancies. Late rectal toxicity in patients treated with 3D radiation for prostate cancer was 13% versus 5% in those treated with IMRT. [17] Postoperative endometrial and cervical cancer patients treated with IMRT also demonstrate lower rates of late gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity compared to 3D conformal (42% vs 21%). [18] [19] Despite the claims that proton therapy will lead to even lower rates of toxicity, the data suggest that proton therapy, at best, has no effect and, at worst, may have higher rates of GI toxicity compared to IMRT for patients with prostate cancer.
