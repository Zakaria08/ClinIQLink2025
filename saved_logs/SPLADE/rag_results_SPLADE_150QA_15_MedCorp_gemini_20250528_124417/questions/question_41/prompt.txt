Document 1 (Title: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis): Signs and symptoms In many people, symptoms are present for a considerable time before diagnosis. The most common clinical features of IPF include the following: Age over 50 years Dry, non-productive cough on exertion Progressive exertional dyspnea (shortness of breath with exercise) Dry, inspiratory bibasilar "velcro-like" crackles on auscultation (a crackling sound in the lungs during inhalation similar to Velcro being torn apart slowly, heard with a stethoscope). Clubbing of the digits, a disfigurement of the finger tips or toes (see image) Abnormal pulmonary function test results, with evidence of restriction and impaired gas exchange. Some of these features are due to chronic hypoxemia (oxygen deficiency in the blood), are not specific for IPF, and can occur in other pulmonary disorders. IPF should be considered in all patients with unexplained chronic exertional dyspnea who present with cough, inspiratory bibasilar crackles, or finger clubbing.
Document 2 (Title: Case Study: 33-Year-Old Female Presents with Chronic SOB and Cough (Archived) -- Case Presentation): History of Present Illness: A 33-year-old white female presents after admission to the general medical/surgical hospital ward with a chief complaint of shortness of breath on exertion. She reports that she was seen for similar symptoms previously at her primary care physician’s office six months ago. At that time, she was diagnosed with acute bronchitis and treated with bronchodilators, empiric antibiotics, and a short course oral steroid taper. This management did not improve her symptoms, and she has gradually worsened over six months. She reports a 20-pound (9 kg) intentional weight loss over the past year. She denies camping, spelunking, or hunting activities. She denies any sick contacts. A brief review of systems is negative for fever, night sweats, palpitations, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, neural sensation changes, muscular changes, and increased bruising or bleeding. She admits a cough, shortness of breath, and shortness of breath on exertion.

Ultrasound reveals a deep vein thrombosis in the left lower extremity; chest computed tomography scan confirms the presence of pulmonary emboli. Laboratory blood tests indicate elevated d-dimer levels. What therapy is indicated acutely? What are the long-term therapy options? How long should she be treated? Should this indi-vidual use oral contraceptives? A 25-year-old woman presents to the emergency depart-ment complaining of acute onset of shortness of breath and pleuritic pain. She had been in her usual state of health until 2 days prior when she noted that her left leg was swollen and red. Her only medication was oral contraceptives. Family history was significant for a history of “blood clots” in mul-tiple members of the maternal side of her family. Physical examination demonstrates an anxious woman with stable vital signs. The left
Document 4 (Title: [A case of elderly (83-year-old) woman with possible left atrial myxoma].): A 78-year-old woman with exertional dyspnea (Hugh-Jones Grade III) and dry cough was admitted to our hospital in April, 1983. She had marked cardiac cachexia and a loss of body weight due to long term heart failure. On physical examination a systolic ejection murmur and a diastolic rumbling murmur were heard without the opening snap sound. Chest radiography revealed pleural effusion and cardiomegaly. M-mode and two dimensional echocardiography demonstrated abnormal echoes in the left atrium, the density being 22.7 Hounsfield Unit. Radionuclide angiography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provided similar findings. No other mass lesion existed in the other chambers. Based on these findings, the mass was diagnosed as a left atrial myxoma. She has been well except for periodic congestive heart failure, for about five years since her discharge. The course of her ailment is interesting because her treatment is mainly symptomatic.
Document 5 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): Joshua M. Galanter, MD, & Homer A. Boushey, MD and respirations are 32/min. Her mother states that she has used her albuterol inhaler several times a day for the past 3 days and twice during the previous night. She took an additional two puffs on her way to the emergency department, but her mother states that “the inhaler didn’t seem to be helping so I told her not to take any more.” What emergency measures are indicated? How should her long-term management be altered? A 14-year-old girl with a history of asthma requiring daily inhaled corticosteroid therapy and allergies to house dust mites, cats, grasses, and ragweed presents to the emergency department in mid-September, reporting a recent “cold” com-plicated by worsening shortness of breath and audible inspi-ratory and expiratory wheezing. She appears frightened and refuses to lie down but is not cyanotic. Her pulse is 120 bpm,
Document 6 (Title: Malnutrition in a compulsive runner: a case conference.): A 28-yr-old, female marathon and "fitness" runner presented with leg swelling, fatigue, and loss of endurance. She was running an hour or more daily in addition to regular biking and swimming. She was an instructor in a fitness center. For 2 months prior to her leg swelling, she had increased fatigue and decreased exercise tolerance. She had been seen previously for a slow healing hamstring strain. She had not had a menstrual period for over 2 yr and had refused evaluation. She admitted to very low dietary intake, which she had always denied. She was worried about her body fat. She denied recent blood loss, diuretic or cathartic use, and induced vomiting. She appeared malnourished, pale, and older than her stated age. Her weight was 41.4 kg. Her blood pressure was 90/60, and her pulse was 100 per minute. She had pitting edema of the lower extremities to the knees. The diagnosis of anorexia nervosa was made and will be discussed.
Document 7 (Title: Case Study: 33-Year-Old Female Presents with Chronic SOB and Cough (Archived) -- Case Presentation): Social History: Her tobacco use is 33 pack-years; however, she quit smoking shortly prior to the onset of symptoms, six months ago. She denies alcohol and illicit drug use. She is in a married, monogamous relationship and has three children aged 15 months to 5 years. She is employed in a cookie bakery. She has two pet doves. She traveled to Mexico for a one-week vacation one year ago. Allergies: No known medicine, food, or environmental allergies. Past Medical History: Hypertension Past Surgical History: Cholecystectomy Medications: Lisinopril 10 mg by mouth every day
Document 8 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): Her social history is significant for alcohol use (three to four glasses of wine/night). Her vital signs include the following: temperature 99.8°F, blood pressure 132/64 mm Hg, pulse 78 bpm, and respiratory rate 15/min. On physical examination, she had left upper abdominal tenderness with evidence of hepatomegaly and mild scleral icterus. Laboratory data revealed the following: alanine aminotransferase, 527 IU/L (normal 10–35 IU/L); aspartate aminotransferase, 425 IU/L (normal < 35 IU/L); and bilirubin, 2.9 mg/dL (normal 0.1–0.3 mg/dL). What medications do OTC cold and flu preparations typically contain? Which of the OTC medications might have contrib-uted to the patient’s current symptoms? KH, a 55-year-old woman, presents to the emergency department with nausea, vomiting, and complaints of new-onset flu symptoms over the past several days. Her past medical history is significant for allergic rhinitis and chronic lower back pain secondary to a work-related fall 2 years ago. Her
Document 9 (Title: Case Study: 33-Year-Old Female Presents with Chronic SOB and Cough (Archived) -- Case Presentation -- Physical Exam:): Vitals: Temperature, 97.8 F; heart rate 88; respiratory rate, 22; blood pressure 130/86; body mass index, 28 General: She is well appearing but anxious, a pleasant female lying on a hospital stretcher. She is conversing freely, with respiratory distress causing her to stop mid-sentence. Respiratory: She has diffuse rales and mild wheezing; tachypneic. Cardiovascular: She has a regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Gastrointestinal: Bowel sounds X4. No bruits or pulsatile mass.
Document 10 (Title: [A case of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia with hyperinfection of Strongyloides stercoralis complicated with smoldering adult T-cell leukemia].): A 43-year-old woman visited a clinic for an attack of bronchial asthma which she had been suffering since her childhood. She was treated with prednisolone which was used for the first time. Two weeks later, she had a fever and her chest X-ray showed diffuse reticulonodular shadows on both middle to lower lung fields. In spite of the use of antibacterial drugs, her symptoms such as cough, dyspnea, malaise and fever increased. It was revealed that she had Stronglyoides sterocoralis in the stool. She was referred to our department for treatment and further examination. Transbronchial lung biopsy (TBLB) was performed, and cyst of Pneumocystis carinii were histologically detected in the lung specimen. Anti-human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) antibody in the serum was 1:4,096 less than. Typical adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) cells were also observed in the peripheral blood smear at the rate of 10-15% of leukocytes. The parasite was observed in the sputum too. We diagnosed her as having Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia with hyperinfection of Strongyloides stercoralis complicated with smoldering ATL, and the pneumonia might have been induced by steroid therapy (total doses of 500 mg, for 25 days). After sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (ST compound) was used for the Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, her symptoms markedly subsided, and the chest X-ray findings turned to normal by 45 days after the treatment. Thiabendazole was initially administered for the Strongyloidiasis and the parasite temporarily disappeared from both sputum and stool. Then pyrvinium pamoate and mebendazole were used, but the parasite could not be completely eradicated in the stool. We did not treat the smoldering ATL because there were no symptoms. We have been looking after her as an outpatient now, and she has neither symptoms nor signs.
Document 11 (Title: Peripartum cardiomyopathy): Signs and symptoms Symptoms usually include one or more of the following: orthopnea (difficulty breathing while lying flat), dyspnea (shortness of breath) on exertion, pitting edema (swelling), cough, frequent night-time urination, excessive weight gain during the last month of pregnancy (1-2+ kg/week; two to four or more pounds per week), palpitations (sensation of racing heart-rate, skipping beats, long pauses between beats, or fluttering), and chest pain. The shortness of breath is often described by PPCM patients as the inability to take a deep or full breath or to get enough air into the lungs. Also, patients often describe the need to prop themselves up overnight by using two or more pillows in order to breathe better. These symptoms, swelling, and/or cough may be indications of pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs) resulting from acute heart failure and PPCM.
Document 12 (Title: Acute bronchitis): A variety of tests may be performed in people presenting with cough and shortness of breath: A chest X-ray is useful to exclude pneumonia which is more common in those with a fever, fast heart rate, fast respiratory rate, or who are old. A sputum sample showing neutrophil granulocytes (inflammatory white blood cells) and culture showing that has pathogenic microorganisms such as Streptococcus species. A blood test would indicate inflammation (as indicated by a raised white blood cell count and elevated C-reactive protein). Decreased breath sounds, crackles, wheezing, and rhonchi that clears with coughs may be heard in the chest. Dullness to percussion and pleural rub suggest disease extension beyond the bronchi such as seen with pneumonia. Paroxysms of cough followed by inspiratory whoop and vomiting suggests pertussis.
Document 13 (Title: Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-induced cough.): A 65-year-old woman started taking enalapril 2.5 mg daily for hypertension. Twelve days later she complained of a persistent, dry cough. Due to the coughing and a preexisting cystocele, she developed stress incontinence and a marked decline in her functional status. The coughing and incontinence resolved with the discontinuation of enalapril. During a subsequent hospitalization the patient received captopril 6.25 mg twice daily for congestive heart failure. Within 24 hours the dry cough recurred. It resolved with the discontinuation of the drug. Cough is a symptom that is generally not recognized as a drug side effect. However, increasing numbers of case reports document angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-induced cough. Although the actual frequency and mechanism are currently unknown, the dry cough typically begins early in the course of therapy. It may be specific to this pharmacologic class rather than to one individual agent. Age and sex may be contributing factors. While cough has been considered a minor side effect, unnecessary hospitalizations and inappropriate treatments may easily result. Even minor adverse reactions may have an impact on a patient's quality of life.
Document 14 (Title: [Recovery of Chlamydia pneumoniae and Chlamydia trachomatis in a patient with recurrent tonsillitis, bronchitis and otitis media with effusion].): We report a case of recurrent tonsillitis and otitis media with effusion (OME) from which Chlamydia trachomatis was isolated. Chlamydia pneumoniae, a newly recognized species of Chlamydia, was also recovered from the tonsillar and bronchial swabs. A 8-year-old girl was seen on February 23, 1988, because of a running nose, a productive cough and bilateral hearing difficulty. She had a history of recurrent tonsillitis. The diagnosis was acute sinusitis with tubal obstruction, then cefixime was prescribed. Her symptoms were once resolved, for the time being but she came back to the hospital a week later with a bilateral ear-ache. The tympanic membranes were injected and characteristically retracted. Her left ear showed type B tympanogram (effusion). Tympanocentesis was performed to remove middle-ear effusion, from which C. trachomatis but no ordinary bacterium was isolated. Therefore rokitamycin 300 mg/day was administered for a week. Her condition improved, however, a rhinorrhea, a plugged ear sensation and a hacking cough returned in a month. She was admitted to the hospital on May 10, for tympanostomy and grommet insertion, but from the day before admission, she had a sore throat with fever (39.2 degrees C). The surgery was withheld until May 26. When adenotonsillectomy and grommets insertion were undertaken, C. trachomatis had disappeared from the middle-ear effusion, but C. pneumoniae was recovered from both tonsillar and bronchial swabs. Readministration of rokitamycin was performed and to date (June, 1990) she remains well.
Document 15 (Title: Biochemistry_Lippinco): Case 2: Skin Rash Patient Presentation: KL is a 34-year-old woman who presents with a red, nonitchy rash on her left thigh and flu-like symptoms. Focused History: KL reports that the rash first appeared a little over 2 weeks ago. It started out small but has gotten larger. She also thinks she is getting the flu because her muscles and joints ache (myalgia and arthralgia, respectively), and she has had a headache for the last few days. Upon questioning, KL reports that she and her husband took a camping trip through New England last month. Pertinent Findings: The physical examination is remarkable for the presence of a red, circular, flat lesion ~11 cm in size that resembles a bullseye (erythema migrans) (see image at right). KL also has a low-grade fever. Diagnosis: KL has Lyme disease caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, which is transmitted by the bite of a tick in the genus Ixodes. Infected ticks are endemic in the Northeast region of the United States.

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
Question: A 43-year-old woman presents to the emergency department complaining of palpitations, dry cough, and shortness of breath for 1 week. She immigrated to the United States from Korea at the age of 20. She says that her heart is racing and she has never felt these symptoms before. Her cough is dry and is associated with shortness of breath that occurs with minimal exertion. Her past medical history is otherwise unremarkable. She has no allergies and is not currently taking any medications. She is a nonsmoker and an occasional drinker. She denies illicit drug use. Her blood pressure is 100/65 mm Hg, pulse is 76/min, respiratory rate is 23/min, and temperature is 36.8°C (98.2°F). Her physical examination is significant for bibasilar lung crackles and a non-radiating, low-pitched, mid-diastolic rumbling murmur best heard at the apical region. In addition, she has jugular vein distention and bilateral pitting edema in her lower extremities. Which of the following best describes the infectious agent that led to this patient’s condition?
Options:
A. A bacterium that induces partial lysis of red cells with hydrogen peroxide
B. A bacterium that induces complete lysis of the red cells of a blood agar plate with an oxygen-sensitive cytotoxin
