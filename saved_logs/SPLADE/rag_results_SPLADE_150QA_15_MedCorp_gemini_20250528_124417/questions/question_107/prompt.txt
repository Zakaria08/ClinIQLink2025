Document 1 (Title: Dopamine beta-hydroxylase): Assays for DBH activity in human serum and Cerebrospinal fluid DBH activity in human serum could be estimated by a spectrophotometric method or with the aid of Ultra high performance liquid chromatography with Photo Diode Array detector (UHPLC-PDA). A sensitive assay for the detection of DBH activity in cerebrospinal fluid using High-performance liquid chromatography with Electrochemical detector(HPLC-ECD) was also described earlier. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) at DBH loci Genetic variants such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms(SNPs) at DBH loci were found to be associated with DBH activity and are well known expression quantitative trait loci. Allele variants at two regulatory SNPs namely rs1611115 and rs1989787 were shown to affect transcription of this gene. Mutations identified in Dopamine beta hydroxylase deficiency and non-synonymous SNPs such as rs6271 in this gene were found to cause defective secretion of the protein from the endoplasmic reticulum.
Document 2 (Title: The identification of related substances in triamcinolone acetonide by means of high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detector and mass spectrometry.): A study of an HPLC method for the analysis of related substances in triamcinolone acetonide is described. Several systems of solvents and samples of different lots and preparative origins were examined and a rapid-scanning diode array UV detector (DAD) was particularly useful. With the proposed technique it was possible to identify 9 alpha-bromo desonide as a principal impurity, which was present in all examined samples of triamcinolone acetonide. This identification was rendered possible by the investigation of the second derivative of the UV spectra and by means of study of the mass spectrum. Furthermore, it was possible, primarily on the basis of the spectrophotometric data, to formulate reliable hypotheses on the possible identification of 9 beta, 11 beta-epoxide of the desonide which was present at very low levels and to exclude the presence of 11-deoxy-9(11)-unsaturated desonide. The presence of the above-mentioned related substances was explained considering the scheme of synthesis described in the literature. The spectrophotometric characteristics of the studied compounds and the limits of applicability of the present procedure are discussed.
Document 3 (Title: Chromatography -- Introduction -- High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC)): This is a highly sensitive and efficient technique among different chromatography techniques, also known as high-pressure liquid chromatography. [1] Here, the solvent mixture can pass through columns containing stationary phases under high atmospheric pressure of 10 Pa to 400 Pa. This high pressure creates a high flow rate in a sample of 0.1 cm/sec to 5 cm/sec, allowing separation in a few minutes. High pressure ensures high resolution and better separation of closely related compounds; it also enables using MS as detectors, which require high flow rates. [4] The eluents are detected using UV absorption and fluorescence. The basic instrumentation setup is given in image 3.
Document 4 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): is a common comorbid condition. On the other hand, if the continu-ous monitoring capacity afforded by these monitors can provide usable trend data, that may still provide clinical utility despite less accuracy at low hemoglobin levels. To date, there have been relatively few studies validating the trending capacity of noninvasive Hgb monitoring compared to serial blood draws, with limited agreement due to differences in analysis and study design.65 Further studies are required to evaluate the clinical utility of this potentially useful technology.CapnometryCapnometry is the measurement of carbon dioxide in the airway throughout the respiratory cycle. Capnometry is most commonly measured by infrared light absorption. CO2 absorbs infrared light at a peak wavelength of approximately 4.27 µm. Capnom-etry works by passing infrared light through a sample chamber to a detector on the opposite side. More infrared light passing through the sample chamber (i.e., less CO2) causes a larger
Document 5 (Title: Chromatography -- Testing Procedures): 5 . Detection and interpretation: In column chromatography, as the solute migrates through the entire system and emerges from the column, the detectors continuously monitor the emerging mobile phase called the eluate and transmit signals in the form of voltage recorded on the chromatograph. Some of the detectors used in chromatography are mass spectrometry, refractive index, electrochemical, ultraviolet, flame ionization, electron capture, and fluorescence detectors. [25] Among these, ultraviolet detectors are the most commonly used in clinical laboratories.
Document 6 (Title: Beta2 Receptor Agonists and Antagonists -- Monitoring): The plasma concentration of B2 agonists correlates with the severity of the toxicity. Direct monitoring of B2 agonists is not a regular procedure in clinical practice, as their efficacy and toxicity can be measured clinically or by using indirect tests. Nevertheless, there are some recognized tests for measuring drug concentration in the bloodstream, such as gas chromatography or liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry, high-performance liquid chromatography, fluorimetric detectors, and electrochemical detectors. Monitoring techniques are primarily used before athletic competitions to check for their use as anabolic agents. [5] Clinically, serum potassium and blood glucose require regular monitoring to manage any adverse effects early. The recurrence of asthma attacks is not an indicator of the efficacy of B2 agonists, as the main drug responsible for long-term effects is steroids.
Document 7 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): µm. Capnom-etry works by passing infrared light through a sample chamber to a detector on the opposite side. More infrared light passing through the sample chamber (i.e., less CO2) causes a larger sig-nal in the detector relative to the infrared light passing through a reference cell. Capnometric determination of the partial pressure of CO2 in end-tidal exhaled gas (Petco2) is used as a surrogate for the partial pressure of CO2 in arterial blood (Paco2) during mechanical ventilation. In healthy subjects, Petco2 is about 1 to 5 mmHg less than Paco2.66 Thus, Petco2 can be used to estimate Paco2 without the need for blood gas determination. However, changes in Petco2 may not correlate with changes in Paco2 dur-ing a number of pathologic conditions.Capnography allows the confirmation of endotracheal intubation and continuous assessment of ventilation, integrity of the airway, operation of the ventilator, and cardiopulmonary function. Capnometers are configured with either an inline
Document 8 (Title: Histology_Ross): The method is useful in detecting nucleic acids, specifically the purine and pyrimidine bases of the nucleotides. It is also useful for detecting proteins that contain certain amino acids. Using specific illuminating wavelengths, UV spectrophotometric measurements are commonly made through the UV microscope to determine quantitatively the amount of DNA and RNA in individual cells. As described in the Folder 1.2 on page 7, Feulgen microspectrophoto metry is used clinically to evaluate the degree of ploidy (multiples of normal DNA quantity) in sections of tumors. The polarizing microscope uses the fact that highly ordered molecules or arrays of molecules can rotate the angle of the plane of polarized light. The polarizing microscope is a simple modification of the light microscope in which a polarizing filter (the polarizer) is located between the light source and the specimen, and a second polarizer (the analyzer) is located between the objective lens and the viewer.
Document 9 (Title: Determination of nalbuphine using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to photodiode-array detection and gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry.): A procedure involving capillary column gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry and a method involving liquid chromatography coupled to a diode-array detector have been developed for the analysis of nalbuphine. The extraction step is the same for both techniques and involves extraction under alkaline conditions in chloroform-2-propanol-n-heptane (50:17:33, v/v/v) with levallorphan as the internal standard. After purification by acidic extraction and back alkaline extraction, drugs are derivatized with N,O-bis-(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide with 1% trimethylchlorosilane for gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and directly injected for high-performance liquid chromatography-diode-array detection. The limits of detection are 2.0 and 25.0 ng/mg, respectively.
Document 10 (Title: [Determination of acetylsalicylic and salicylic acid in tablets using high-performance liquid chromatography and a diode array detector].): A fast and sensitive method of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) for determination of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and products of salicylic acid (SA) hydrolysis in tablets has been elaborated. Extraction was done with the mixture of methanol: formic acid (98:2 v/v) and separation of the components was achieved by using the colon of Ultropac Lichrosorb RP-18, 10 um, 4 cm x 250 mm and diode array detector. The mobile phase of methanol:water: :mol/1 H3PO4 (60:35:5) v/v, pP = 2.6 and safe flow of 1 ml/min were used. Follow up of chromatographic separation of ASA, SA and internal standard beta-naphtole (ITS) was performed at the wave length of 290 microns. The threshold of ASA was 0.5 mg/ml and of SA 0.0025 mg/ml.
Document 11 (Title: CT Instrumentation and Physics -- Definition/Introduction -- Data Acquisition & Image Reconstruction): Modern CT scanners primarily employ solid-state crystal detectors. At the same time, older models may utilize xenon gas detectors, which are becoming less prevalent due to limitations in multidetector row CT (MDCT) systems. Third-generation CT scanners feature a detector array and an x-ray tube that generates a fan-shaped beam, eliminating the need for beam and detector translation. [8] This design reduces scan times and motion artifacts, improving image quality, although it may lead to ring artifacts. [2] [8] Fourth-generation scanners have a fixed detector array within the gantry while the tube rotates. Despite having more detectors, this design poses challenges related to motion artifacts. To address this issue, over-scans are utilized, but they elevate patient radiation exposure. [9] Another CT design, electron beam imaging (EBCT), employs a fixed electron gun and anode target. While it offers high speed, its clinical utility is limited due to spatial resolution concerns, cost factors, and difficulty obtaining insurance reimbursement. [10] The emergence of newer multidetector-row technology has reduced the relevance of EBCT.
Document 12 (Title: Simultaneous analysis of flunixin, naproxen, ethacrynic acid, indomethacin, phenylbutazone, mefenamic acid and thiosalicylic acid in plasma and urine by high-performance liquid chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.): Simple and reproducible high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) and gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric (GC-MS) methods have been developed for the simultaneous analysis of several acidic drugs in horse plasma and urine. Although the capillary GC-MS column provided better separation of the drugs than the reversed-phase C8 (3 microns, 75 mm) HPLC column, the total analysis time with HPLC was shorter than the total analysis time with GC-MS. The HPLC system equipped with a diode-array detector provided simultaneous screening (limit of detection 100-500 ng/ml) and confirmation (limit 1.0 micrograms/ml) of the drugs. The HPLC system equipped with fixed-wavelength ultraviolet and fluorescence detectors provided a relatively sensitive screening [limit of detection 50-150 ng/ml for ultraviolet and 10 ng/ml for fluorescence (naproxen only) detectors] of the drugs. However, the positive samples had to be confirmed by using either the diode-array detector or the GC-MS system. The GC-MS system provided simultaneous screening and confirmation of the drugs at very low concentrations (20-50 ng/ml).
Document 13 (Title: Monitoring of haemoglobin-methyl isocyanate adduct by high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detector.): Carbamylation of haemoglobin by methyl isocyanate (MIC) was detected by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a photodiode array detector following cyclisation of the N-terminal valine into methyl isopropyl hydantoin (MIH). MIH was also synthesised by reaction of MIC with valine, the chromatographic conditions standardised and the spectrum derived by a photodiode array detector recorded for confirmation of the identity of MIH. This HPLC method is specific, sensitive and suitable for the detection of exposure of blood samples to methyl isocyanate.
Document 14 (Title: Gas chromatography ion detector): Types of Ion Detectors Flame ionization detector (FID) -- uses a flame to produce ions Electron capture detector (ECD) -- uses beta radiation Photo-ionization detector (PID) -- uses UV light to produce ions Helium ionization detector (HID) -- uses a radioactive source to produce helium ions, which in turn ionize the components Discharge ionization detector (DID) -- uses an electric spark source to produce helium ions, which in turn ionize the components Pulsed discharge ionization detector (PDD) -- similar to a Discharge ionization detector (DID), but uses a different sort of spark References See also Gas Chromatograph Chromatography detector Gas chromatography
Document 15 (Title: CT Instrumentation and Physics -- Definition/Introduction -- Data Acquisition & Image Reconstruction): CT utilizes detectors, which can be single elements or part of a larger detector array, and includes reference detectors to aid in calibration and artifact reduction. The size of the fan beam and the number of detector elements collecting data depend on the selected scan field of view. [4] Ideal detectors exhibit high efficiency in capturing transmitted photons, minimal afterglow (persistent scintillation), effective scatter suppression, and stability that eliminates frequent calibration interruptions. [5] [6] Overall detector efficiency results from multiple factors, including the stopping power of the detector material, scintillator efficiency (for solid-state detectors), charge collection efficiency (for xenon detectors), geometric efficiency (comparing detector collimator plates to surface area), and scatter rejection. [7] [4] Other terms related to detector efficiency include capture efficiency (the ability to acquire photons), absorption efficiency (the number of absorbed photons), response time (the time for the signal to return to zero after x-ray stimulation), and dynamic range (the ratio of the maximum to minimum measurable signals). [3] [4]
