Ethyl ether was responsible for 3 poisonings, methyl ether for 10 ones. It was found, that the intoxication had four stages or periods (initial, latent, clinical, recovery) and presented with CNS impairment, gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal disorders, decompensated metabolic acidosis, etc. The paper describes two clinical cases and experimental toxicity of cellosolves as well as the effect of the inhibitor of isovaleric acid amide alcohol dehydrogenase on animal lethality. The results obtained support the suggestion of ADH-participated metabolic activation of cellosolves in the body. The prospects of further studies into intoxication pathogenesis and new opportunities for relevant poisoning management are outlined.",

Alprazolam has been used in the treatment of panic disorders and agoraphobia and appears to be more selective in these conditions than other benzodiazepines. The choice of benzodiazepines for anxiety is based on several sound pharmacologic principles: (1) a rapid onset of action; (2) a relatively high therapeutic index (see drug B in Figure 22\u20131), plus availability of flumazenil for treatment of overdose; (3) a low risk of drug interactions based on liver enzyme induction; and (4) minimal effects on cardiovascular or autonomic functions.",

Two cases of serious ventricular arrhythmias associated with magnesium depletion are described. Clinical manifestations are vague but center around neurologic symptoms such as weakness, tremors, stupor, coma, nausea, vomiting and anorexia. Serious cardiac arrhythmias also occur with magnesium depletion. Magnesium appears to be very useful in hypomagnesemic or digitalis-toxic tachyarrhythmias. Magnesium may also be valuable in normomagnesemic tachyarrhythmias. Ten to fifteen milliliters of a 20 percent magnesium sulfate solution, given intravenously over 1 minute, followed by a slow 4 to 6 hour infusion of 500 ml of 2 per cent magnesium sulfate in 5 per cent dextrose in water is recommended. Recurrence of arrhythmias is common and a second infusion of magnesium sulfate may be necessary. Hypermagnesemia occurs frequently in renal insufficiency, and magnesium therapy may then be contraindicated. Serum levels above 5.5 meq/liter should be avoided. Loss of deep tendon reflexes and a decrease in respiratory rate can be used as guides to magnesium therapy. A plea is made for frequent analysis of serum magnesium so that more knowledge can be gained regarding this important biologic element in cardiovascular disorders.",
