In an attempt to assess the effect of donor age on graft survival and subsequent renal function, we analyzed our clinical results in 276 consecutive recipients of living related renal transplants spanning both the cyclosporine and the azathioprine eras, of whom a total of 44 recipients received kidneys from donors over 55 years old. All recipients were otherwise similar in age, race, haplotype mismatch, number of retransplants, and number of pretransplant transfusions, apart from an increased number of diabetics among the CsA-treated recipients of elderly kidneys (38% vs. 14%). The cumulative patient and graft survival rates at 1 and 5 years were independent of donor age whether CsA or AZA was utilized. Nor was the incidence of rejection or infection significantly different in the older donor group when compared with the younger cohort. Short-term and intermediate-term renal function, as assessed by serum creatinine, was however poorer but stable in the older donor group when compared with the younger one. The mean serum creatinine levels at 1 year in the CsA- and AZA-treated recipients of kidneys from older donors were 2.4 and 2.0 mg/dl, respectively, compared with 1.6 and 1.4 mg/dl, respectively, when the donor age was less than 55 years (P less than 0.001). Since renal function at the end of the first posttransplant year is considered a determinant of long-term graft survival, this is a cause for concern, but in view of the universal shortage of organs and the negligible morbidity to donors, renal transplantation from elderly living donors remains an acceptable practice.",
