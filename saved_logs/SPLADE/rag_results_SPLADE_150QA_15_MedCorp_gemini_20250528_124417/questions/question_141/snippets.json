Polycythemia rubra vera and chronic myelogenous leukemia are both myeloproliferative disorders and, as such, share certain clinical features. Although some myeloproliferative disorders may transform into others, conversion of polycythemia rubra vera to chronic myelogenous leukemia has been denied. We report here an elderly man with polycythemia rubra vera and a normal leukocyte alkaline phosphatase who developed chronic myelogenous leukemia with a low leukocyte alkaline phosphatase and a marrow karyotype of 45, X, Ph1-positive. In addition, we have collected evidence of two similar cases and thus conclude that, although uncommon, polycythemia rubra vera may on occasion progress to chronic myelogenous leukemia.",
