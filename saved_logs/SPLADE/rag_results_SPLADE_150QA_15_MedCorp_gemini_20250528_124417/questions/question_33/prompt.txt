Document 1 (Title: [Elderly non-Hodgkin's lymphoma presenting with pulmonary squamous cell carcinoma as a complication of chemotherapy for malignant lymphoma].): The authors report a case of pulmonary squamous cell carcinoma which occurred after chemotherapy of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). A 76-year-old man, who was admitted to our department because of swelling of cervical lymph nodes, was diagnosed as having NHL (follicular mixed cell lymphoma). He was treated with 11 courses of CHOP therapy. Thereafter, chemotherapy including ifosfamide was carried out for approximately three years. In June, 1991, he was readmitted to our department because of swelling and pain in his left thigh and an abnormal shadow on chest X-ray. Chest CT demonstrated a cavitated shadow (about 5 cm in diameter) with an irregular margin in right S1, which was suggested to be lung cancer or pulmonary infiltration of malignant lymphoma. Bronchoscopy, which was carried out on July 12, showed bloody sputa from the right B1 ramus and markedly reddened mucosa at the orifice of the right upper bronchus. Sputum cytology revealed no malignancy. ACVP-16 chemotherapy including ara-C, CBDCA and VP-16 was initiated on July 14 because of enlarged superficial lymph nodes. On July 18, he fell out of bed and fractured his left femur. He also suffered from respiratory failure. He died of pulmonary haemorrhage on July 26. Autopsy revealed pulmonary squamous cell carcinoma. The occurrence of pulmonary squamous cell carcinoma is rare after the chemotherapy of malignant lymphoma.
Document 2 (Title: 38-Year-Old Male Presents With Lower Extremity Edema -- Case Presentation): His physical exam revealed clear lungs and a normal heart exam on auscultation. His abdomen was soft and non-tender, and his skin was warm and dry with no rash. He had 2 plus pitting edema at the ankles. Initial laboratory data was consistent with acute kidney injury (AKI) with worsening creatinine from 1.2 to 1.6 over 1 month and nephrotic range proteinuria. Serologies for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, anti-nuclear antibody (ANA), c-ANCA, serine protease 3 (PR3) IgG, myeloperoxidase antibody (MPO), and complement levels were sent. He was started on losartan for proteinuria with plans for renal biopsy; however, he was lost to follow up. The patient then presented two weeks later with worsening edema to his waist, continued weight gain, mild hemoptysis, and streaks of blood in the stool. Physical examination now showed worsening pitting edema up to his waist with new non-pruritic, erythematous excoriations on the medial aspect of his thighs bilaterally. He was admitted to the hospital with concern for worsening vasculitis. He was started on oral prednisone and underwent a renal biopsy. For his edema, he was started on diuretics to which he responded well. Due to persistent leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing was performed to complete the workup.
Document 3 (Title: Non-Hodgkin lymphoma): Treatment The traditional treatment of NHL includes chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and stem-cell transplants. There have also been developments in immunotherapy used in the treatment of NHL. Chemotherapy The most common chemotherapy used for B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma is R-CHOP, which is a regimen of four drugs (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) plus rituximab.
Document 4 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): A 45-year-old man with no significant medical history was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) 10 days ago after suffering third-degree burns over 40% of his body. He had been relatively stable until the last 24 hours. Now, he is febrile (39.5°C [103.1°F]), and his white blood cell count has risen from 8500 to 20,000/mm3. He has also had an episode of hypo-tension (86/50 mmHg) that responded to a fluid bolus. Blood cultures were obtained at the time of his fever and results are pending. The ICU attending physician is concerned about a bloodstream infection and decides to treat with empiric com-bination therapy directed against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The combination therapy includes tobramycin. The patient weighs 70 kg (154 lb) and has an estimated creatinine clear-ance of 90 mL/min. How should tobramycin be dosed using once-daily and conventional dosing strategies? How should each regimen be monitored for efficacy and toxicity?
Document 5 (Title: [Peripheral blood involvement accompanied with hypercalcemia in the malignant lymphoma of iliac bone].): We reported a rare case of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of iliac bone which developed peripheral blood involvement associated with hypercalcemia. 42-year-old man was admitted to Fukui Medical School Hospital because of right iliac bone pain. An X-ray film of the pelvis disclosed the osteolytic change of right iliac bone. A CT scan of the pelvis showed soft tissue density tumors involved bilateral iliac bone. He had no superficial lymphadenopathy or organomegaly. Examination of peripheral blood and bone marrow did not show any abnormalities. Monoclonal immunoglobulin was not detected in serum. Examination of biopsied specimens from iliac bone tumor showed infiltration of round cells. Immunocytochemical analysis showed only MT-1 positive. He was treated with combination chemotherapy of vindesine, cyclophosphamide, prednisolone and pirarubicin followed by radiation therapy. But, there was no significant response. Following radiation therapy, he developed coma. Serum calcium was 9.8 mEq/l. The pathologic immature cells were found in peripheral blood. The bone marrow aspirates showed 63% pathologic cells. These cells expressed CD19, CD20, HLA-DR antigens. He was diagnosed as having leukemic non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, B-cell type, and was treated with combination chemotherapy. But he died of systemic fungal infection.
Document 6 (Title: 38-Year-Old Male Presents With Lower Extremity Edema -- Case Presentation): A 38-year-old African American male, who emigrated from Somalia 10 years ago, presented with a 6-month history of lower extremity swelling, 20-pound (9 kg) weight gain over 4 weeks, and new-onset microscopic hematuria. He had no prior history of edema, proteinuria, or hematuria. There was no prior history of any systemic illness or any heart, lung, or kidney disease. He reported no over-the-counter drug use, herbal medication use, or NSAID intake. His review of systems was positive for lethargy, fatigue, and edema at his lower extremities. His family history was negative for any kidney disease. He reported a monogamous relationship with his wife and no current or past alcohol or drug use. His medical history included recently diagnosed hypertension, latent tuberculosis, and anemia. His vital signs included a blood pressure of 160/90 and a heart rate of 78.
Document 7 (Title: Biochemistry_Lippinco): 1.2. A 50-year-old man presented with painful blisters on the backs of his hands. He was a golf instructor and indicated that the blisters had erupted shortly after the golfing season began. He did not have recent exposure to common skin irritants. He had partial complex seizure disorder that had begun ~3 years earlier after a head injury. The patient had been taking phenytoin (his only medication) since the onset of the seizure disorder. He admitted to an average weekly ethanol intake of ~18 12-oz cans of beer. The patient’s urine was reddish orange. Cultures obtained from skin lesions failed to grow organisms. A 24-hour urine collection showed elevated uroporphyrin (1,000 mg; normal, <27 mg). The most likely diagnosis is: A. acute intermittent porphyria. B. congenital erythropoietic porphyria. C. erythropoietic protoporphyria. D. hereditary coproporphyria. E. porphyria cutanea tarda.
Document 8 (Title: Primary effusion lymphoma): PEL is generally resistant to cancer chemotherapy drugs that are active against other B-cell lymphomas and therefore carries a poor prognosis. Overall median and 1 year survival rates in a series of 28 patients treated with chemotherapy for PEL were 6.2 months and 39.3%, respectively. In this study, the complete response rate (presumed to be temporary) to a standard CHOP chemotherapeutic regimen (i.e. cyclophosphamide doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) was only 10% whereas a more intensive CHO chemotherapy regimen which included high dose methotrexate and bleomycin achieved a compete response rate (presumed temporary) of 70%. A second study using CHOP-like regimens or one of these regimens plus methotrexate also produced better results with the latter regimens: 5 year survival rates for the CHOP-like and CHOP-like plus methotrexate regimens were 34.4% and 45.7%, respectively. A review of 105 PEL cases reported median survival times, 1 year, 3 year, and 5 year survival rates of
Document 9 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): A 45-year-old man is brought to the local hospital emer-gency department by ambulance. His wife reports that he had been in his normal state of health until 3 days ago when he developed a fever and a productive cough. Dur-ing the last 24 hours he has complained of a headache and is increasingly confused. His wife reports that his medical history is significant only for hypertension, for which he takes hydrochlorothiazide and lisinopril, and that he is allergic to amoxicillin. She says that he developed a rash many years ago when prescribed amoxicillin for bron-chitis. In the emergency department, the man is febrile (38.7°C [101.7°F]), hypotensive (90/54 mmHg), tachypneic (36/min), and tachycardic (110/min). He has no signs of meningismus but is oriented only to person. A stat chest x-ray shows a left lower lung consolidation consistent with pneumonia. A CT scan is not concerning for lesions or elevated intracranial pressure. The plan is to start empiric antibiotics and perform a
Document 10 (Title: CHOP (chemotherapy)): In most other non-Hodgkin lymphomas (excluding some aggressive forms), standard-dose [R]-CHOP is generally used as first-line therapy. Uses and indications Normal cells are more able than cancer cells to repair damage from chemotherapy drugs. This regimen can also be combined with the monoclonal antibody rituximab if the lymphoma is of B cell origin; this combination is called R-CHOP. Typically, courses are administered at an interval of two or three weeks (CHOP-14 and CHOP-21 respectively). A staging CT scan is generally performed after three cycles to assess whether the disease is responding to treatment. In patients with a history of cardiovascular disease, doxorubicin (which is cardiotoxic) is often deemed to be too great a risk and is omitted from the regimen. The combination is then referred to as COP (cyclophosphamide, Oncovin, and prednisone or prednisolone) or CVP (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone or prednisolone).
Document 11 (Title: Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma -- Treatment / Management -- B Cell Lymphoma): Mantle cell lymphoma: Mantle cell lymphoma with multiple areas of involvement is commonly treated with aggressive chemotherapy plus rituximab in eligible patients. Intense chemotherapy regimens such as R-Hyper-CVAD regimen (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin (Adriamycin), and dexamethasone, alternately given with high-dose methotrexate plus cytarabine) + rituximab, alternating RCHOP/RDHAP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone)/(rituximab, dexamethasone, cytarabine, cisplatin), NORDIC regimen (dose-intensified induction immunochemotherapy with rituximab + cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, prednisone [maxi-CHOP]) alternating with rituximab + high-dose cytarabine, or RDHAP (Rituximab, dexamethasone, cytarabine, cisplatin). After the response to initial chemotherapy, high-dose therapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation is undertaken in eligible patients. This is typically followed by maintenance of rituximab for 3 years.
Document 12 (Title: Treatment of CNS involvement of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma with short-term cerebrospinal irradiation, high-dose chemotherapy, and autologous bone marrow transplantation. A case report of a 12-year-old patient.): A 12-year-old patient with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, who developed central nervous system (CNS) relapse, was successfully treated with the following new regimen: cerebrospinal irradiation (CSpRT), high-dose chemotherapy, and autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT). He received remission induction therapy comprising intrathecal methotrexate and systemic chemotherapy, followed by cranial and spinal irradiations in doses of 2,000 cGy in 10 fractions over 5 days, and 1,200 cGy in 6 fractions over 3 days, respectively. He then received chemotherapy comprising 4 infusions of 1 g/m2 cytosine arabinoside and an intravenous injection of 4 mg/kg ACNU. His bone marrow, collected and cryopreserved after the remission induction therapy, was infused immediately after the high-dose chemotherapy. The granulocyte and platelet counts reached the nadir level on days 10 and 6 after ABMT, respectively, gradually recovering to the normal level in about 1 month. Neither severe infection nor bleeding was noted during the aplastic phase. No neurological deficits have been observed for 12 months. The short-time CSpRT and high-dose chemotherapy followed by ABMT are thus demonstrated to reduce neurotoxicities and bone marrow toxicities and to produce a good therapeutic effect against CNS involvement in lymphoma.
Document 13 (Title: Case Study: 32-Year-Old Male Presenting with Right Lower Quadrant Abdominal Pain (Archived) -- Case Presentation): The patient denies prior abdominal surgeries. He does smoke a half pack of cigarettes a day, drinks alcohol socially, and denies any recreational drug use. He notes no inherited medical conditions in his family. Vital signs on arrival: Blood pressure (BP) 120/73 Heart rate (HR) 60 RR 18 Temperature: 35.6 C Oxygen saturation: 98% on room air Height 5'10" (178 cm) Weight 154 lbs (70 kg)
Document 14 (Title: Anatomy_Gray): In all patients back pain requires careful assessment not only of the vertebral column but also of the chest and abdomen in order not to miss other important anatomical structures that may produce signs and symptoms radiating to the back. A 50-year-old man was brought to the emergency department with severe lower back pain that had started several days ago. In the past 24 hours he has had two episodes of fecal incontinence and inability to pass urine and now reports numbness and weakness in both his legs. The attending physician performed a physical examination and found that the man had reduced strength during knee extension and when dorsiflexing his feet and toes. He also had reduced reflexes in his knees and ankles, numbness in the perineal (saddle) region, as well as reduced anal sphincter tone.
Document 15 (Title: Biochemistry_Lippinco): .5. A 67-year-old man presented to the emergency department with a 1-week history of angina and shortness of breath.
