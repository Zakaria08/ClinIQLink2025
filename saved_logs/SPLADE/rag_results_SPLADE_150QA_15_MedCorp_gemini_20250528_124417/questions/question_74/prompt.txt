With your own knowledge and the help of the following document:

Document 1 (Title: Psichiatry_DSM-5): Exact prevalence and incidence of sexual dysfunctions among users of nonpsychiatric medications such as cardiovascular, cytotoxic, gastrointestinal, and hormonal agents are unknown. Elevated rates of sexual dysfunction have been reported with methadone or high-dose opioid drugs for pain. There are increased rates of decreased sexual desire, erec- tile dysfunction, and difficulty reaching orgasm associated with illicit substance use. The prevalence of sexual problems appears related to chronic drug abuse and appears higher amphetamines or 3,4—methylenedioxymethamphetamine (i.e., MDMA, ecstasy). Elevated rates of sexual dysfunction are also seen in individuals receiving methadone but are sel- dom reported by patients receiving buprenorphine. Chronic alcohol abuse and chronic nicotine abuse are related to higher rates of erectile problems.
Document 2 (Title: Dystonia -- History and Physical): Oro-mandibular dystonia can manifest as night-time bruxism (jaw spasms producing forceful jaw closure) and may follow dental procedures, oro-mandibular-facial trauma, or temporomandibular joint dysfunction.
Document 3 (Title: Chronic pain): Dysfunctional dopamine management in the brain could potentially act as a shared mechanism between chronic pain, insomnia and major depressive disorder. Astrocytes, microglia, and Satellite glial cells have also been found to be dysfunctional in chronic pain. Increased activity of microglia, alterations of microglial networks, and increased production of chemokines and cytokines by microglia might aggravate chronic pain. Astrocytes have been observed to lose their ability to regulate the excitability of neurons, increasing spontaneous neural activity in pain circuits. Management
Document 4 (Title: Oculo Auriculo Vertebral Spectrum -- History and Physical -- Oro-craniofacial Anomalies): These are commonly unilateral but can also have a bilateral asymmetrical presentation. The oro-facial anomalies include microsomia, macrostomia, cleft lip, cleft palate, malformation in the epiglottic fold, bifid uvula, jaw protrusion, and malocclusions. Dental abnormalities include delayed tooth development, agenesis of premolars and molars, enamel, and dentin malformations. Parents have also reported speech difficulties, feeding problems in infants, chewing and swallowing problems. Few authors have reported facial palsy, trigeminal anesthesia, and asymmetrical palatal elevation.
Document 5 (Title: Examination, diagnosis and treatment of occlusal pain-dysfunction.): The complaint of chronic oro-facial pain is common, and this often presents as a frsutrating diagnostic problem. Conventional efforts at dental management of chronic pain-dysfunction in the occlusal components, tend to be unrewarding when the tissue degeneration is advanced. However, early treatment and prevention of the signs and symptoms are in the realm of every-day general practice.
Document 6 (Title: Oro-facial pain.): Oro-facial pain is commonly acute, and of dental origin. There are numerous other less common, but clinically identifiable types of oro-facial pain which can be attributed to an organic cause, and which usually respond to the appropriate treatment. There is a small proportion of oro-facial pain problems, however, which are chronic and which are found to have a psychogenic element of greater or lesser magnitude, and treatment is aimed at psychological or psychiatric therapy. The interim results of an ongoing study of chronic oro-facial pain of psychogenic origin are described in this presentation.
Document 7 (Title: Symphysis pubis dysfunction): Unnecessary radiation from medical imaging is avoided during pregnancy, so in most cases a physical examination and history are considered sufficient to refer to physical therapy. Treatment A promising treatment for chronic or post natal dysfunction is prolotherapy. Other treatments include the use of elbow crutches, pelvic support devices and prescribed pain relief. The majority of problems will resolve spontaneously after delivery. There are two case studies that show reduction of pain and dysfunction with conservative chiropractic care. Physical therapists—especially those specializing in pelvic floor physical therapy—can assist with pain relief techniques, provide manual therapy to alleviate related muscle spasms, and manage exercise protocols. While most pregnancy-related cases are reported to resolve postpartum, definitive diagnosis and treatment are still appropriate in order to optimize comfort and function and ensure a good course of recovery.
Document 8 (Title: Nafarelin): Side effects Side effects of nafarelin are related to sex hormone deficiency and include hot flashes, vaginal dryness, headaches, mood changes, and sexual dysfunction. Nafarelin causes erectile dysfunction in more than half of men with benign prostatic hyperplasia treated with it. Some people may experience acne, muscle pain, reduced breast size, and nasal irritation. These side effects are reversible and should resolve after stopping the medication. There is a case report of severe hyperkalemia during nafarelin therapy in a woman with uterine fibroids. The mechanism is unknown. Pharmacology
Document 9 (Title: Correction of myopathic face associated with myotonic muscular dystrophy. A case report.): Two cases of myotonic muscular dystrophy manifested oro-facial disharmony and dento-labial dysfunction. Le Fort I osteotomy, sagittal osteotomy of the mandible, genioplasty and wedge excisions of the mucosa of the lower lip were performed on both patients. The desired results with regard to oro-facial appearance and dento-labial function were achieved in both patients after follow-up periods of six and twelve months.
Document 10 (Title: Neurology_Adams): HLA-B8 and -DR3 haplotypes, as occurs in other autoimmune diseases, which are discussed further on. Myasthenia gravis, as the name implies, formerly had a grave prognosis, perhaps less so today but still associated with considerable morbidity. As mentioned, repeated or persistent activity of a muscle group exhausts contractile power, leading to a progressive paresis, and rest restores strength, at least partially. These features, concentrated in the palpebral, ocular, and the oro-facial-lingual muscles are the identifying attributes of the disease and their demonstration is usually enough to establish the diagnosis on clinical grounds.
Document 11 (Title: Neurology_Adams): Other Disturbances of Antidiuretic Hormone and Thirst Conditions have been described in which the osmoreceptor control of ADH and of thirst appear to be dissociated. As reported by Hayes and coworkers, rare patients have been reported to repeatedly developed severe hypernatremia (levels as high as 180 to 190 mEq/L), presenting with confusion and stupor. Although the patient reported was able to initiate a release of ADH, his thirst mechanism was nonfunctional. Only when the patient was compelled to drink water at regular intervals did his serum sodium fall. Robertson and others have described similar cases with abnormalities of thirst causing a type of “central” or “essential” hypernatremia.

Document 12 (Title: Low power laser biostimulation of chronic oro-facial pain. A double-blind placebo controlled cross-over study in 40 patients.): The efficacy of low power laser stimulation in the treatment of chronic oro-facial pain conditions was investigated in a double-blind placebo controlled modified cross-over study in 40 patients. The laser was an invisible infrared (IR) diode laser with an emission at 904 nanometer (nm). Treatment effect was evaluated by means of VAS-scales and global assessment of pain. Outcome of treatment was correlated to changes in urinary excretion of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA). The clinical impression was that placebo was superior to laser stimulation. No statistically significant difference between the analgesic effect of the laser and placebo irradiation was found on VAS-scales. A significant (P = 0.05) increase in 5-HIAA excretion was found in the placebo group. It is concluded that the possibility of a substantial placebo response should be taken into consideration using 904 nm (IR) lasers for pain treatment in patients with this type of chronic oro-facial pain.
Document 13 (Title: Pelvic floor dysfunction): Some lifestyle behaviors can lead to pelvic floor dysfunction. This includes avoiding urinating or bowel movements, obesity, use of muscle relaxants or narcotics, and use of antihistamines or anticholinergics. Using muscle relaxants or narcotics can lead to increased smooth and skeletal muscle relaxation, potentially related to urinary incontinence. Antihistamines and anticholinergics have additive effects that lead to urinary hesitancy and retention, ultimately leading to pelvic floor dysfunction. Urinary incontinence can also affect athletes, especially those in sports that require high impact such as jumping. Gymnasts, for example, report a high prevalence of urinary incontinence. Studies show that athletes in sports requiring high spinal stability may also suffer from this condition, as the activation of abdominal wall muscles can cause urinary alterations during activities. In some cases, sexual abuse can also be associated with chronic pelvic pain and pelvic floor dysfunction.
Document 14 (Title: Osteopathic Manipulative Treatment: Facial Muscle Energy, Direct MFR, and BLT Procedure – for TMJ Dysfunction -- Introduction): Dentists have reported TMJ dysfunction in dental literature since the 1950s, initially termed temporomandibular dysfunction; it involved malocclusion of the teeth (imbalance between the upper and lower teeth). Experts later discovered that this mechanism alone was insufficient to account for all clinical findings in the condition. About 20 years later, in 1979, it was conceptually designated as an orthopedic condition. TMJ disorders are still coined temporomandibular disorders (TMD), containing all TMJ problems and related structures. OMT (osteopathic manipulative therapy) mobilizes the compromised TMJ through the dysfunctional pathologic barrier (not after its usual physiological barrier), leading to low injury reports of OMT procedures. This review explores the usage of OMT in treating TMD. [2] [3]
Document 15 (Title: Hypnotherapy in the treatment of oro-facial pain.): A continuing study at the Oro-Facial Pain Clinic. The Royal Dental Hospital of Melbourne has demonstrated that hypnotherapy is a useful tool in the management of previously resistant, chronic facial pain disorders, discomfort conditions and dental phobic illness.
