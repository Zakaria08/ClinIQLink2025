        "title": "Prophylactic ankle bracing.",
        "content": "Many choices are available to athletes seeking an ankle support. The time-honored tradition of ankle taping with adhesive tape does offer protection against ankle sprains during activity. Laced stabilizers offer an equal or possibly greater amount of support, are less costly and easier to apply, and can be retightened frequently during activity. The physician should become familiar with one of these two methods and choose one based on availability and feasibility in the community. The air stirrup may be indicated for patients with a history of ankle injury who are undergoing a graduated rehabilitation program. Nevertheless, the air stirrup has not been shown to provide significantly greater inversion restriction than taping or lace-on braces and is not recommended as a first-line method of support for individuals with no history of recent ankle sprain. High-top shoes are better when the ankle is taped, although low-top shoes are better when a laced stabilizer is worn. Elastic guards help reduce ankle edema but do not provide ankle stability.",

        "title": "Programmed cell death",
        "content": "Basic morphological and biochemical features of PCD have been conserved in both plant and animal kingdoms. Specific types of plant cells carry out unique cell-death programs. These have common features with animal apoptosis\u2014for instance, nuclear DNA degradation\u2014but they also have their own peculiarities, such as nuclear degradation triggered by the collapse of the vacuole in tracheary elements of the xylem. Janneke Balk and Christopher J. Leaver, of the Department of Plant Sciences, University of Oxford, carried out research on mutations in the mitochondrial genome of sun-flower cells. Results of this research suggest that mitochondria play the same key role in vascular plant PCD as in other eukaryotic cells.",

        "title": "Necrosis -- Mechanisms",
        "content": "Necrotic death is almost always associated with an inflammatory response. Necrotic cells release factors like high mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1), and hepatoma-derived growth factor (HDGF). [18] [19] These factors are sensed by a nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3), which is a core protein of the inflammasome. [20] This results\u00a0in inflammasome activation and causes the release of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL1\u03b2. NLRP3 inflammasome\u00a0activation is triggered mainly through ATP produced by mitochondria released from damaged cells. [21] Necrosis does not typically correlate with activation of caspases, and it appears that it causes cell demise in response to damage or pathology, but not during normal development. Despite this, it turns out that a programmed form of necrotic death (termed necroptosis ) is very common in vivo, mainly in diverse forms of neurodegeneration and death inflicted by ischemia or infection. Unlike unordered necrosis, necroptosis is a more physiological and programmed type of necroptotic death and shares several key processes with apoptosis. It occurs due to the activation of the kinase domain of the receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1) and the assembly of the RIP1/RIP3-containing signaling complex. It\u00a0is triggered by tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family members, needs\u00a0caspase 8 inhibition, and assembly of necrosome (RIPK1-RIPK3 complex IIb). [9] [19]",
