Document 1 (Title: Ontogeny of hepatic bovine growth hormone receptors in cattle.): A series of studies examined the binding characteristics and ontogeny of hepatic growth hormone binding sites in dairy bulls on d 2, 30, 180, and 365 of age. Binding of iodinated recombinant bovine growth hormone ([125I]rbGH) to liver membrane receptors was membrane protein-dependent. Receptors were considered growth hormone-specific, because physiological concentrations of bovine prolactin (bPRL) failed to displace [125I]rbGH from bovine hepatocyte membranes. Only 50% of [125I]rbGH was bound reversibly to hepatic microsomes. Addition of dithiothreitol (DTT) to the receptor-assay buffer increased the binding of [125I]rbGH to hepatic membranes in a time-dependent manner. Moderate concentrations of Ca++ and Mg++ in the receptor-assay buffer had no detectable effects on binding of [125I]rbGH to hepatic microsomes. In growing dairy bulls, specific binding of [125I]rbGH per milligram of membrane protein increased from 1.9 +/- 1.8% at d 2 to 14.1 +/- 1.8% at d 180 and then declined to 5.2 +/- 1.6% at d 365. Likewise, concentration of insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I in serum was low during the 1st mo of age (d 2, 13.3 +/- 8.8 ng/ml; d 30, 9.7 +/- 8.8 ng/ml), but it became maximal at d 180 (151.0 +/- 8.8 ng/ml). Circulating concentrations of IGF-II increased linearly during the 1st yr of growth. Serum concentrations of GH, triiodothyronine, and thyroxine declined from 39.9 +/- 6.5, 2.7 +/- .2, and 75.4 +/- 4.6 ng/ml at d 2 to 16.5 +/- 6.5, 1.3 +/- .2, and 53.4 +/- 4.6 ng/ml at d 30, respectively, and remained low through 1 yr of age. Insulin concentration in serum did not change significantly with development. Results indicated that increasing concentrations of specific bGH receptors in the bovine liver may play a key role in regulating postnatal growth in cattle.
Document 2 (Title: Physiology, Pituitary Hormones -- Mechanism -- Growth Hormone): Growth Hormone has a direct and indirect mechanism of action. The direct effect of growth hormone involves growth hormone directly binding to its receptors on target cells to stimulate a response. The indirect effect is mediated by the action of insulin-like growth factor-1(IGF-1), which is secreted by the liver hepatocytes in response to growth hormone. Insulin-like growth factor-1 binds to its receptor, IGF-1R, on the cellular surface. It activates a tyrosine kinase-mediated intracellular signaling pathway that phosphorylates various proteins intracellularly, leading to increased anabolism, cellular replication and division, and metabolism.

Document 3 (Title: Growth hormone): Because polypeptide hormones are not fat-soluble, they cannot penetrate cell membranes. Thus, GH exerts some of its effects by binding to receptors on target cells, where it activates the MAPK/ERK pathway. Through this mechanism GH directly stimulates division and multiplication of chondrocytes of cartilage. GH also stimulates, through the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, the production of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1, formerly known as somatomedin C), a hormone homologous to proinsulin. The liver is a major target organ of GH for this process and is the principal site of IGF-1 production. IGF-1 has growth-stimulating effects on a wide variety of tissues. Additional IGF-1 is generated within target tissues, making it what appears to be both an endocrine and an autocrine/paracrine hormone. IGF-1 also has stimulatory effects on osteoblast and chondrocyte activity to promote bone growth.
