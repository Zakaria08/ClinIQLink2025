        "title": "[Towards unity in Hippocratic medicine: Airs, eaux, lieux, et Maladies I].",
        "content": "The treatises De aeris locis (related to Cos) and De morbis I (attributed to Cnide) are often considered rivals by the Hippocratic criticism which still admits the existence of an ideological conflict between the authors. However, the comparative study of the different passages reveals a doctrinal identity which cannot be justified, as required by the traditional criticism, merely by the influence of one school on the other. So, besides an identical and etiological pattern (external and released causes and internal and humoural causes) the physiology of the two treatises is controlled by the same physical principles, those used by the Milesian physiologists to explain the water cycle and rain formation: the process of the disease is in fact related to cosmo-meteorological phenomena. It appears that their medical concepts, to which the physikoi contributed, have been elaborated from a micro-macrocosmic method: the microcosmic man is directed by the same laws as the macrocosmic universe. We are dealing in both treatises with a medicine based on a cosmological principle.",

        "title": "Neuroanatomy, Pupillary Light Reflexes and Pathway -- Clinical Significance -- Optic Nerve",
        "content": "A lesion in the optic nerve anterior to the optic chiasm leads to vision loss in the ipsilateral eye. Damage to the right optic nerve will result in the right anopia and compromise the entire visual field in the right eye. Damage to the optic nerve will also affect the pupillary reflex pathway. When a light is shined in the left eye with a damaged optic nerve, the light will not project to the retina for further response and pupillary constriction will be absent in both eyes. When a light is shined in the other eye without a damaged optic nerve, bilateral pupillary constriction will occur, which confirms that the optic nerve, not the oculomotor nerve, is damaged in the left eye.",

        "content": "In February 2006, American Eagle launched the aerie lingerie sub-brand, targeting the American 15- to 22-year-old female demographic segment. In addition to lingerie such as a wide variety of bras and other undergarments, the aerie line sells dorm wear, active apparel, loungewear, accessories and sleepwear. What started as a sub-brand quickly became a standalone concept in its own right, featuring a complete fitness line, called aerie f.i.t. The aerie brand is sold in American Eagle Outfitters stores, on-line through the American Eagle Web site, and in stand-alone aerie retail stores. The first stand-alone aerie store opened in August 2006 in Greenville, South Carolina, and was followed by two more test stores later that year. As of December 2010, there were 147 stand-alone aerie stores in the United States and in Canada.",
