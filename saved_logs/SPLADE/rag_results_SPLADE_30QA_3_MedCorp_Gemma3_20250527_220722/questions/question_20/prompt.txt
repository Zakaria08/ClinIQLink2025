Document 1 (Title: Amphetamine-Related Psychiatric Disorders -- Introduction): The routes of amphetamine administration may be inhalation, intravenous, intramuscular, or transmucosal (oral/nasal). Peak plasma levels can range from 5 to 10 minutes via intravenous administration and up to 2 to 3 hours if taken transmucosal. Symptoms typically last hours to days, based on dosage and strength, and dissipate once the drug is eliminated from the body. Given the acute symptoms associated with amphetamine intoxication, it is difficult for the clinician to distinguish amphetamine-associated psychosis from the acute psychosis of a primary mental disorder. Most agree that psychosis following amphetamine use is characterized by persecutory delusions, visual hallucinations, and symptoms resembling acute psychosis most commonly observed in schizophrenia.
Document 2 (Title: Conversion disorder): The diagnostic criteria for functional neurological symptom disorder, as set out in DSM-5, are: Specify type of symptom or deficit as: With weakness or paralysis With abnormal movement (e.g. tremor, dystonic movement, myoclonus, gait disorder) With swallowing symptoms With speech symptoms (e.g. dysphonia, slurred speech) With attacks or seizures With amnesia or memory loss With special sensory loss symptoms (e.g. visual blindness, olfactory loss, or hearing disturbance) With mixed symptoms. Specify if: Acute episode: symptoms present for less than six months Persistent: symptoms present for six months or more. Specify if: Psychological stressor (conversion disorder) No psychological stressor (functional neurological symptom disorder) Exclusion of neurological disease
Document 3 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): For control of ethanol or other sedative-hypnotic withdrawal states widely used for the management of acute anxiety states and for rapid control of panic attacks. They are also used, though less commonly, in the long-term management of GAD and panic disorders. Anxiety symptoms may be relieved by many benzodiazepines, but it is not always easy to demonstrate the superiority of one drug over another. Alprazolam has been used in the treatment of panic disorders and agoraphobia and appears to be more selective in these conditions than other benzodiazepines. The choice of benzodiazepines for anxiety is based on several sound pharmacologic principles: (1) a rapid onset of action; (2) a relatively high therapeutic index (see drug B in Figure 22–1), plus availability of flumazenil for treatment of overdose; (3) a low risk of drug interactions based on liver enzyme induction; and (4) minimal effects on cardiovascular or autonomic functions.
