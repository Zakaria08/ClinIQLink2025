        "content": "Missense and nonsense mutations in the apoA-I gene are present in some patients with low plasma levels of HDL-C (usually 15\u201330 mg/ dL), but are a rare cause of low plasma HDL-C levels. Most individuals with low plasma HDL-C levels due to missense mutations in apoA-I do not appear to have premature CHD. Patients who are heterozygous for an Arg173Cys substitution in apoA-I (so-called apoA-IMilano) have very low plasma levels of HDL-C due to impaired LCAT activation and accelerated clearance of the HDL particles containing the abnormal apoA-I. Despite having very low plasma levels of HDL-C, these individuals do not have an increased risk of premature CHD. A few selected missense mutations in apoA-I and apoA-II promote the formation of amyloid fibrils, which can cause systemic amyloidosis.",

        "title": "Determinants of carotid intima-media thickness: a population-based ultrasonography study in eastern Finnish men.",
        "content": "We investigated the determinants of maximal intima-media thickness of common carotid arteries in a population-based sample of 1224 Eastern Finnish men aged 42, 48, 54 or 60 years. A high-resolution B-mode ultrasonographic examination was performed as part of the Kuopio Ischaemic Heart Disease Risk Factor Study (KIHD). The maximal intima-media thickness (IMT) varied between 0.48 mm and 4.09 mm (mean value +/- SD, 0.94 mm +/- 0.38 mm). Age (standardized partial coefficient, beta = 0.238, P less than 0.0001), ambulatory pulse pressure (beta = 0.130, P less than 0.0001), cigarette-years of smoking (beta = 0.125, P less than 0.0001), serum LDL cholesterol concentration (beta = 0.125, P less than 0.0001), history of ischaemic heart disease (beta = 0.125, P less than 0.0001), pre-exercise systolic blood pressure (beta = 0.070, P = 0.0113) and diabetes (beta = 0.068, P = 0.0072) were most strongly associated with IMT. This study confirms the role of systolic blood pressure, smoking and serum LDL cholesterol levels as major risk factors for increased carotid intima-media thickness.",
