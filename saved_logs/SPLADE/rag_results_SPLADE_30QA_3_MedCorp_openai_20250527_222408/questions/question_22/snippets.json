Reversed-phase chromatography employs a polar (aqueous) mobile phase. As a result, hydrophobic molecules in the polar mobile phase tend to adsorb to the hydrophobic stationary phase, and hydrophilic molecules in the mobile phase will pass through the column and are eluted first. Hydrophobic molecules can be eluted from the column by decreasing the polarity of the mobile phase using an organic (non-polar) solvent, which reduces hydrophobic interactions. The more hydrophobic the molecule, the more strongly it will bind to the",

        "content": "The chromatographic behaviour of nitrophenols on thin layers of silica gel and cellulose was compared, both without impregnation and impregnated with non-aqueous polar stationary phases (formamide, dimethylformamide) and less polar stationary phases (liquid paraffin, octan-1-ol, 1-bromonaphthalene). Cellulose is preferred when using formamide or dimethylformamide if a pure partition process is required. For each particular analyte a certain amount of the stationary phase is always required to suppress the adsorption activity of silica gel. Separation by reversed-phase thin-layer chromatography is strongly affected by the type of stationary phase (the possibility of forming charge-transfer complexes with 1-bromonaphthalene) and its support (the acidic properties of silica gel and its adsorption activity), the mobile phase (content of organic modifier, pH, presence of salts) and the properties of the solutes (polarity, ionizability).",
