Based on the following information:

Document 1 (Title: Physiology, Pituitary Hormones -- Mechanism -- Growth Hormone): Growth Hormone has a direct and indirect mechanism of action. The direct effect of growth hormone involves growth hormone directly binding to its receptors on target cells to stimulate a response. The indirect effect is mediated by the action of insulin-like growth factor-1(IGF-1), which is secreted by the liver hepatocytes in response to growth hormone. Insulin-like growth factor-1 binds to its receptor, IGF-1R, on the cellular surface. It activates a tyrosine kinase-mediated intracellular signaling pathway that phosphorylates various proteins intracellularly, leading to increased anabolism, cellular replication and division, and metabolism. [2]
Document 2 (Title: Physiology, Growth Hormone -- Function): HGH has two mechanisms of effect: direct action and indirect action. The direct effects of HGH on the body are through its action on binding to target cells to stimulate a response. The indirect effects occur primarily by the action of insulin-like growth factor-1, which hepatocytes primarily secrete in response to elevated HGH binding to surface receptors. Once activated, the Janus activating tyrosine kinases (JAKs) 1 and 2 will bind to the latent cytoplasmic transcriptions factors STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5, and be transported into the nucleus inducing increased gene transcription and metabolism to produce insulin-like growth factor-1 for release into the circulation. Insulin-like growth factor-1 then has an impact on the growth and metabolism of peripheral tissues. One can think of the effects of HGH as a combined effect of both HGH and insulin-like growth factor-1.
Document 3 (Title: Anatomy, Adenohypophysis (Pars Anterior, Anterior Pituitary) -- Structure and Function -- Growth Hormone (GH)/Somatotropin): The growth hormone exerts its effects on many tissues. Growth hormone promotes linear growth via: The stimulation of protein synthesis Increasing the transport of amino acid through the cells [10] GH stimulates the many tissues and the liver to produce somatomedins. Somatomedin helps stimulate cell division and cell proliferation. Somatomedins have the following effects: Enhance T-cell proliferation Increase in the absorption of calcium from the intestines and decrease the loss from urinary excretion Stimulates hepatic glycogenolysis to raise levels of glucose in the blood Increase in the growth of soft and skeletal tissues Increase uptake of non-esterified fatty acids by the muscle.
