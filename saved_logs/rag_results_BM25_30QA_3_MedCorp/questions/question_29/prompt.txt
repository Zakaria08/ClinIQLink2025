Based on the following information:

Document 1 (Title: Perioperative Anticoagulation Management -- Pathophysiology -- Direct Inhibitors of Thrombin): Dabigatran is the only medication in this group. Its mechanism of action is the direct inhibition of thrombin, preventing the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin and, thus, clot formation. Dabigatran has a quick onset of action (0.5 to 2 hours) and is metabolized by non-specific plasma esterases. The plasma half-life is around 12 hours; however, the half-life of this drug is tremendously affected by renal function, as its excretion is 80% by the kidneys and less than 10% by the liver. It is recommended to avoid dabigatran use with creatinine clearance (CrCl) less than 30ml/min due to the potential for drug accumulation and adverse effects of bleeding (see Table. Pharmacological Characteristics of Direct Oral Anticoagulation DOACs Drugs).
Document 2 (Title: End-of-Life Evaluation and Management of Pain -- Treatment / Management -- Pharmacological Management of Pain): The selection of an opiate agent should take into account the individual needs of the patient. The mechanically ventilated patient can get fentanyl or hydromorphone due to the fast action and easy titration. Patients with renal and hepatic insufficiency should get IV Fentanyl with doses adjusted. Remifentanil can also be used because its metabolism is not dependent on hepatic or renal function. It is metabolized by nonspecific plasma esterases located primarily within erythrocytes. Patients who require frequent neurological checks can also benefit from remifentanil due to its ultra-short duration of action. Patients with hemodynamic instability or bronchospasm should not receive morphine sulfate as it causes histamine release. Meperidine should be avoided in patients with renal and hepatic failure because of severe neurotoxicity from the accumulation of an active metabolite. Codeine is another medication with limited use at the end of life with a high incidence of constipation. Approximately 10% of the population lacks the enzyme necessary to convert codeine (a prodrug) to morphine, leading to insufficient analgesia. [20]
Document 3 (Title: Metoprolol -- Mechanism of Action -- Pharmacokinetics): Metabolism: Metoprolol is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2D6. [24] Then it undergoes oxidative deamination and O-demethylation to form several inactive metabolites, such as alpha-hydroxy-metoprolol and 4’-hydroxy-metoprolol. Metoprolol is a racemic mixture of R- and S-enantiomers with different pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. The R-enantiomer is more potent and selective for β-1 receptors than the S-enantiomer; it is also more prone to metabolism by CYP2D6. The S-enantiomer has a longer half-life and higher plasma concentration than the R-enantiomer. The metabolism of metoprolol is influenced by genetic polymorphism of CYP2D6, which can result in poor, intermediate, extensive, or ultra-rapid metabolizers. Poor metabolizers have higher plasma levels and longer half-lives of metoprolol than extensive ones, while ultra-rapid metabolizers have lower plasma levels and shorter half-lives than extensive ones. [23]
