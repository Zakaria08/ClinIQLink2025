A primary method HMOs use to achieve these goals is to coordinate health services and care provided to patients. [15] Such care coordination requires collaboration among various members of the care team. Multiple strategies have sought to attempt to improve care coordination in managed care organizations such as HMOs. For example, explicitly defining the responsibility of each member of the care team is thought to improve coordination among members. [16] Financial risk-sharing strategies, such as bundled payments and capitated payments, shared among different care team members, can also incentivize increased collaboration for cost-efficient care. [17] Additionally, pharmacies have attempted to control costs without compromising care by using techniques such as drug formularies and prescribing protocols. [17] Ultimately, strategies that can incentivize communication among the various members of the care team and further align their goals can improve care coordination within an HMO.",
