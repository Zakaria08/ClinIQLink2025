Based on the following information:

Document 1 (Title: Metronidazole -- Continuing Education Activity): Objectives: Describe the indications to begin metronidazole therapy.

Document 2 (Title: Dental Infections -- Treatment / Management -- When to Prescribe Antibiotics): Dental infections are polymicrobial, caused by a mixture of anaerobic and aerobic bacteria. [22] The selected antimicrobial must target these bacteria. For outpatients, combining penicillin, usually amoxicillin, with a beta-lactamase inhibitor provides appropriate coverage. [1] [22] An alternate antimicrobial is metronidazole, which has improved pharmacokinetics and is better tolerated than erythromycin. Metronidazole is indicated as a first-line treatment when patients are allergic to penicillin, received penicillin recently for another infection, or if the infection is caused by predominantly anaerobic bacteria, which is confirmed with culture. Metronidazole is also used in combination with penicillin in severe spreading infections.
Document 3 (Title: Texas Human Trafficking -- Evaluation -- Motivational interviewing): O : Use o pen-ended questions to allow patients to give more information such as their feelings instead of just "yes" or "no." A: Provide the patient with a ffirmations such as statements of understanding and emphasize that being a victim is not their fault. R: R eflections on what the patient has said to allow them to continue personal exploration. S: S ummarize what the patient has said. [18]
