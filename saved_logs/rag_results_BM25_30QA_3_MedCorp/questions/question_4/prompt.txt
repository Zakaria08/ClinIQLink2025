Based on the following information:

Document 1 (Title: Listeria Monocytogenes -- Etiology): Listeria commonly causes meningitis in the young (neonates), elderly, and immunocompromised patient population. Healthy individuals infected with L. monocytogenes typically have a self-limiting gastrointestinal infection with fever and diarrhea. The Listeria family consists of 10 different species with L. monocytogenes found most consistently in humans. L. monocytogenes has 13 different serotypes based on a variety of flagellar and surface antigens.  However, there are only three serotypes (1/2a, 1/2b, 4a) that inflict disease in humans. [3] In general, the infectious dose of L. monocytogenes is large, meaning one must ingest a large number to cause clinical infection, but as growth and division can continue at refrigerator temperatures, these levels can be reached despite typical food storage precautions. Host immune response also affects the infectious dose. Utilization of proton pump inhibitors or other stomach acid suppression modalities makes it easier for L. monocytogenes to pass through the stomach and invade enterocytes.
Document 2 (Title: Bacterial Meningitis -- Etiology): Listeria monocytogenes and gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli , Klebsiella , Enterobacter , Pseudomonas aeruginosa are other less common causes. Hemophilus influenzae is still occasionally encountered in nonvaccinated individuals. Nosocomial infections are caused by S. pneumonia , Staphylococcus aureus , Staphylococcus albus , and gram-negative bacilli. As per Thigpen etal. out of the 1670 cases reported in the U.S. during 2003–2007, S. pneumoniae was the predominant infective species (58.0%), followed by GBS (18.1%), N. meningitidis (13.9%), H. influenzae (6.7%), and L. monocytogenes (3.4%). [4] Infectious meningitis may also be caused by viruses, fungi, and protozoa. Meningitis may also be non-infectious in etiology and can be caused by cancer, medications, or inflammatory conditions.

Document 3 (Title: Bacterial Diarrhea -- History and Physical -- Listeria s pecies): Listeria monocytogenes is the only member of the Listeria species that regularly infects humans. The organism most commonly thrives in soil and decaying vegetable matter and can survive and multiply at refrigerator temperatures. Infection is due to oral ingestion. Immunosuppression, pregnancy, and extremes of age increase the risk of disease from this infection, with pregnant patients accounting for a third of all cases. [27] Listeria can cross the placenta and infect the fetus during maternal bacteremia.
