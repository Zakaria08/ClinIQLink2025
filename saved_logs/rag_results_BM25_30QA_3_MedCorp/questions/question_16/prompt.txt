Based on the following information:

Document 1 (Title: Small Bowel Bleeding -- Evaluation -- Push Enteroscopy): Push enteroscopy or double-balloon enteroscopy is a new advancement to standard endoscopes. They have been used when the lesion is farther down in the small bowel and not seen with the standard endoscopes. It uses two balloons, which can help the scope be pushed farther into the small bowel. [22] It is possible to see the lesions, as far as the ileum, depending upon the performer's expertise. The advantage is the ability to treat, take biopsies and mark the area with the tattoo. Studies have shown that the enteroscope has identified the bleeding source in about 74% of patients and treated about 60% to 70%. [23]
Document 2 (Title: A Review of Hereditary Colorectal Cancers -- Etiology -- High-Penetrance Genetic Syndromes): Hamartomatous polyps in the small bowel are usually diagnosed with small-bowel capsule endoscopy or double-balloon enteroscopy. Double-balloon enteroscopy also enables therapeutic interventions, such as polypectomy. These lesions may lead to several complications, such as bleeding, obstruction, and intussusception. The risk of colorectal, gastric, small bowel, and pancreatic cancers is elevated, [37] [38] with the incidence of cancer rising significantly after age 50. [39] Screening for pancreatic cancer using endoscopic ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography is recommended in adults. [40] The diagnosis is established based on the following criteria: [41]
Document 3 (Title: Angiodysplasia -- Evaluation): Small bowel angiodysplasia as a source of obscure GI bleeding may require further evaluation with wireless video capsule endoscopy or deep bowel enteroscopy (single or double-balloon enteroscopy) if the initial workup is negative.
