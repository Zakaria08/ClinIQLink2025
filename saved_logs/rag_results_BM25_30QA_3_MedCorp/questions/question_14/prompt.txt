Based on the following information:

Document 1 (Title: Percutaneous Gastrostomy and Jejunostomy -- Technique or Treatment): The "pull" technique is most commonly used and was initially introduced by Gauderer et al. A string is attached to a needle and inserted via the abdominal wall into the stomach. It is grasped with endoscopic biopsy forceps or a snare, and then the endoscope is retracted, taking out the string through the esophagus and mouth. Then the string is attached to the external end of the PEG tube, and the string is pulled back through the abdominal wall. This results in pulling the tube from the mouth to the esophagus, the stomach, and then outside the body through the abdominal wall. [9]
Document 2 (Title: Glossectomy -- Technique or Treatment -- Transcervical Pull-Through Glossectomy Approach): Glossectomy via transcervical pull-through is an alternative resection technique to transoral glossectomy and lip-split mandibulotomy. This approach is a combined transoral/transcervical technique whereby the tongue, floor of the mouth, and the sublingual compartment are released through the submental and submandibular compartments into the neck. Compared to transoral glossectomy alone, this technique provides better exposure for a posterior resection. Transoral glossectomy can be converted to a pull-through without adding a significant time to the procedure. The exposure is not as wide as the lip-split mandibulotomy. However, transcervical pull-through does not require a mandibular osteotomy, thus avoiding the added procedure time for mandibular reconstruction and its associated complications. Flap inset requires thoughtful and disciplined closure to reduce the risk of a postoperative fistula.
Document 3 (Title: Swimmer's Shoulder -- Pathophysiology): Swimming strokes can be broken down into pull-through and recovery phases. The latissimus dorsi and the pectoralis major are the primary contributors to the propulsive forces of the swim stroke through adduction and internal rotation. The subscapularis and serratus anterior muscles also play an integral role in the freestyle stroke. [2] [21] [22] [19] The freestyle stroke can be divided into six distinct parts/phases: Hand entry Forward reach Pull through Middle pull through Hand exit Middle recovery
