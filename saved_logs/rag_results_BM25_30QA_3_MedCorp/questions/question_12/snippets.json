This chart\u00a0displays a capital letter E facing in various directions. While observing each character, the patient points in the direction that the E is facing. Landolt C: Comparable to the Tumbling E, this chart\u00a0displays a C - which some say\u00a0appears more similar to\u00a0a broken ring -\u00a0facing in various directions.\u00a0The chart was developed by the Swiss ophthalmologist Landolt and is\u00a0regarded as\u00a0a laboratory standard by the International Council of Ophthalmology. LEA Symbols Chart : This chart was designed for visual acuity screening in children to eliminate the problems of language barriers. The chart utilizes symbols and creates a play environment to entertain the pediatric patient during the exam. Vivekanand\u00a0et al.\u00a0determined that the LEA symbols chart performs better than the Snellen chart for visual acuity assessments in preschool children. [4]",

Behavioral pattern assessment, through techniques like the Cardiff acuity test and optokinetic drum test, evaluates visual function indirectly by observing the child's response to visual stimuli.

        "content": "In the 1800s, there was a move to standardize visual testing, which led to the formation of several visual acuity charts with different optotypes. The first and still most widely used today is the Snellen chart. Other testing charts developed around that time include the Tumbling E chart, Landolt C chart, and Allen chart. More recently, the LogMAR chart (also known as ETDRS chart) has gained favor. The LogMAR chart provides more accurate results when compared to other visual acuity charts, and the results are more easily used in vision analysis, making it the preferred chart in clinical studies.
