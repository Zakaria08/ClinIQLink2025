Based on the following information:

Document 1 (Title: Histology, Osteoblasts -- Clinical Significance -- Osteoblast Markers): Many serum biomarkers of osteoblast function exist. These include osteoprotegerin (OPG), receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), bone alkaline phosphatase (B-ALP), osteocalcin, procollagen type 1 carboxy-terminal propeptide (P1CP) and procollagen type 1 amino-terminal propeptide (P1NP). [21] [52] Seldomly are the majority of these markers utilized clinically to measure osteoblast function due to cost, analytical inconsistencies, and undetermined clinical significance. [53] [54] [55] Osteocalcin is the most specific marker for osteoblastic activity. [38]
Document 2 (Title: Histology, Osteoblasts -- Histochemistry and Cytochemistry -- Cytochemistry): ALP is a membrane-bound metalloenzyme that is instrumental in catalyzing the hydrolysis of phosphate monoesters. Depending on the site of tissue expression, one of four ALP glycoprotein isozymes is present. Specifically, bone contains a heat-labile isozyme that is a tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase (TNSALP or liver/bone/kidney - L/B/K). Slight variations exist between the L/B/K ALPs from different tissues. [17] ALP is a major enzymatic measure of osteoblastic activity and is more specific in identifying osteoblasts. [18] [19] In vitro, ALP activity is expressed early in osteogenic lineage and in embryonic stem cells. However, alone it is not sufficient to designate cells as mature osteoblasts. Mineralization labels are often used, including alizarin complexone (red), calcein (green), or demeclocycline (yellow).

Document 3 (Title: Physiology, Bone Remodeling -- Related Testing -- Serum Markers of Bone Formation): Evidence of bone formation is indicated by the presence of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), bone alkaline phosphatase (B-ALP), osteocalcin (OC), and C- and N-terminal propeptide of type 1 procollagen (PICP and PINP). ALP is specific for bone formation, but only if the patient has no bile duct or liver disease. B-ALP is a specific product from osteoblast cells. OC is another specific osteoblast product, and there can be several active types. PICP and PINP are products of proliferating fibroblasts and osteoblasts.
