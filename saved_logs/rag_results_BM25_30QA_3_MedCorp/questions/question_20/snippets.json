        "content": "With the use of MRI imaging, genomic analysis, validated prostatic nomograms, and all of the other pre-biopsy predictive tests, it is feasible to consider initiating some\u00a0degree of\u00a0prostate cancer treatment in selected cases even without absolute histological confirmation of malignancy if the likelihood of cancer is sufficiently high. Such cases are likely to be infrequent, and patients must be thoroughly informed about the standard of care\u00a0and the potential risks and benefits of treatment without absolute confirmation of an aggressive prostatic malignancy.

[218] The test is most useful in facilitating decision-making for individuals with localized disease and low- or intermediate-risk cancers (both favorable and unfavorable) who are considering active surveillance versus definitive treatment. Prolaris\u00a0can identify cancer-specific mortality for men on active surveillance and with biochemical recurrence for those who have had radiation therapy or undergone TURP surgery.
