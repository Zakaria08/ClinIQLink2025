        "content": "The synergism of the compounds Nd-(4-methoxy-1,2,5-thiadiazol-3-yl)-sulfanilamide (sulfametrole; SOL) and 2,4-diamino-5-(3',4',5'-trimethoxy-benzyl)-pyrimidine (trimethoprim; TMP) contained in the preparation Lidaprim was proved in vitro in the agar dilution test, the disc agar diffusion method as well as a crossover test against various grampositive and gramnegative bacteria. Sulfametrole enhanced the activity of trimethoprim or its activity was intensified by trimethoprim, respectively. The increase in efficiency depends on the primary sensitivity or resistance of the bacteria against trimethoprim and/or the sulfonamide. The combination of trimethoprim + sulfametrole (1 + 20) had the same antibacterial activity as the combination co-trimoxazole = trimethoprim + Nd-(5-methyl-3-isoxazolyl)-sulfanilamide (sulfamethoxazole; SMZ). The bactericidal efficiency was shown against a strain of E. coli. Using the combination experimental development of resistance against various bacteria could not be obtained (10 times repeated contact with subbacteriostatic concentrations). Chemotherapeutical experiments in the mouse have confirmed the enhancement indicated in vitro of the combination trimethoprim-sulfonamide, irrespective of the sulfonamides chosen. Determinations of the intestinal flora before, during and after oral administration of 2 X 2 tablets SOL-TMP (Lidaprim) over a period of 10 days showed that the absolute number of bacteria in samples of faeces had not been reduced. Enterobacteria and anaerobic lactobacilli (L. bifidus), which could not be identified during the period of administration, reappeared after the end of therapy.",

        "content": "Additionally, folinic acid is sometimes used to reduce the side effects of methotrexate in rheumatoid arthritis patients. This includes reductions in nausea, abdominal pain, abnormal liver blood tests, and mouth sores. Folinic acid is also used in combination with the chemotherapy agent 5-fluorouracil in treating colon cancer. In this case, folinic acid is not used for \"rescue\" purposes; rather, it enhances the effect of 5-fluorouracil by inhibiting thymidylate synthase. Folinic acid is also sometimes used to prevent toxic effects of high doses of antimicrobial dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors such as trimethoprim and pyrimethamine. It may be prescribed in the treatment of toxoplasmosis retinitis, in combination with the folic acid antagonists pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine. Folinic acid is also used in the treatment of cerebral folate deficiency, a syndrome in which the use of folic acid cannot normalize cerebrospinal fluid levels of 5-MTHF.",
