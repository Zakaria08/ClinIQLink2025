        "content": "APPROACH TO THE PATIENT: There are four principal causes of a high-AG acidosis: (1) lactic acidosis, (2) ketoacidosis, (3) ingested toxins, and (4) acute and chronic renal failure (Table 66-4). Initial screening to differentiate the high-AG acidoses should include (1) a probe of the history for evidence of drug and toxin ingestion and measurement of arterial blood gas to detect coexistent respiratory alkalosis (salicylates); (2) determination of whether diabetes mellitus is present (diabetic ketoacidosis); (3) a search for evidence of alcoholism or increased levels of \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate (alcoholic ketoacidosis); (4) observation for clinical signs of uremia and determination of the blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (uremic acidosis); (5) inspection of the urine for oxalate crystals (ethylene glycol); and (6) recognition of the numerous clinical settings in which lactate levels may be increased (hypotension, shock, cardiac failure, leukemia, cancer, and drug or toxin ingestion).",

        "title": "[Acute poisoning with ethylene glycol esters].",
        "content": "The study was performed of 13 acute oral poisonings with ethylene glycol ethers characterized as moderate or severe and resulting in poor outcome in 3 cases. Ethyl ether was responsible for 3 poisonings, methyl ether for 10 ones. It was found, that the intoxication had four stages or periods (initial, latent, clinical, recovery) and presented with CNS impairment, gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal disorders, decompensated metabolic acidosis, etc. The paper describes two clinical cases and experimental toxicity of cellosolves as well as the effect of the inhibitor of isovaleric acid amide alcohol dehydrogenase on animal lethality. The results obtained support the suggestion of ADH-participated metabolic activation of cellosolves in the body. The prospects of further studies into intoxication pathogenesis and new opportunities for relevant poisoning management are outlined.",
