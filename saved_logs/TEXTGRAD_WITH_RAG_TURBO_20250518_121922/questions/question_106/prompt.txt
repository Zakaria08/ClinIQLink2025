With your own knowledge and the help of the following document:

Document 1 (Title: [Acute poisoning with ethylene glycol esters].): The study was performed of 13 acute oral poisonings with ethylene glycol ethers characterized as moderate or severe and resulting in poor outcome in 3 cases. Ethyl ether was responsible for 3 poisonings, methyl ether for 10 ones. It was found, that the intoxication had four stages or periods (initial, latent, clinical, recovery) and presented with CNS impairment, gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal disorders, decompensated metabolic acidosis, etc. The paper describes two clinical cases and experimental toxicity of cellosolves as well as the effect of the inhibitor of isovaleric acid amide alcohol dehydrogenase on animal lethality. The results obtained support the suggestion of ADH-participated metabolic activation of cellosolves in the body. The prospects of further studies into intoxication pathogenesis and new opportunities for relevant poisoning management are outlined.
Document 2 (Title: Jet fuel): from acute, subchronic, or chronic exposure of humans or animals to kerosene-based hydrocarbon fuels, or the constituent chemicals of these fuels, or to fuel combustion products. The effects studied include: cancer, skin conditions, respiratory disorders, immune and hematological disorders, neurological effects, visual and hearing disorders, renal and hepatic diseases, cardiovascular conditions, gastrointestinal disorders, genotoxic and metabolic effects.
Document 3 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): Three stages of ethylene glycol overdose occur. Within the first few hours after ingestion, there is transient excitation followed by CNS depression. After a delay of 4–12 hours, severe metabolic acidosis develops from accumulation of acid metabolites and lactate. Finally, deposition of oxalate crystals in renal tubules occurs, followed by delayed renal insufficiency. The key to the diagnosis of ethylene glycol poisoning is recognition of anion gap acidosis, osmolar gap, and oxalate crystals in the urine in a patient without visual symptoms.
Document 4 (Title: Ethylene Glycol Toxicity -- Epidemiology): Individuals at risk include toddlers and young children exploring their environment, patients with alcohol use disorder, and individuals wanting to end their lives. [1] According to the Annual Report of the American Association of Poison Control Centers' National Poison Data System, the number of case mentions of ethylene glycol in 2016 was 6,374. Most of these cases were intentional in adults older than 20. [4] Children younger than 12 comprised 686 of the 6374 cases, with 13 unknown child-age cases. [4]
Document 5 (Title: Physiology, Acid Base Balance -- Pathophysiology -- Increased Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis): The mnemonic MUDPILES has classically been used to teach students the causes of high anion gap metabolic acidosis. MUDPILES stands for methanol, uremia, diabetic ketoacidosis, paraldehyde, infection, lactic acidosis, ethylene glycol, and salicylates. A new mnemonic, GOLDMARK, has been suggested to be an improvement. GOLDMARK is an anagram for glycols (ethylene and propylene), oxoproline, lactate, methanol, aspirin, renal failure, and ketones. If a patient has an anion gap over 12, these mnemonics are helpful to remember the possible causes of the disorder. [7] [8]
