Document 1 (Title: Peripheral Hypertrophic Subepithelial Corneal Degeneration -- Evaluation -- Clinical Examination): Manifest refraction: The first step in evaluating PHSCD is manifest refraction to quantify the patient's refractive error and cylindrical astigmatism. Manifest refraction may show a cylindrical astigmatism of 2.0 diopters or more. Slit-lamp examination:  Slit-lamp biomicroscopy should be used to assess the clinical signs of PHSCD and rule out other diagnoses. Findings may include peripheral and circumferential subepithelial fibrosis in both eyes, associated neovascularization or pannus, and linear iron deposits along the central edge of the areas of opacification. [2] Visual acuity test: This test helps determine the extent of visual impairment caused by the corneal changes. Specular microscopy: This technique evaluates the health of the corneal endothelium, which can be affected by chronic corneal conditions such as PHSCD.
Document 2 (Title: Bile duct disease: prospective comparison of ERCP, CT, and fat suppression MRI.): The authors compared computed tomography (CT) and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), techniques commonly used to study the biliary tree, with pre- and post-Gd-DTPA breath-hold fast low angle shot (FLASH) and fat suppressed spin-echo in 28 consecutive patients with bile duct abnormalities detected on ERCP, including 11 patients with malignant disease and 17 patients with benign disease. ERCP, CT, and magnetic resonance (MR) images were prospectively interpreted in a blinded fashion and reviewed by consensus. ERCP characterized all cases of malignant disease by the presence of a narrowed bile duct lumen with irregular margins. CT and MRI detected all cases of malignant disease and characterized nine of 11 as malignant. In seven of these cases, CT and MRI showed thickening of extrahepatic bile duct walls greater than 5 mm. MRI images showed intrahepatic-enhancing periportal tissue in four cases, which was not seen on CT images, and which was biopsy-proven tumor extension. Benign disease was characterized on ERCP images by the demonstration of smooth tapered narrowings in 16 cases, whereas on CT and MR images it was characterized by mild to moderate dilatation of the intrahepatic bile ducts and wall thickness less than 5 mm in 13 cases. Overall ERCP correctly characterized 27 cases as benign or malignant and CT and MRI both characterized 25. The results of this study show a trend that ERCP is superior to CT and MRI for characterizing bile duct disease.
Document 3 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Diagnosis The definitive diagnosis of PSC requires cholangiographic imaging. Over the last several years, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) has been used as the imaging technique of choice for initial evaluation. Once patients are screened in this manner, some investigators feel that endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) should also be performed to be certain whether or not a dominant stricture is present. Typical cholangiographic findings in PSC are multifocal stricturing and beading involving both the intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary tree. However, although involvement may be of 2062 the intrahepatic bile ducts alone or of the extrahepatic bile ducts alone, more commonly, both are involved. These strictures are typically short and with intervening segments of normal or slightly dilated bile ducts that are distributed diffusely, producing the classic beaded appearance. The gallbladder and cystic duct can be
