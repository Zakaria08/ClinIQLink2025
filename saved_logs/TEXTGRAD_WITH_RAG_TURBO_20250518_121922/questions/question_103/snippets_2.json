        "content": "Unsaturated fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation: The oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids generates intermediates that cannot serve as substrates for 2,3-enoyl CoA hydratase (see Fig. 16.17). Consequently, additional enzymes are required. Oxidation of a double bond at an odd-numbered carbon, such as 18:1(9) (oleic acid), requires one additional enzyme, 3,2-enoyl CoA isomerase, which converts the 3-cis derivative obtained after three rounds of \u03b2-oxidation to the 2-trans derivative required by the hydratase. Oxidation of a double bond at an even-numbered carbon, such as 18:2(9,12) (linoleic acid), requires an NADPH-dependent 2,4-dienoyl CoA reductase in addition to the isomerase. [Note: Because unsaturated fatty acids are less reduced than saturated fatty acids, fewer reducing equivalents are produced by their oxidation.] 8.",

        "content": "The molecule's chemical structure was determined by Williams in 1940. Elvehjem et al and Jukes et al demonstrated that pantothenic acid was a growth and \"anti-dermatitis\" factor for chickens. In the 1950s, one of the functional forms of pantothenic acid, coenzyme A (CoA), was discovered as the cofactor essential for the acetylation of sulfonamides and choline. In the mid-1960s, pantothenic acid was identified as a component of an acyl carrier protein (ACP) in the fatty acid synthesis complex. Fritz Albert Lipmann won the Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine \"for his discovery of coenzyme A and its importance for intermediary metabolism.\" [2] All genomes sequenced to date encode enzymes that use coenzyme A as a substrate, the biosynthesis of which requires cysteine, pantothenate (vitamin B5), and adenosine triphosphate (ATP).

        "title": "The microbial degradation of cyclohexanecarboxylic acid by a beta-oxidation pathway with simultaneous induction to the utilization of benzoate.",
        "content": "The metabolism of cyclohexanecarboxylic acid by a bacterium, designated PRL W19, follows a pathway involving beta-oxidation of coenzyme A intermediates analogous to the classical oxidation of fatty acids. The organism appears to have the property for the constitutive metabolism of caproic acid, and cell extracts contain high levels of the enzymes required for the functioning of the fatty acid cycle. However, the metabolism of cyclohexanecarboxylic acid requires induction by growth or incubation with an appropriate substrate. Extracts of induced cells contain several enzyme activities which are synthesized in response to the induction process. These enzymes include cyclohexanecarboxyl-CoA synthetase, cyclohexanecarboxyl-CoA dehydrogenase, 1-cyclohexenecarboxyl-CoA hydratase, and trans-2-hydroxycyclohexanecarboxyl-CoA dehydrogenase. A characteristics feature of this organism is that it becomes induced for the metabolism of benzoate and catechol during growth on cyclohexanecarboxylic acid, but benzoate does not appear to be an obligatory intermediate in the metabolism of cyclohexanecarboxylic acid.",
