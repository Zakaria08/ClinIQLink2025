== Original Prompt ==
Question: Among the following statements, which one(s) is (are) correct? The catabolism of saturated fatty acids:
Options:
1. Occurs in the cytoplasm
2. Is accompanied by ATP biosynthesis
3. Requires NADP-dependent dehydrogenase
4. Requires substrates activated by coenzyme A
5. Gives rise to alpha-beta unsaturated metabolites of the trans form

Respond strictly in valid JSON format as shown below:
{"answer": ["1", "3"]} ← if options 1 and 3 are correct
Only output the JSON object. Do not include explanations, labels, markdown, or any other text.

== Full Prompt ==
Explain the steps involved in the catabolism of saturated fatty acids, highlighting key enzymes and pathways.

Options:
1. Occurs in the cytoplasm
2. Is accompanied by ATP biosynthesis
3. Requires NADP-dependent dehydrogenase
4. Requires substrates activated by coenzyme A
5. Gives rise to alpha-beta unsaturated metabolites of the trans form

== Answer ==
{"answer": ["1", "4"]}

== Feedback ==
Incorrect answer: The answer incorrectly includes option "1" and omits "2" and "4"; the prompt should specify that catabolism occurs in the mitochondria and involves ATP synthesis and coenzyme A activation.

== Improved Full Prompt ==
Describe the process of saturated fatty acid catabolism, focusing on the key enzymes and metabolic pathways involved. Include the sequence of reactions and any regulatory mechanisms.
