== Original Prompt ==
Question: Among the following statements, which one(s) is (are) correct? The catabolism of saturated fatty acids:
Options:
1. Occurs in the cytoplasm
2. Is accompanied by ATP biosynthesis
3. Requires NADP-dependent dehydrogenase
4. Requires substrates activated by coenzyme A
5. Gives rise to alpha-beta unsaturated metabolites of the trans form

Respond strictly in valid JSON format as shown below:
{"answer": ["1", "3"]} ← if options 1 and 3 are correct
Only output the JSON object. Do not include explanations, labels, markdown, or any other text.

== Answer ==
{
    "answer": ["1", "4"]
}

== Feedback ==
Incorrect answer: The answer incorrectly includes option "1" and omits correct options "2" and "4"; the prompt should clarify that catabolism of saturated fatty acids occurs in the mitochondria, not the cytoplasm, and involves ATP biosynthesis and coenzyme A activation.

== Improved Full Prompt ==
Which of the following statements accurately describe the process of saturated fatty acid catabolism?
