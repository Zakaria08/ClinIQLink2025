        "content": "A 25 year-old primigravid woman developed chronic falciparum malaria at 23 weeks' gestation. Diagnosis was suspected on splenomegaly and haemolytic anaemia but without fever and confirmed by thin smears (Plasmodium falciparum) and serologic tests. She was successfully cured with chloroquine therapy. One week after her return from Cameroon, a 28 year-old woman was seen for malaria at 32 weeks' gestation. In spite of chloroquine therapy, foetal troubles appeared and a caesarean was performed. The newborn had an APGAR coefficient of 3 points and examination both of his blood films and the placenta revealed numerous trophozoites of P. falciparum. Chloroquine resulted in a rapid cure of the child. In endemic areas, parasitaemia is more frequent and dense during pregnancy, and especially in primigravidae. However, clinical symptoms remain rare because of acquired immunity. In case of no or loss of immunity, malarial infections are heavy and abortions are frequent. Congenital malaria is probably due to transplacental transfer of infected red blood cells of the mother. In endemic areas, the incidence is low due to the simultaneously transferred immunity. Emergency treatment is necessary because of life-threatening to both mother and child.",

        "content": "Risk Pregnant women with GP should be monitored for conditions that may affect the fetus, including, but not limited to, low or decreasing volume of amniotic fluid, preterm labor, and intrauterine growth retardation. Onset of GP in the first or second trimester and presence of blisters may lead to adverse pregnancy outcomes including decreased gestational age at delivery, preterm birth, and low birth weight children. Such pregnancies should be considered high risk and appropriate obstetric care should be provided. Systemic corticosteroid treatment, in contrast, does not substantially affect pregnancy outcomes, and its use for GP in pregnant women is justified. GP typically reoccurs in subsequent pregnancies. Passive transfer of the mother\u2019s antibodies to the fetus causes some (about 10%) newborns to develop mild skin lesions, but these typically will resolve within weeks of parturition. Diagnosis",

        "content": "The first fetal movements, which are felt by the mother, are called quickening. One function of these movements is to alert the\u00a0pregnant woman that she has a fetus growing in her uterus. Quickening often occurs between the 16th to the 22nd week of pregnancy.\u00a0This\u00a0is called a presumptive sign of pregnancy as the other movements of the woman's body can mimic early fetal movements\u00a0such as flatus, peristalsis, and abdominal muscle contractions. A multiparous woman will usually first notice these fluttering movements of the fetus at an earlier gestation than a primiparous woman. A multiparous woman might feel movements as early as 16 weeks, whereas a primiparous woman may not feel anything until 20 to 22 weeks. At around 20 weeks of gestation, the trained healthcare provider can feel fetal movement externally through the abdomen. This is considered a positive sign of pregnancy. [3]",
