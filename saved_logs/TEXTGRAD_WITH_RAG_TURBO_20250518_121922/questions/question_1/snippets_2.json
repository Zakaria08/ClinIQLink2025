        "content": "Asymptomatic infection with Chlamydia trachomatis is very common, whereas the consequences of undiagnosed or untreated infection can be far-reaching. It is for these reasons that screening is recommended. All pregnant women are recommended to be screened for C. trachomatis . All sexually active females younger than 25 should be screened annually. Women older than 25 should be screened if they have risk factors for sexually transmitted infections. Risk factors include sexual partners with multiple concurrent partners, new or multiple sexual partners, inconsistent use of condoms if the relationship is not monogamous, exchanging sex for money or drugs, or previous/coexisting STI. Men who have sex with men should also be screened for chlamydial infection. In individuals with HIV, screening should be done at the initial presentation and annually. For individuals entering a correctional facility, it is recommended to screen for chlamydia in women 35 years old or younger and men thirty years old or younger.",

        "title": "[Perception of common symptomatology during pregnancy, puerperium and lactation].",
        "content": "The objective of this investigation was to identify women's perception on normal and abnormal symptoms of pregnancy, puerperium and breastfeeding; its purpose was to assess the varying educational needs in the geographical area where a reproductive health education program will be implemented. 405 fertile females living in non-residential areas were interviewed in their homes. A predominantly pre-coded questionnaire was used; items related to reproductive health, preventable and susceptible to education were included. Symptomatology perceived incorrectly as normal: a) In pregnancy: Dysuria: 24 percent, genital hemorrhage: 15 per cent, absence of fetal movement: 23 per cent, did not know how to recognize preterm birth symptoms: 70 per cent. b) In puerperium: Increased quantity in lochia rubra: 17 per cent, fever: 22 per cent, fetid lochia: 28 per cent, and c) In breastfeeding: Breasts red and warm: 48 per cent, fever: 30 per cent, nipple fissures: 70 per cent. Symptomatology perceived incorrectly as abnormal: a) In pregnancy: Frequent urination: 17 per cent, morning nausea in the 1st trimester: 9 per cent, emotional instability: 21 per cent, Braxton Hicks contractions: 41 per cent, and b) Postpartum period: Decreased quantity in lochia rubra: 9 per cent, non-fetid lochia alba: 43 per cent, calostrum: 20 per cent. The assessment educational needs showed an inaccurate identification of abnormal and normal obstetric events; its frequency varied. It is essential that a pregnant woman be well informed and educated in order to preserve her own health as well as that of her unborn child. She must be able to recognize warning signs, take action and demand appropriate medical care. Health care personnel and health educators must be responsible for the promoting of maternal and child health during pregnancy.",

        "content": "Clinical practice Assessment The psychiatric assessment of a child or adolescent starts with obtaining a psychiatric history by interviewing the young person and his/her parents or caregivers. The assessment includes a detailed exploration of the current concerns about the child's emotional or behavioral problems, the child's physical health and development, history of parental care (including possible abuse and neglect), family relationships and history of parental mental illness. It is regarded as desirable to obtain information from multiple sources (for example both parents, or a parent and a grandparent) as informants may give widely differing accounts of the child's problems. Collateral information is usually obtained from the child's school with regards to academic performance, peer relationships, and behavior in the school environment.",
