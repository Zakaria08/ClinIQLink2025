        "content": "A case of miliary tuberculosis associated with acute respiratory failure during pregnancy was reported. A 39-year-old, 29-week pregnant woman was admitted to our hospital with complaints of nonproductive cough and fever on June 12. On admission, her temperature was 38.2 degrees C; pulse rate was 90/min., and blood pressure was 120/76 mmHg. Physical examination revealed moist rales at right lung basis. Chest X-ray showed small nodular infiltrates in right lower lung field. Laboratory data revealed positive CRP, accelerated ESR and increased level of alpha 2-globulin. The number of T-cells was markedly decreased (14/mm3). The PPD skin test was negative, and the sputum smears for acid-fast bacilli were negative. Suspected of bacterial or viral pneumonia, the patient was treated with antibiotics (CPM, EM and CAZ), which had no effects for her. On June 16, the Chest X-ray showed infiltrates throughout bilateral lung fields, and the patient became increasingly dyspneic. On June 18, the results of arterial blood gas, analysis under room air were: PaO2 26.7 Torr, PaCO2 29.0 Torr, pH 7.505. Because of severe hypoxemia, she was intubated and placed on a volume-cycled respirator. Hydrocortisone (1000 mg, daily) was added to treatment because ARDS was suspected. Since the smears of tracheobronchial secretions showed acid-fast bacilli on June 24, she was diagnosed to have miliary tuberculosis. Then the intensive therapy with antituberculosis drugs (isoniazid 400 mg, rifampicin 450 mg, and streptomycin 1g, daily) was started. The non specific antibiotics were discontinued; hydrocortisone was tapered and stopped. The next week, she became afebrile and hypoxemia steadily improved.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

The blood test indicated abnormal liver function and subsequent blood tests diagnosed hepatitis C. Roddick explained that she had a large blood transfusion in 1971, after the birth of her younger daughter, and that she was convinced that the transfusion had infected her with hepatitis C. This was about twenty years before blood donors in the United Kingdom were screened for hepatitis C. She reported that she had developed cirrhosis of the liver, and that her main symptoms were itching and poor concentration. She briefly mentioned that medical treatment with interferon did not suit her. Roddick explained that she kept fit and active, and that she attended biannual out-patient hospital appointments in Southampton, as well as being under review by the liver transplant team at the Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.",
