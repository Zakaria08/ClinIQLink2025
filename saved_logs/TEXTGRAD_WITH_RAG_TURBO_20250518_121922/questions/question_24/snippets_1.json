        "content": "80 patients (P) (68 men and twelve women) with the diagnosis of delirium tremens were retrospectively analyzed and reexamined over a period of ten years (1974 to 1984). Included were only patients who--after failure of oral medication--required intravenous therapy with Chlomethiazol and thereby intensive care treatment. Mean age was 46.2 (26 to 75) years. During the observation period delirium tremens increased in frequency by 11% each year. Nine patients had two, six patients three and two patients four episodes of delirium tremens. In 86.7% delirium tremens occurred with fatty liver and alcoholic hepatitis, epileptic seizures, cirrhosis and hepatic coma, gastrointestinal hemorrhage and pancreatitis. Eight patients (10%) died in hospital at a mean age of 53.2 years. None of the deceased had less than three (on average four) complicating or associated diseases. These were mostly pneumonia, cirrhosis, hepatic coma, and gastrointestinal hemorrhage. The mean duration of intravenous Chlomethiazol therapy was 4.7 (0.25 to 20) days, the applied dose 26.2 (0.8 to 78.6) grams, there being no significant difference between survivors and non-survivors. Of the 72 survivors 62 were invited for follow-up examination after an average of five years. During this period another twelve patients (15%) died of pneumonia, gastrointestinal bleeding, cardiocirculatory failure and accidents. Life expectancy was only 9.3 years. Of 29 patients who came for follow-up, 55% showed clinical evidence of alcohol dependency, 65% had elevated gamma-glutamyl-transferase.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

She was diag-nosed with Crohn\u2019s disease 2 years ago, and it involves her terminal ileum and proximal colon, as confirmed by colonoscopy and small bowel radiography. She was initially treated with mesalamine and budesonide with good response, but over the last 2 months, she has had a relapse of her symptoms. She is experiencing fatigue, cramping, abdominal pains, and nonbloody diarrhea up to 10 times daily, and she has had a 15-lb weight loss. She has no other significant medical or surgical his-tory. Her current medications are mesalamine 2.4 g/d and budesonide 9 mg/d. She appears thin and tired. Abdominal examination reveals tenderness without guarding in the right lower quadrant; no masses are palpable. On perianal examination, there is no tenderness, fissure, or fistula. Her laboratory data are notable for anemia and elevated C-reactive protein. What are the options for immediate",

        "content": "Prognosis Acute hepatitis Nearly all patients with hepatitis A infections recover completely without complications if they were healthy prior to the infection. Similarly, acute hepatitis B infections have a favorable course towards complete recovery in 95\u201399% of patients. However, certain factors may portend a poorer outcome, such as co-morbid medical conditions or initial presenting symptoms of ascites, edema, or encephalopathy. Overall, the mortality rate for acute hepatitis is low: ~0.1% in total for cases of hepatitis A and B, but rates can be higher in certain populations (super infection with both hepatitis B and D, pregnant women, etc.). In contrast to hepatitis A & B, hepatitis C carries a much higher risk of progressing to chronic hepatitis, approaching 85\u201390%. Cirrhosis has been reported to develop in 20\u201350% of patients with chronic hepatitis C. Other rare complications of acute hepatitis include pancreatitis, aplastic anemia, peripheral neuropathy, and myocarditis.",
