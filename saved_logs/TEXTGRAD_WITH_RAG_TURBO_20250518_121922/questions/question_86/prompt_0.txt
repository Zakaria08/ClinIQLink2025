Document 1 (Title: Keratoconjunctivitis -- Deterrence and Patient Education): Allergen management: For allergic keratoconjunctivitis, allergen-proof bedding, regular air filter cleaning, and limiting outdoor exposure during high pollen seasons should be suggested. The potential benefits of allergen immunotherapy may also be discussed in collaboration with an allergist. [156]

Document 3 (Title: Aerobiology): Aerobiology (from Greek ἀήρ, aēr, "air"; βίος, bios, "life"; and -λογία, -logia) is a branch of biology that studies organic particles, such as bacteria, fungal spores, very small insects, pollen grains and viruses, which are passively transported by the air. Aerobiologists have traditionally been involved in the measurement and reporting of airborne pollen and fungal spores as a service to allergy sufferers. The first finding of airborne algae took place in Germany in 1910.
