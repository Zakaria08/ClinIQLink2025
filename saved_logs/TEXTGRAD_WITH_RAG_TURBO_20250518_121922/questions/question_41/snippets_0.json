        "content": "Neisseria meningitides is the organism responsible for meningococcal meningitis and is the second most common causative organism for bacterial meningitis in the United States. [1] This bacterium is an anaerobic, bean, or kidney-shaped gram-negative diplococci. It grows in chocolate agar and blood agar at room temperature with 5%-10% atmospheric carbon dioxide. Neisseria meningitides are catalase-positive, oxidize glucose and maltose that changes pH, and helps to differentiate from gonococci, which cannot oxidize maltose. The organism grows in selective Thayer-Martin media, which contains antibiotics like vancomycin, colistin, and nystatin by preventing the growth of other gram-negative bacteria, gram-positive bacteria, and yeast. N. meningitidis colonizes mostly in the naso-and oropharynx but can colonize in other body parts like the anal mucosa, conjunctiva, and urogenital tracts. It possesses multiple virulent factors: Pilli, opacity proteins, lipo-oligosaccharides, capsular polysaccharide, and factor H binding protein. The polysaccharide capsule protects the bacterium from complement-mediated phagocytosis and lysis. [2]",

        "title": "Kinetics and site specificity of hydroperoxide-induced oxidative damage in red blood cells.",
        "content": "To provide a detailed description of the time course and the site specificity of hydroperoxide-induced oxidative stress in red blood cells (RBCs), we have characterized the action of a membrane-soluble (cumene hydroperoxide [cumOOH]) and a water-soluble (hydrogen peroxide [H2O2]) oxidant. The fluorescent polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) parinaric acid (PnA) was used to probe peroxidation processes in the membrane, and oxidation of hemoglobin (Hb) was measured spectrophotometrically as an indicator of cytosolic oxidative stress. The observed degradation patterns of PnA and Hb were clearly distinct for each oxidant. At comparable oxidant concentrations, the cumulative oxidative stress on the RBC membrane was always much higher with cumOOH, whereas much more Hb oxidation was measured with H2O2. The kinetics of Hb oxidation as well as the nature of the products formed were different for each oxidant. The main Hb oxidation product generated gradually by cumOOH was metHb, whereas H2O2 caused the rapid formation of ferrylHb. CumOOH caused more oxidation of endogenous PUFAs and of vitamin E, while the degradation pattern of vitamin E closely resembled that of PnA. At high oxidant concentrations, extensive cell lysis was observed after prolonged incubation. Butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) completely prevented oxidation of endogenous PUFAs but did not completely prevent hemolysis, indicating that factors other than lipid peroxidation are also important in causing lysis of RBCs. The action of cumOOH is characterized by a gradual reaction with Hb, generating radicals that produce an oxidative stress primarily directed at the membrane, which increases in time to a maximum and then gradually decreases. In contrast, H2O2 crosses the RBC membrane and reacts rapidly with Hb, generating a very reactive radical species that has Hb, not the membrane, as a prime target. H2O2-induced oxidative stress is at a maximum immediately after addition of this oxidant and decreases rapidly to zero in a short time. These findings provide further insight into the mode of action of hydroperoxides and the mechanism of compartmentalization of RBC oxidative damage.",

        "title": "Streptococcus",
        "content": "Beta-hemolysis (\u03b2-hemolysis), sometimes called complete hemolysis, is a complete lysis of red cells in the media around and under the colonies: the area appears lightened (yellow) and transparent. Streptolysin, an exotoxin, is the enzyme produced by the bacteria which causes the complete lysis of red blood cells. There are two types of streptolysin: Streptolysin O (SLO) and streptolysin S (SLS). Streptolysin O is an oxygen-sensitive cytotoxin, secreted by most group A Streptococcus (GAS), and interacts with cholesterol in the membrane of eukaryotic cells (mainly red and white blood cells, macrophages, and platelets), and usually results in beta-hemolysis under the surface of blood agar. Streptolysin S is an oxygen-stable cytotoxin also produced by most GAS strains which results in clearing on the surface of blood agar. SLS affects immune cells, including polymorphonuclear leukocytes and lymphocytes, and is thought to prevent the host immune system from clearing infection.",
