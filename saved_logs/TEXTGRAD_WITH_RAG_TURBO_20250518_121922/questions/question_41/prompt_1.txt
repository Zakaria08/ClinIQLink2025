Document 1 (Title: Hemolysis (microbiology)): Hemolysis (from Greek αιμόλυση, meaning 'blood breakdown') is the breakdown of red blood cells. The ability of bacterial colonies to induce hemolysis when grown on blood agar is used to classify certain microorganisms. This is particularly useful in classifying streptococcal species. A substance that causes hemolysis is a hemolysin. Types Alpha-hemolysis When alpha-hemolysis (α-hemolysis) is present, the agar under the colony is dark and greenish. Streptococcus pneumoniae and a group of oral streptococci (Streptococcus viridans or viridans streptococci) display alpha hemolysis. This is sometimes called green hemolysis because of the color change in the agar. Other synonymous terms are incomplete hemolysis and partial hemolysis. Alpha hemolysis is caused by hydrogen peroxide produced by the bacterium, oxidizing hemoglobin producing the green oxidized derivative methemoglobin.
Document 2 (Title: Meningococcal Meningitis -- Etiology): Neisseria meningitides is the organism responsible for meningococcal meningitis and is the second most common causative organism for bacterial meningitis in the United States. [1] This bacterium is an anaerobic, bean, or kidney-shaped gram-negative diplococci. It grows in chocolate agar and blood agar at room temperature with 5%-10% atmospheric carbon dioxide. Neisseria meningitides are catalase-positive, oxidize glucose and maltose that changes pH, and helps to differentiate from gonococci, which cannot oxidize maltose. The organism grows in selective Thayer-Martin media, which contains antibiotics like vancomycin, colistin, and nystatin by preventing the growth of other gram-negative bacteria, gram-positive bacteria, and yeast. N. meningitidis colonizes mostly in the naso-and oropharynx but can colonize in other body parts like the anal mucosa, conjunctiva, and urogenital tracts. It possesses multiple virulent factors: Pilli, opacity proteins, lipo-oligosaccharides, capsular polysaccharide, and factor H binding protein. The polysaccharide capsule protects the bacterium from complement-mediated phagocytosis and lysis. [2]
Document 3 (Title: Cell_Biology_Alberts): The structure of the protein coat, or capsid, of poliovirus. This virus was once a common cause of paralysis, but the disease (poliomyelitis) has been greatly reduced by widespread vaccination. The bacterium Vibrio cholerae, the causative agent of the epidemic, diarrheal disease cholera. (C) The protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei (purple) in a field of erythrocytes (red blood cells; pink). This parasite causes African sleeping sickness, a potentially fatal disease of the central nervous system. (D) This clump of Ascaris nematodes was removed from the obstructed intestine of a two-year-old boy. (A, courtesy of Robert Grant, Stephan Crainic, and James M.

Provide a detailed case study of a 43-year-old woman who presents at the emergency department with specific symptoms, and analyze the infectious agent responsible for her condition.

Options:
A. A bacterium that induces partial lysis of red cells with hydrogen peroxide
B. A bacterium that induces complete lysis of the red cells of a blood agar plate with an oxygen-sensitive cytotoxin
C. A bacterium that induces heme degradation of the red cells of a blood agar plate
D. A bacterium that requires an anaerobic environment to grow properly
