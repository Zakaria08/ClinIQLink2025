Document 1 (Title: Primary standard): Arsenic trioxide for making sodium arsenite solution for standardisation of sodium periodate solution (until Ph. Eur. 3, Appendix 2001 also for iodine and cerium(IV) sulfate solutions, since Ph. Eur. 4, 2002 standardised by sodium thiosulfate) Benzoic acid for standardisation of waterless basic solutions: ethanolic sodium and potassium hydroxide, TBAH, and alkali methanolates in methanol, isopropanol, or DMF Potassium bromate (KBrO3) for standardisation of sodium thiosulfate solutions Potassium hydrogen phthalate (usually called KHP) for standardisation of aqueous base and perchloric acid in acetic acid solutions Sodium carbonate for standardisation of aqueous acids: hydrochloric, sulfuric acid and nitric acid solutions (but not acetic acid) Sodium chloride for standardisation of silver nitrate solutions Sulfanilic acid for standardisation of sodium nitrite solutions Zinc powder, after being dissolved in sulfuric or hydrochloric acid, for standardization of EDTA solutions
Document 2 (Title: Histology, Periosteum And Endosteum -- Histochemistry and Cytochemistry): Use alkaline alcohol (90 ml 80% ethanol mixed with 10mls 25% ammonia) to wash the section then rinse with tap water. Wash with distilled water Stain with Weigert s Haematoxylin for 10 minutes Wash with distilled water Wash with 1% acetic acid for 20 to 30 seconds Stain with reagent 1, e.g., stain with Ponceau-Fuchsin final solution 5 minutes Wash with 1% acetic acid for 20 to 30 seconds Stain with reagent 2, e.g., phosphomolybdic acid-orange G solution for 5 minutes Wash with 1% acetic acid for 20 to 30 seconds Stain with Reagent 3 e.g., light green for 5 minutes Wash with 1% acetic acid for 20 to 30 seconds Wash with distilled water Mount with non-aqueous mounting media Mineralized bone looks green, osteoid looks orange or red, nuclei look blue-grey, and cartilage looks purple.

Document 3 (Title: Cell_Biology_Alberts): Because an OH– ion combines with a H3O+ ion to form two water molecules, an increase in the OH– concentration forces a decrease in the concentration of H3O+, and vice versa. A pure solution of water contains an equal concentration (10–7 M) of both ions, rendering it neutral. The interior of a cell is also kept close to neutrality by the presence of buffers: weak acids and bases that can release or take up protons near pH 7, keeping the environment of the cell relatively constant under a variety of conditions. Figure 2–5 Protons readily move in aqueous solutions. (a) The reaction that takes place when a molecule of acetic acid dissolves in water. at ph 7, nearly all of the acetic acid is present as acetate ion. (B) Water molecules are continuously exchanging protons with each other to form hydronium and hydroxyl ions. These ions in turn rapidly recombine to form water molecules. a Cell is formed from Carbon Compounds
