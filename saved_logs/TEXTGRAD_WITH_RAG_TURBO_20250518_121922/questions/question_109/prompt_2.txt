Document 1 (Title: Antianginal): An antianginal is a drug used in the treatment of angina pectoris, a symptom of ischaemic heart disease. Examples Drugs used are nitrates, beta blockers, or calcium channel blockers. Nitrates Nitrates cause vasodilation of the venous capacitance vessels by stimulating the endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF). Used to relieve both exertional and vasospastic angina by allowing venous pooling, reducing the pressure in the ventricles and so reducing wall tension and oxygen requirements in, the heart. Short-acting nitrates are used to abort angina attacks that have occurred, while longer-acting nitrates are used in the prophylactic management of the condition. Agents include glyceryl trinitrate (GTN), pentaerythritol tetranitrate, isosorbide dinitrate and isosorbide mononitrate. Beta blockers Beta blockers are used in the prophylaxis of exertional angina by reducing the myocardial oxygen demand below the level that would provoke an angina attack.
Document 2 (Title: Isosorbide -- Indications -- FDA Approved Indications for Isosorbide Dinitrate): Prevention or treatment of angina pectoris resulting from coronary artery disease - however, it is not recommended for use once the anginal episode has started because the onset of action is not sufficiently rapid enough to abort an acute anginal event. In the latter case, glyceryl trinitrate is preferable. Treatment of congestive heart failure. A fixed-dose combination of isosorbide dinitrate and hydralazine is approved to treat congestive heart failure in African Americans. [2]
Document 3 (Title: Antianginal and anti-ischemic efficacy of nicorandil compared with nifedipine in patients with angina pectoris and coronary heart disease: a double-blind, randomized, multicenter study.): Patients with stable, effort-induced angina pectoris and a typical combination of anginal pain and ischemic ST depression in exercise tolerance tests were randomized to treatment for 8 weeks with nicorandil (a newly developed antianginal and anti-ischemic drug) or nifedipine. After 4 weeks, the dosage of nicorandil was increased from 10 mg b.i.d. to 20 mg b.i.d., but the recommended dosage of nifedipine, 20 mg b.i.d., was kept constant during the study period. Double-blind treatment was preceded by a 2-week prephase during which patients were treated with isosorbide dinitrate. During the study period, patients were asked to report the rate of anginal attacks and consumption of sublingual nitroglycerin. Measurements of blood pressure and heart rate at rest and during exercise always were performed 2 h after drug intake. Fifty-eight patients were randomized--29 to nicorandil and 29 to nifedipine. There were large individual variations in anginal attack rates, which makes group comparisons difficult, but in the nicorandil group, the anginal attack rate decreased significantly compared with baseline frequency. Systolic blood pressure at rest was reduced significantly only with the highest dose of nicorandil, but nifedipine had a significant effect on both systolic and diastolic blood pressures as well as on the heart rate. Both treatments significantly increased exercise duration, time to onset of angina pectoris, and time to 1-mm ST depression. In the nicorandil group, an improvement was noted with the 20-mg dose compared with the 10-mg dose, but no significant differences were noted between the nicorandil and nifedipine groups after either 4 or 8 weeks of treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
