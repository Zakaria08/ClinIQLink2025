Document 1 (Title: The consumer's risk in clinical trials.): In any formal statistical test of the null hypothesis (the statement that a population parameter is equal to a specific value), there are two possible types of error. Type 1 or alpha error has occurred if the investigator rejects the null hypothesis when it is true. For example, an experimental treatment is declared an advance over standard treatment when it is not. Type 2 or beta error has occurred if the null hypothesis is not rejected when it is false. In this case, the investigator concludes that the experimental treatment is no different than the standard when it actually is. The two types of error can be conceptualized, respectively, as the consumer's risk and the producer's risk. In many reports of clinical trial methodology, it is the producer's risk that is emphasized. It is understandable why producer's risk would be of concern to authors of clinical studies. There are, however, numerous potential sources of consumer's risk. It is the latter type of risk that is the primary subject of this report.
Document 2 (Title: Power of a test): A significance criterion is a statement of how unlikely a positive result must be, if the null hypothesis of no effect is true, for the null hypothesis to be rejected. The most commonly used criteria are probabilities of 0.05 (5%, 1 in 20), 0.01 (1%, 1 in 100), and 0.001 (0.1%, 1 in 1000). If the criterion is 0.05, the probability of the data implying an effect at least as large as the observed effect when the null hypothesis is true must be less than 0.05, for the null hypothesis of no effect to be rejected. One easy way to increase the power of a test is to carry out a less conservative test by using a larger significance criterion, for example 0.10 instead of 0.05 . This increases the chance of rejecting the null hypothesis (obtaining a statistically significant result) when the null hypothesis is false; that is, it reduces the risk of a type II error (false negative regarding whether an effect exists). But it also increases the risk of obtaining a statistically significant result
Document 3 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): statistical testing requires declaration of a null hypothesis, usually corresponding to the “default” state (i.e., no difference or the patient is healthy). The alternative hypothesis would then negate the stated null hypothesis (i.e., there is a dif-ference or the patient is unhealthy). The result of a statistical significance test may either reject or accept the null hypothesis, and this result can correspond with the true state (a correct deci-sion) or not correspond with the true state (an error). Two types of error are possible (Table 51-3).Type I Error. A type I error occurs when the null hypothesis is rejected but is actually true in the population. This may also be referred to as a false positive. The type I error rate, denoted by the Greek letter α (alpha), is the probability that the null hypothesis is rejected given that it is true. The error rate may also be referred to as the significance level, and often a value of 0.05, or 5%, is frequently used in the literature.Type

Please identify the accurate statement(s) regarding the significance threshold in a statistical test:

Options:
1. Is the risk of wrongfully rejecting the null hypothesis
2. Usually has values of 0.95 or 0.99
3. Is also called risk of 2nd kind
4. Is usually noted as alpha
5. Increases if the acceptance interval of the null hypothesis is smaller
