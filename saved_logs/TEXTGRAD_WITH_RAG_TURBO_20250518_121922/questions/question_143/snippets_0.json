        "content": "Pharmaceutical glaze is used by the drug and nutritional supplement industry as a coating material for tablets and capsules. It serves to improve the product's appearance, extend shelf life and protect it from moisture, as well as provide a solid finishing film for pre-print coatings. It also serves to mask unpleasant odors and aid in the swallowing of the tablet. The shellac coating is insoluble in stomach acid and may make the tablet difficult for the body to break down or assimilate. For this reason, it can also be used as an ingredient in time-released, sustained or delayed-action pills. The product is listed on the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) inactive ingredient list.",

        "title": "[Prolongation of theophylline derivative release with cellulose acetate based tablets].",
        "content": "Sustained-release tablets were prepared with three theophylline compounds of increasing solubility: theophylline, dyphylline and proxyphylline. Cellulose acetate was used as the matrix polymer. Two formulation parameters were studied: incorporated theophylline dose and percentage of polymer constituting the matrix. Drug release was enhanced as these parameter values rose. A mixed mineral and plastic matrix was formed by the two insoluble excipients, i.e. cellulose acetate and dibasic calcium phosphate for direct compression. Drug release could be optimized either by 2(2) factorial analysis or by multiple linear regression. Drug solubility was found to have an especially important influence on the release and did not allow sustained-release tablets to be obtained when it was too great. In the case of dyphylline and proxyphylline, only the additional application of a barrier-coating over the surface of the matrix tablets enabled prevention of their premature erosion and the massive release of drugs.",

If the desired pharmacological conversion is not achieved after 3 or 4 doses, the dose may be increased cautiously. As an alternative regimen, patients may have been prescribed 1 tablet (equivalent to 202 mg of quinidine base) every 8 hours for 2 days, followed by 2 tablets (equivalent to 403 mg of quinidine base) every 12 hours for 2 days, and, finally, 2 tablets (equivalent to 403 mg of quinidine base) every 8 hours for up to 4 days. For the final 4-day treatment plan, the lower dose may be opted at the physician's discretion.",
