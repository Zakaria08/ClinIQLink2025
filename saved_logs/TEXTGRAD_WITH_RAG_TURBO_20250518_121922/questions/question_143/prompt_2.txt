With your own knowledge and the help of the following document:

Document 1 (Title: Quinidine -- Administration -- Dosage Regimens): Oral immediate-release formulation: The initial therapy involves administering 2 tablets of 200 mg each every 6 hours to the patients. The dose may be cautiously increased if the desired pharmacological conversion is not achieved after 4 to 5 doses. Oral extended-release formulation: For the first treatment option, patients are administered 2 tablets of 324 mg each (equivalent to 403 mg of quinidine base) every 8 hours. If the desired pharmacological conversion is not achieved after 3 or 4 doses, the dose may be increased cautiously. As an alternative regimen, patients may have been prescribed 1 tablet (equivalent to 202 mg of quinidine base) every 8 hours for 2 days, followed by 2 tablets (equivalent to 403 mg of quinidine base) every 12 hours for 2 days, and, finally, 2 tablets (equivalent to 403 mg of quinidine base) every 8 hours for up to 4 days. For the final 4-day treatment plan, the lower dose may be opted at the physician's discretion.
Document 2 (Title: Resinous glaze): Pharmaceutical glaze is used by the drug and nutritional supplement industry as a coating material for tablets and capsules. It serves to improve the product's appearance, extend shelf life and protect it from moisture, as well as provide a solid finishing film for pre-print coatings. It also serves to mask unpleasant odors and aid in the swallowing of the tablet. The shellac coating is insoluble in stomach acid and may make the tablet difficult for the body to break down or assimilate. For this reason, it can also be used as an ingredient in time-released, sustained or delayed-action pills. The product is listed on the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) inactive ingredient list.
Document 3 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Lialda is a once-a-day formulation of mesalamine (Multi-Matrix System [MMX]) designed to release mesalamine in the colon. The MMX technology incorporates mesalamine into a lipophilic matrix within a hydrophilic matrix encapsulated in a polymer resistant to degradation at a low pH (<7) to delay release throughout the colon. The safety profile appears to be comparable to other 5-ASA formulations. Apriso is a formulation containing encapsulated mesalamine granules that delivers mesalamine to the terminal ileum and colon via a proprietary extended-release mechanism (Intellicor). The outer coating (Eudragit L) dissolves at a pH >6. In addition, there is a polymer matrix core that aids in sustained release throughout the colon. Because Lialda and Apriso are given once daily, an anticipated benefit is improved compliance compared with two to four daily doses required for other mesalamine preparations.

Please identify which of the following solid oral forms are designed for sustained or extended release of the active ingredient.

Options:
1. Hydrophilic matrix
2. Tablet with insoluble film coating
3. Double-core tablets
4. Tablets based on ion exchange resins
5. Lipophilic matrix
