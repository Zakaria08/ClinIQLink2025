Document 1 (Title: Adherence to recommendations for early repeat cervical smear tests.): To assess adherence to recommendations for an early repeat cervical smear test in women with reports of cytological abnormalities, and to evaluate the impact of reminder letters to medical practitioners when such smear tests are overdue. Observational study. Cytology (gynaecological) service for Victoria, Australia. Two groups of women who had abnormal cervical smears during 1985. Women in group A had some evidence of an important dysplasia and were advised to have a repeat smear in three months' time whereas women in group B had a less serious abnormality and were advised to have a repeat smear test in six months' time. In all, 971 of the 1036 women in group A and 1401 of the 1464 women in group B were eligible to have a repeat smear analysed by the service. If a repeat smear had not been received within three months of the recommended date a reminder letter generated by the service's computer was sent to the medical practitioner who had taken the smear. Thirty six months after the report on the abnormal smear was issued. In all, 870 (90%) of the women in group A and 1154 (82%) of the women in group B had a repeat smear test. The mean time to a repeat test was 3.0 months (95% confidence interval 0.5 to 16.4) in group A and 6.0 months (1.2 to 30.3) in group B. The reminder letter to the practitioner potentially increased the rate of return for a repeat smear test by 18% in group A and 24% in group B. Adherence to the recommendation for a repeat test increased with increasing age. Achieving high rates of follow up smear tests and appropriate management in women with cytological abnormalities is critical to the impact of a screening programme for cervical cancer. The reminder system used in this study was not labour intensive or expensive and provided a fail safe mechanism for ensuring that reports of abnormal smears were not overlooked.
Document 2 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Beginning regular exercise for a 40-year-old 9 months–2 years man (30 min, 3 times a week) result often varies across settings. For some tests such as screening mammography and screening chest CT, a false-positive result occurs when an abnormality is identified that is not malignant, requiring either a biopsy diagnosis or short-term follow-up. For other tests such as Pap smears, a false-positive result occurs because the test identifies a wide range of potentially premalignant states, only a small percentage of which would ever progress to an invasive cancer. This risk is closely tied to the risk of overdiagnosis in which the screening test identifies disease that would not have presented clinically in the patient’s lifetime. Assessing the degree of overdiagnosis from a screening test is very difficult given the need for long-term follow-up of an unscreened population to determine the true incidence of disease over time. Recent estimates suggest that as much as 15–25% of breast
Document 3 (Title: Abnormal Papanicolaou Smear -- Clinical Significance): Atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance , ASC-US: This management plan depends on the age of the patient. For patients between 21 and 24, repeat Pap smear in 1 year if the status of the HPV is positive or unknown. It is also acceptable to perform a reflex HPV test on the same pap smear sample. HPV status will determine future pap smear frequencies. If HPV is negative, then the patient is recommended for follow-up in 3 years. If the follow-up Pap smear continues to show ASC-US, then an additional Pap smear in 1 year is recommended. For patients between 25 and 29, screening is still the same if they have negative HPV. However, if they have positive HPV, colposcopy is recommended instead of waiting one year for a follow-up pap smear. If at the follow-up pap smear, ASC-US is still present, the next step is colposcopy. For patients between 30 to 65 years of age, there is a more significant concern for the progression of cervical cancer. If ASC-US is documented on a pap smear and they are HPV negative, they will follow the same process as the other age groups. If HPV status is positive or unknown, then a repeat pap smear is recommended within four months.
