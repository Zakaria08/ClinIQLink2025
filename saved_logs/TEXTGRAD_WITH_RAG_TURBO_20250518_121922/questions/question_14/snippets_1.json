        "content": "During embryology, the nervous system is developed from the ectodermal germ layer. In the beginning, the notochord is beneath the ectoderm and induces the ectoderm to differentiate into the neuroectoderm and the neural plate. It is the neural plate that will further differentiate into the neural tube and the neural crest cells. The neural tube is responsible for developing the central nervous system. While the neural crest is responsible for the development of the peripheral nervous system.",

        "title": "Distribution and function of tenascin during cranial neural crest development in the chick.",
        "content": "Tenascin is a glycoprotein associated with the extracellular matrix and the surface of some cell types. Here, the distribution and possible function of tenascin have been examined along the pathways followed by cranial neural crest cells. During early stages of neural crest migration, tenascin was observed in a dense matrix surrounding premigratory cranial neural crest cells. Along the neural tube, tenascin immunoreactivity was observed in a dorsoventral gradient and was also noted under the ectoderm and around the notochord. During advanced neural crest migration, tenascin immunoreactivity colocalized with and appeared to be on the surface of migrating neural crest cells. At later stages, tenascin was present around the otic vesicles, retina, lens, and in an interstitial matrix in the region of the branchial arches. At the level of the occipital somites, tenascin immunoreactivity was observed around the neural tube, notochord, dermamyotome, and on the basal surface of the ectoderm. Tenascin was also observed in an interstitial matrix within the sclerotome. At early stages of vagal neural crest migration, immunoreactivity was uniform within the sclerotome, whereas at later stages tenascin colocalized with vagal neural crest cells within the rostral half of each sclerotome. The possible function of tenascin was tested by injecting antitenascin antibodies lateral to the mesencephalic neural tube. Two predominant defects were noted in injected embryos: 1) ectopic aggregates of cranial neural crest cells external to the neural tube and sometimes located on the apical side of the ectoderm; and 2) open and deformed neural tubes. Both the distribution and results of the perturbation experiment suggest that tenascin is required for proper cranial neural crest migration.",
