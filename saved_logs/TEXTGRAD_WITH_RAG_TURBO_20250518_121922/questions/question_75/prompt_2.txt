Document 1 (Title: Amblyopia: etiology, detection, and treatment.): Amblyopia is a preventable cause of visual loss in children that may be permanent unless it is detected and treated early. It may be caused by strabismus, refractive errors, or cataracts. Primary strabismus may lead to loss of vision from amblyopia and the loss of binocularity. Secondary strabismus may be a sign of primary visual loss in one or both eyes. The most serious disorder that may present as secondary strabismus is retinoblastoma. It is imperative to detect retinoblastoma early because of its morbidity and mortality. Amblyopia is detected by assessing the visual acuity of each eye. Strabismus is detected by using the corneal light reflex test and the cover test. Focusing problems are detected by assessing the visual acuity and the red reflex. Cataracts and retinoblastoma may be detected by examining the red reflex of the eye. Treatment of amblyopia consists of correcting the amblyogenic factor with appropriate glasses and surgery. The preferred eye is patched with an adhesive patch to stimulate visual development in the amblyopic eye. The pediatrician plays a crucial role in the early detection of amblyopia, strabismus, and cataracts. The key to successful visual outcome is early recognition by the pediatrician, referral to the pediatric ophthalmologist, and prompt treatment.
Document 2 (Title: Amblyopia -- Etiology -- Occlusion or Reverse Amblyopia): The severity of resulting amblyopia tends to be more pronounced when the degree of visual deprivation is greater. The critical period for visual development is primarily concentrated within the first 7 years of life, with the initial few years and even months being particularly critical. [18] Delaying the start of amblyopia treatment makes it increasingly challenging to achieve clinical reversal of the condition. Early-onset visual deprivation can lead to permanent anatomic alterations in the magnocellular (M) and parvocellular (P) visual pathways.
Document 3 (Title: Neurology_Adams): Simultaneous impairment of vision in the two eyes, with central or centrocecal scotomas, is often caused by nutritional deficiency. This occurrence is observed most often in the chronically alcoholic or malnourished patient. Impairment of visual acuity evolves over several days to weeks, and examination discloses bilateral, roughly symmetrical central or centrocecal scotomas, with the peripheral fields being intact. With appropriate treatment (nutritious diet and vitamins B) instituted soon after the onset of visual loss, recovery is possible. If treatment is delayed, patients are left with varying degrees of permanent defect in central vision and pallor of the temporal portions of the optic discs. This disorder has been referred to as “tobacco-alcohol amblyopia,” the implication being that it is caused by the toxic effects of tobacco or alcohol or both. In fact, the problem is more likely one of nutritional deficiency and is more properly designated as deficiency amblyopia or
