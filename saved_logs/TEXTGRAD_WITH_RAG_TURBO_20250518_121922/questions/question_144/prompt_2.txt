With your own knowledge and the help of the following document:

Document 1 (Title: Ampicillin -- Indications -- FDA-approved Indications): Respiratory tract infection: caused by: Streptococcus pneumoniae , penicillinase, and non-penicillinase-producing Staphylococcus aureus , group A beta-hemolytic Streptococci, Hemophilus influenzae . Bacterial meningitis: caused by Gram-negative bacteria: Neisseria meningitis , Escherichia coli , Gram-positive bacteria: Listeria monocytogenes, Group B Streptococci . Adding aminoglycosides increases its effectiveness against gram-negative bacteria. [2] Septicemia and endocarditis: caused by Gram-positive bacteria, including penicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus species , Streptococcus species , and Enterococcus species. Gram-negative bacteria include Escherichia coli , Salmonella species , and Proteus mirabilis . Endocarditis caused by enterococci usually responds to intravenous ampicillin. Adding aminoglycosides with ampicillin may increase its effectiveness when treating endocarditis caused by streptococci. [3]
Document 2 (Title: Immunology_Janeway): Physical contact Trichophyton Bacillus anthracis Clostridium tetani Francisella tularensis Athlete’s foot Mosquito bites (Aedes aegypti) Deer tick bites Mosquito bites (Anopheles) Flavivirus Borrelia burgdorferi Plasmodium spp. Yellow fever Lyme disease Malaria Minor skin abrasions Puncture wounds Handling infected animals Cutaneous anthrax Tetanus Tularemia Route of entry Mode of transmission Pathogen Disease External epithelia Mucosal surfaces Routes of infection for pathogens Mouth and respiratory tract Contaminated water or food Sexual transmission/ infected blood Sexual transmission Neisseria meningitidis Bacillus anthracis Meningococcal meningitis Inhalation anthrax Fungus Virus Bacterium (spirochete) Protozoan Gram-positive bacterium Gram-positive bacterium Gram-negative bacterium Type of pathogen Hepatitis B virus Hepatitis B Hepadnavirus Neisseria gonorrhoeae Gonorrhea Gram-negative bacterium Human immunodefciency virus (HIV) Acquired immunodefciency syndrome (AIDS)
Document 3 (Title: Mesophile): Examples Some notable mesophiles include Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli. Other examples of species of mesophiles are Clostridium kluyveri, Pseudomonas maltophilia, Thiobacillus novellus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Different types of diseases and infections typically have pathogens from mesophilic bacteria such as the ones listed above. Listeria monocytogenes Listeria monocytogenes is a gram-positive bacterium. It is closely related to Bacillus and Staphylococcus. It is a rod-shaped, facultative anaerobe that is motile by peritrichous flagella. L. monocytogenes motility is limited from 20 °C to 25 °C. At the optimal temperature, it loses its motility. This bacterium is responsible for listeriosis which derives from contaminated food.

Please provide comprehensive and accurate information about Listeria monocytogenes, detailing its characteristics, modes of transmission, prevention strategies, and potential health impacts.

Options:
1. It is a Gram-positive bacillus
2. It is a flagellated bacterium
3. It is an agent of meningitis
4. It is never pathogenic for adults
5. It is naturally resistant to aminoglycosides
