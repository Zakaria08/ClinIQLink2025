A ase of spinal epidural abscess as a complication of Fournier's gangrene is presented. The infection appears to have spread by the hematogenous route. The patient had several symptoms, including fever, which could have provided an early diagnostic clue. Multiple fever workups were negative, however, and the diagnosis was not made until quadriplegia developed. A lumbar puncture as part of the fever workup might have allowed for an earlier diagnosis and more prompt surgery.",
