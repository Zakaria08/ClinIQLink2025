        "content": "A 42-year-old woman had a 10-year history of external ophthalmoplegia, malabsorption resulting in chronic malnutrition, muscle atrophy and polyneuropathy. Computer tomography revealed hypodensity of her cerebral white matter. A metabolic disturbance consisted of lactic acidosis after moderate glucose loads with increased excretion of hydroxybutyric and fumaric acids. Post-mortem studies revealed gastrointestinal scleroderma as the morphological manifestation of her malabsorption syndrome, ocular and skeletal myopathy with ragged red fibers, peripheral neuropathy, vascular abnormalities of meningeal and peripheral nerve vessels. Biochemical examination of the liver and muscle tissues revealed a partial defect of cytochrome-c-oxidase (complex IV of the respiratory chain). This mitochondrial multisystem disorder may represent a separate entity to be classified between the spectrum of myoencephalopathies and oculo-gastrointestinal muscular dystrophy.",

        "content": "When interpreting abnormal blood clotting study results, it's essential to consider the clinical context, medical history, and potential contributing factors. For example, a patient on anticoagulant therapy may have intentionally prolonged PT and INR values. Similarly, a patient with liver disease may exhibit abnormal PT and PTT due to impaired synthesis of clotting factors. Addressing abnormal values involves a multidisciplinary approach. In collaboration with other specialists, a hematologist can determine the underlying cause and develop a tailored treatment plan. This may include administering clotting factor concentrates, adjusting anticoagulant medications, or addressing the specific condition contributing to the abnormal clotting profile.",
