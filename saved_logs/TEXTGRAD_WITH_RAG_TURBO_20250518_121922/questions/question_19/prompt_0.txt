Document 1 (Title: Wernicke Encephalopathy (Nursing) -- Medical Management): The aim of treatment is prompt and quick correction of the thiamine deficiency in the brain. Wernicke encephalopathy is a medical emergency and considered a reversible condition, therefore, requiring immediate emergent attention although the onset of the disease may be acute or chronic. Parenteral administration of thiamine is most effective and provides for rapid administration, however, in some cases, there are persistent neurological deficits, and the acute condition can progress to chronic Korsakoff syndrome. The preferred dose of thiamine treatment for Wernicke encephalopathy may be as high as 500 mg given one to three times daily parenterally. All malnourished patient may need higher doses of thiamine. There is some evidence that thiamine treatment can improve the confusional state, quick resolution of ataxia, ophthalmoplegia, and nystagmus. Thiamine is generally administered before or together with glucose solutions because the glucose oxidation can decrease thiamine levels thereby exacerbating the neurological symptoms of Wernicke encephalopathy. Patient with magnesium deficiency should also be treated as this can result in reduced recovery from Wernicke encephalopathy especially in patients with alcoholism. [8] [9] [10]
Document 2 (Title: Alitretinoin): Hepatic insufficiency Severe chronic kidney disease Uncontrolled hypercholesterolemia Uncontrolled hypertriglyceridemia Uncontrolled hypothyroidism Hypervitaminosis A Hypersensitivity to any excipients in alitretinoin Interactions It is a CYP3A4 substrate and hence any inhibitor or inducer of this enzyme may alter plasma levels of alitretinoin. It should not be given to patients with excess vitamin A in their system as there is a potential for its actions on the retinoid X receptor to be exacerbated. It may also interact with tetracyclines to cause benign intracranial hypertension. Overdose Alitretinoin is a form of vitamin A. Alitretinoin has been administered in oncological clinical studies at dosages of more than 10-times of the therapeutic dosage given for chronic hand eczema. The adverse effects observed were consistent with retinoid toxicity, and included severe headache, diarrhoea, facial flushing and hypertriglyceridemia. These effects were reversible.
Document 3 (Title: Wernicke's encephalopathy.): Wernicke's encephalopathy should be considered as a possible diagnosis in comatose and hypothermic patients. The classic triad of confusion, ophthalmoplegia (or nystagmus) and ataxia may be absent, and the history of alcohol abuse or other causes of thiamine deficiency may be unknown. Left untreated, acute Wernicke's encephalopathy has a 17 percent mortality rate. Since the morbidity from Wernicke's encephalopathy is potentially reversible with parenteral thiamine, and large doses of thiamine can be given without documented ill effects, it is recommended that all comatose or hypothermic patients, as well as those with more classic presentations of Wernicke's encephalopathy, be given parenteral thiamine before administration of glucose.

A 27-year-old female with a chronic illness visits the general medical clinic. What potential vitamin deficiency complication should be considered in this patient given her chronic condition?

Options:
A. It may result in corneal vascularization
B. It may result in the triad of confusion, ophthalmoplegia, and ataxia
C. It may be exacerbated by excessive ingestion of raw eggs
D. It may manifest itself as a prolonged PT
