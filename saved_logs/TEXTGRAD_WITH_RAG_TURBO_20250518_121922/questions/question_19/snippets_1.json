        "content": "The aim of treatment is prompt and quick correction of the thiamine deficiency in the brain. Wernicke encephalopathy\u00a0is a medical emergency and considered a reversible condition, therefore, requiring immediate emergent attention although the onset of the disease may be acute or chronic. Parenteral administration of thiamine is most effective and provides for rapid administration, however, in some cases, there are persistent neurological deficits, and the acute condition can progress to chronic Korsakoff syndrome. The preferred dose of thiamine treatment for Wernicke encephalopathy\u00a0may be as high as 500 mg given one to three times daily parenterally. All malnourished patient may need higher doses of thiamine. There is some\u00a0evidence that thiamine treatment can improve the confusional state, quick resolution of ataxia, ophthalmoplegia, and nystagmus. Thiamine is generally\u00a0administered before or together with glucose solutions because the glucose oxidation can decrease thiamine levels thereby\u00a0exacerbating the neurological symptoms of Wernicke encephalopathy. Patient with magnesium deficiency should also be treated as this can result in reduced recovery from Wernicke encephalopathy\u00a0especially in patients with alcoholism. [8] [9] [10]",

        "content": "Classically, Wernicke encephalopathy is characterised by a triad of symptoms: ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and confusion. Around 10% of patients exhibit all three features, and other symptoms may also be present. While it is commonly regarded as a condition peculiar to malnourished people with alcohol misuse, it can be caused by a variety of diseases. It is treated with thiamine supplementation, which can lead to improvement of the symptoms and often complete resolution, particularly in those where alcohol misuse is not the underlying cause. Often other nutrients also need to be replaced, depending on the cause. Wernicke encephalopathy may be present in the general population with a prevalence of around 2%, and is considered underdiagnosed; probably, many cases are in patients who do not have commonly-associated symptoms.",
