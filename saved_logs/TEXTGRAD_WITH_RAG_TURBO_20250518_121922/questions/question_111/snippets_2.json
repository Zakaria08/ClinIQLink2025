        "content": "FIGURE 2\u20135 Known transmembrane signaling mechanisms: 1: A lipid-soluble chemical signal crosses the plasma membrane and acts on an intracellular receptor (which may be an enzyme or a regulator of gene transcription); 2: the signal binds to the extracellular domain of a transmembrane protein, thereby activating an enzymatic activity of its cytoplasmic domain; 3: the signal binds to the extracellular domain of a transmembrane receptor bound to a separate protein tyrosine kinase, which it activates; 4: the signal binds to and directly regulates the opening of an ion channel; 5: the signal binds to a cell-surface receptor linked to an effector enzyme by a G protein. (A, C, substrates; B, D, products; R, receptor; G, G protein; E, effector [enzyme or ion channel]; Y, tyrosine; P, phosphate.) Although the five established mechanisms do not account for all the chemical signals conveyed across cell membranes, they do transduce many of the most important signals exploited in pharmacotherapy.",

        "title": "Glucagon receptor",
        "content": "Signal transduction pathway A glucagon receptor, upon binding with the signaling molecule glucagon, initiates a signal transduction pathway that begins with the activation of adenylate cyclase, which in turn produces cyclic AMP (cAMP). Protein kinase A, whose activation is dependent on the increased levels of cAMP, is responsible for the ensuing cellular response in the form of protein kinase 1 and 2. The ligand-bound glucagon receptor can also initiate a concurrent signaling pathway that is independent of cAMP by activating phospholipase C. Phospholipase C produces DAG and IP3 from PIP2, a phospholipid phospholipase C cleaves off of the plasma membrane. Ca2+ stores inside the cell release Ca2+ when its calcium channels are bound by IP3.

        "title": "Signal transduction via G-protein-linked receptors: physiological regulation from the plasma membrane to the genome.",
        "content": "Many neurotransmitters, hormones, and drugs express their actions through binding to cell-surface receptors that are coupled to membrane-localized effectors via GTP-binding regulatory proteins (G-proteins). Muscarinic acetylcholine, alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors are members of this populous class of G-protein-linked receptors. Adenylyl cyclase, phospholipase C, and ion channel activities are examples of effectors regulated via these receptors. Signal transduction via G-protein-linked receptors can be regulated at the level of the receptor, G-protein(s), and effector(s). Activation of G-protein-mediated pathway propagates the signal and leads to desensitization (short-term adaptation) and then down-regulation (long-term adaptation). How transmembrane signaling is linked to expression at the level of the gene (transcriptional control), at the level of mRNA (post-transcriptional control) and at the level of the protein (post-translational modification) remains a central question of neurobiology. Investigations at each of these potential loci for regulation have begun to reveal the molecular basis for down-regulation by agonist, up-regulation by permissive hormones (like adrenal steroids), and cross-regulation among G-protein-mediated pathways. The general topic will be discussed drawing upon recent studies of the regulation of the adrenergic receptor family (alpha- and beta-). These recent advances provide a focus for a broader understanding of the integration of information between the genome and transmembrane signaling.",
