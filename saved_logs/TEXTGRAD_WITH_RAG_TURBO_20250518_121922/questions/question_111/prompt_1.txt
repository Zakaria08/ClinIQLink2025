With your own knowledge and the help of the following document:

Document 1 (Title: Physiology, Cellular Messengers -- Function): Receptor tyrosine kinases are transmembrane receptors with tyrosine kinase activity. They are activated when ligand causes dimerization and autophosphorylation of the tyrosine residues of the cytoplasmic domain. Ligands for these receptors include insulin and growth factors. Effectors associated with tyrosine kinase receptors are phospholipase C (part of the IP3/DAG pathway, which cleaves PIP2 into IP3 and DAG) and Ras. Ras activates other signal transduction pathways like MAP (mitogen-activated protein) kinase that are needed for cell growth and proliferation.
Document 2 (Title: Involvement of G proteins, cytoplasmic calcium, phospholipases, phospholipid-derived second messengers, and protein kinases in signal transduction from mitogenic cell surface receptors.): Some putative mitogenic signal transduction mechanisms involving G proteins, calcium, phospholipases, and protein kinases have been discussed. Several elements in this signal transduction scheme are not yet well understood and require further experimental investigation. With regard to the heptahelix receptors, exactly how do they activate PLA2? Is PLA2 activation linked to mitogenic pathways? Is this via stimulation of protein kinase C or perhaps another mechanism? How do heptahelix receptors activate tyrosine phosphorylation, and is it important in their ability to stimulate cell growth? With regard to the various phospholipases that are thought to be regulated by receptor-mediated stimuli, only PI-PLC beta and PI-PLC gamma are well characterized. PLA2, PC-PLD, and PC-PLC require further study in regard to determination of molecular structure and elucidation of mechanisms of phospholipase activation (e.g., what are the molecular mechanisms whereby tyrosine kinases and Ras affect PC-PLC?). The protein kinase C dependent and protein kinase C independent mechanisms that enable mitogenic stimuli to activate the Erk/MAP kinase are enigmatic at this time. How Raf-1 activates SRE-containing gene promoters (such as the fos promoter) is also not known. However, given the current rapid rate of progress in this field, it is likely that a much more complete understanding of the mitogenic signal transduction process will soon be obtained.
Document 3 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): A. Alpha Receptors Alpha1 receptors are coupled via G proteins in the Gq family to phospholipase C. This enzyme hydrolyzes polyphosphoinositides, leading to the formation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG) (Table 9–1, Figure 9–1). IP3 promotes the release of sequestered Ca2+ from intracellular stores, which increases cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentrations that activate various calcium-dependent protein kinases. Activation of these receptors may also increase influx of calcium across the cell’s plasma membrane. IP3 is sequentially dephosphorylated, which ultimately leads to the formation of free inositol. DAG cooperates with Ca2+ in activating protein kinase C, which modulates activity of many signaling pathways. In addition, α1 receptors activate signal transduction pathways that stimulate tyrosine kinases. For example, α1 receptors have been found to activate mitogenactivated protein kinases (MAP kinases) and polyphosphoinositol3-kinase (PI-3-kinase).
