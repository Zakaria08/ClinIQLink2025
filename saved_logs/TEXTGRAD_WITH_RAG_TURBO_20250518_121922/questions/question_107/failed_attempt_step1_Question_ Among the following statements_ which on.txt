== Answer ==
{"answer": ["1", "5"]}

== Feedback ==
Incorrect answer: The answer should be {"answer": ["2", "5"]} because a diode array detector uses polychromatic light and is usable in liquid chromatography; the prompt should clarify the specific characteristics of a diode array detector to avoid confusion.
