Document 1 (Title: Annular pancreas): Causes It is typically associated with abnormal embryological development, however adult cases can develop. It can result from growth of a bifid ventral pancreatic bud around the duodenum, where the parts of the bifid ventral bud fuse with the dorsal bud, forming a pancreatic ring. It can also result if the ventral pancreatic bud fails to fully rotate, so it remains on the right or if the dorsal bud rotates in the wrong direction, such that the duodenum is surrounded by pancreatic tissue. Blockage of the duodenum develops if inflammation (pancreatitis) develops in the annular pancreas.
Document 2 (Title: Clinical relevance of an unfused pancreatic duct system.): In man, the main pancreatic duct is normally derived from ventral and dorsal embryological buds of the pancreas. In a minority of people, failure of fusion of the two buds results in separate drainage of the dorsal and ventral pancreas, so that the accessory duct provides the main drainage for the gland. Patients with this anomaly demonstrated at endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (ERP) have been investigated to assess whether non-fusion of the main pancreatic duct predisposes to the development of pancreatitis. A failure of fusion of the pancreatic ducts was seen in 21 out of 449 (4.7%) successful pancreatograms; four of these 21 patients had definite clinical evidence of pancreatitis and two patients had possible pancreatic disease, but in the remainder the anomaly was not considered to be clinically relevant. An abnormal pancreatogram suggesting pancreatitis was present in 116 out of the 428 patients (27.1%) with a normally fused duct system. The anomaly was found as frequently in the whole series as it was seen in patients with pancreatitis. These findings suggest that embryological failure of pancreatic duct fusion does not predispose to the development of pancreatitis. However, the presence of this anomaly may lead to misinterpretation of ultrasonographic and CT scan findings.
Document 3 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): to avoid injury to the pancreatic tail during left colectomy or splenectomy.Pancreatic Duct AnatomyAn understanding of embryology is required to appreciate the common variations in pancreatic duct anatomy. The pancreas is formed by the fusion of a ventral and dorsal bud (Fig. 33-3). The duct from the smaller ventral bud, which arises from the hepatic diverticulum, connects directly to the common bile duct. The duct from the larger dorsal bud, which arises from the duodenum, drains directly into the duodenum. The duct of the ventral anlage becomes the duct of Wirsung, and the duct from the dorsal anlage becomes the duct of Santorini. With gut rotation, the ventral anlage rotates to the right and around the posterior side of the duodenum to fuse with the dorsal bud. The ventral anlage becomes the inferior portion of the pancreatic head and the unci-nate process, while the dorsal anlage becomes the body and tail of the pancreas. The ducts from each anlage usually fuse together in the

A 3-week-old infant is brought to the pediatrician by the mother. The infant presents with specific symptoms that warrant further investigation. Based on this clinical picture, which embryologic development error is most likely responsible for these symptoms?

Options:
A. Abnormal migration of ventral pancreatic bud
B. Complete failure of proximal duodenum to recanalize
C. Abnormal hypertrophy of the pylorus
D. Failure of lateral body folds to move ventrally and fuse in the midline
