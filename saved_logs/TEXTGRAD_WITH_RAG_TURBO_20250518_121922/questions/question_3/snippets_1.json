        "content": "Another possible congenital malformation of the pancreas is the annular pancreas. The embryologic mechanism by which this occurs is from a failure of rotation of the ventral pancreatic bud. In normal development, the ventral pancreatic bud undergoes rotation with the duodenum. Lack of rotation may cause the ventral pancreatic bud to encircle the duodenum and possibly constrict it. The major complication that may result is small bowel obstruction. Similar to pancreas divisum, many patients with annular pancreas are asymptomatic. Patients who develop symptoms may present with features of a small bowel obstruction, such as bilious vomiting, abdominal pain and distension, and the inability to have a bowel movement.",

        "title": "Prepyloric gastric antral web: a puzzling epidemic.",
        "content": "Antral webs and diaphragms are considered a rare cause of gastric outlet obstruction in infants and children. A radiographic diagnosis of antral web was made in 28 children during a 26-mo period. Nonbilious, often projectile vomiting was the predominant presenting symptom in 24 infants who were less than 6 mo of age. The older children complained of pain, vomiting, fullness after eating, and eructation. The characteristic radiologic finging was a wirelike transverse septum 1--2 cm proximal to the pylorus. Poor antral filling was an important early clue in the radiographic search for the webs. Pyloroplasty was performed in 20 patients, frequently after failure of medical management of symptoms. Coexistent congenital abnormalities were present in 28% of patients. A search for environmental and familial factors has failed to elucidate any teratogenic influences in this population.",
