With your own knowledge and the help of the following document:

Document 1 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): General supportive care is essential. After massive aspirin ingestions (eg, more than 100 tablets), aggressive gut decontamination is advisable, including gastric lavage, repeated doses of activated charcoal, and consideration of whole bowel irrigation. Intravenous fluids are used to replace fluid losses caused by tachypnea, vomiting, and fever. For moderate intoxications, intravenous sodium bicarbonate is given to alkalinize the urine and promote salicylate excretion by trapping the salicylate in its ionized, polar form. For severe poisoning (eg, patients with severe acidosis, coma, and serum salicylate level >90–100 mg/dL), emergency hemodialysis is performed to remove the salicylate more quickly and restore acid-base balance and fluid status.
Document 2 (Title: Cyanide poisoning: pathophysiology and current approaches to therapy.): Considering the difficulties following the administration of nitrites (or aminophenols) or cobalt-EDTA as well as the ineffectivenes of hydroxycobalamin and pyruvate, we feel that a more sensible treatment for acute cyanide intoxication is hemodialysis combined with the intravenous administration of sodium thiosulfate. The addition of hemodialysis to such a regimen is helpful in three ways. First, it removes the small extracellular reservoir of cyanide, particularly if the poison is still being absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Second, it corrects the severe lactic acidosis seen in virtually all cases of cyanide toxicity. As with most poisons death from metabolic acidosis alone is likely. Third, the removal of thiocyanate, the end product of cyanide metabolism, results in a maneuver which should decrease both tissue and plasma cyanide levels. The immediate treatment of acute cyanide intoxication is supportive, as it is with most all drugs and poisons. Gastric lavage using activated charcoal should be initiated immediately to remove any remaining cyanide in the gastrointestinal tract. Simultaneously, high flow oxygen should be administered either by nasal cannula or by endotracheal intubation. Correction of the metabolic acidosis should be instituted with bicarbonate. Immediate hemodialysis should be performed with the concomitant administration of thiosulfate. Animal studies suggest that continuous infusion of thiosulfate (12 mg/kg/hr) is more effective for treating cyanide intoxication than is bolus administration (41, 51). Bolus administration is the currently recommended form of thiosulfate therapy in humans. The Lilly kit contains a 50 ml ampule of thiosulfate having 12.5 gm, which in adults may be repeated once at one-half the dose.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Document 3 (Title: Salicylates Toxicity -- Treatment / Management): Patients with salicylate toxicity are volume depleted due to hyperventilation, fever, and increased metabolic activity. Fluid resuscitation should utilize D5 with 3 amps of sodium bicarbonate. The dextrose will treat the central nervous system (CNS) hypoglycemia. The sodium bicarb will help correct the metabolic acidosis. Potassium may be supplemented if hypokalemia is present. Goal urine output is 2 to 3 mL/kg per hour. [8] [9]

Provide a detailed overview of salicylate poisoning, discussing its symptoms, available treatment options, and effective management strategies.

Options:
1. Young children are more sensitive than adults to salicylate overdose
2. The use of activated charcoal is not recommended during gastric lavage
3. Intravenous administration of sodium bicarbonate allows correction of metabolic acidosis
4. Intravenous administration of sodium bicarbonate increases urinary elimination of salicylates
5. Hyperventilation is common at the beginning of the intoxication
