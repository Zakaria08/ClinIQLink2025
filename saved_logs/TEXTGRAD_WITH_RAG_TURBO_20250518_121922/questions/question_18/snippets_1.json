        "content": "A 24-year-old white male with no known medical history presented to the hospital\u00a0with chief complaints of 2 weeks of progressively worsening pain and swelling of his right\u00a0wrist\u00a0and left ankle joints. He did not report any fevers, chills, night sweats, weight loss\u00a0or rash. He was employed as a fireman. He denied alcohol use disorder,\u00a0smoking cigarettes, or any recreational drugs. Family history was significant for hypertension in father and ovarian cancer in the mother.\u00a0His vital signs were within normal limits on presentation. On\u00a0physical examination, the patient had\u00a0significant swelling of multiple joints\u00a0including the right wrist, right elbow, and left ankle. The joints were\u00a0erythematous and tender to touch. Due to severe pain, he had limited range in the involved joints.",

        "title": "Abdominal mass",
        "content": "Diagnosis The first steps in diagnosis are a medical history and physical examination. Important clues during history include weight loss, diarrhea and abdominal pain. During physical examination, the clinician must identify the location of the mass, as well as characterize its location (usually specified in terms of quadrants). The mass should be assessed for whether it is rigid or mobile. It should also be characterized for pulse or peristalsis, as these would help in further identifying the mass. Routine blood tests are usually the next step in diagnosis after a thorough medical history and physical examination. They should include a full blood count, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and liver function tests such as albumin, international normalized ratio (INR), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), serum amylase and total bilirubin (TBIL). If late-stage liver disease is suspected, then a serum glucose may be appropriate.",

        "title": "[A case of posttraumatic parkinsonism].",
        "content": "We report a case of a 52-year-old man with posttraumatic parkinsonism. He was admitted to our department because of right-sided hand tremor and gait disturbance. He had suffered from a severe head injury incurred in a traffic accident with brief unconsciousness 6 months before admission. Three weeks after his injury, tremor and rigidity in the right upper limb developed, and he walked dragging his right leg. Five months after his injury, he received 1-dopa therapy, exhibiting a moderate improvement in parkinsonian symptoms. On admission, he was demented to a mild degree with masked face and monotonous speech. He presented with resting-postural-kinetic tremor and muscle rigidity on the right side. Cranial CT and MRI showed no abnormality. Inter-peak latencies of waves III to V of BAEP were significantly longer in this patient than in normal subjects. This BAEP findings suggested an upper brainstem lesion. 123I-IMP SPECT disclosed decreased cerebral blood flow in the left thalamus, bilateral frontal and parietal cortices. We diagnosed this case as having posttraumatic parkinsonism. Parkinsonism in the present case may be due to the involvement of multiple neuronal circuits of the extrapyramidal system at the level of the midbrain to the thalamus.",
