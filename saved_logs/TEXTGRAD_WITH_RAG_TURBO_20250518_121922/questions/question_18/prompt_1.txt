Document 1 (Title: Case Study: 24-Year-Old Male Presenting With Polyarthralgias (Archived) -- Case Presentation): A 24-year-old white male with no known medical history presented to the hospital with chief complaints of 2 weeks of progressively worsening pain and swelling of his right wrist and left ankle joints. He did not report any fevers, chills, night sweats, weight loss or rash. He was employed as a fireman. He denied alcohol use disorder, smoking cigarettes, or any recreational drugs. Family history was significant for hypertension in father and ovarian cancer in the mother. His vital signs were within normal limits on presentation. On physical examination, the patient had significant swelling of multiple joints including the right wrist, right elbow, and left ankle. The joints were erythematous and tender to touch. Due to severe pain, he had limited range in the involved joints.
Document 2 (Title: Abdominal mass): Diagnosis The first steps in diagnosis are a medical history and physical examination. Important clues during history include weight loss, diarrhea and abdominal pain. During physical examination, the clinician must identify the location of the mass, as well as characterize its location (usually specified in terms of quadrants). The mass should be assessed for whether it is rigid or mobile. It should also be characterized for pulse or peristalsis, as these would help in further identifying the mass. Routine blood tests are usually the next step in diagnosis after a thorough medical history and physical examination. They should include a full blood count, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and liver function tests such as albumin, international normalized ratio (INR), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), serum amylase and total bilirubin (TBIL). If late-stage liver disease is suspected, then a serum glucose may be appropriate.
Document 3 (Title: [A case of posttraumatic parkinsonism].): We report a case of a 52-year-old man with posttraumatic parkinsonism. He was admitted to our department because of right-sided hand tremor and gait disturbance. He had suffered from a severe head injury incurred in a traffic accident with brief unconsciousness 6 months before admission. Three weeks after his injury, tremor and rigidity in the right upper limb developed, and he walked dragging his right leg. Five months after his injury, he received 1-dopa therapy, exhibiting a moderate improvement in parkinsonian symptoms. On admission, he was demented to a mild degree with masked face and monotonous speech. He presented with resting-postural-kinetic tremor and muscle rigidity on the right side. Cranial CT and MRI showed no abnormality. Inter-peak latencies of waves III to V of BAEP were significantly longer in this patient than in normal subjects. This BAEP findings suggested an upper brainstem lesion. 123I-IMP SPECT disclosed decreased cerebral blood flow in the left thalamus, bilateral frontal and parietal cortices. We diagnosed this case as having posttraumatic parkinsonism. Parkinsonism in the present case may be due to the involvement of multiple neuronal circuits of the extrapyramidal system at the level of the midbrain to the thalamus.

A 68-year-old man presents to the physician with a chief complaint of decreased mobility and frequent falls over the past few months. He has no significant past medical history and does not take any medications. He has a family history of Parkinson’s disease. On examination, the patient exhibits a shuffling gait and resting tremor. Basic laboratory tests are normal, and a neurological examination suggests potential Parkinsonism. What is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis?

Options:
A. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy
B. Hydrogen breath test
C. Cardiac stress test
D. Abdominal ultrasonography of the right upper quadrant
