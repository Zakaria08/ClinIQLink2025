With your own knowledge and the help of the following document:

Document 1 (Title: Choledocholithiasis -- Evaluation): The provider should order a white blood cell count, hemoglobin/hematocrit, platelet count, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase. In a patient with cholelithiasis, total bilirubin of greater than 3 mg/dL to 4 mg/dL, is strongly associated with choledocholithiasis. Gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase is also elevated. Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) concentrations are elevated in biliary obstruction in a cholestatic pattern, with increases in alkaline phosphatase, serum bilirubin, and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) exceeding the elevations in serum AST and ALT. The positive predictive value of elevated liver tests is poor because liver tests are elevated due to a variety of other etiologies too. Thus, normal levels help in excluding choledocholithiasis. Symptom resolution, coupled with down-trending liver function tests, suggests that a patient has spontaneously passed the gallstone. A lipase should also be checked to assess for gallstone pancreatitis. An INR with prothrombin time can be ordered to assess the intrinsic liver function as well.
Document 2 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Crigler-Najjar Syndrome, Type I CN-I is characterized by striking uncon jugated hyperbilirubinemia of about 340–765 μmol/L (20–45 mg/dL) that appears in the neonatal period and persists for life. Other conventional hepatic biochemical tests such as serum aminotransferases and alkaline phosphatase are normal, and there is no evidence of hemolysis. Hepatic histology is also essentially normal except for the occasional presence of bile plugs within canaliculi. Bilirubin glucuronides are virtually absent from the bile, and there is no detectable constitutive expression of UGT1A1 activity in hepatic tissue. Neither UGT1A1 activity nor the serum bilirubin concentration responds to administration of phenobarbital or other enzyme inducers. In the absence of conjugation, unconjugated bilirubin accumulates in plasma, from which it is eliminated very slowly by alternative pathways that include direct passage into the bile and small intestine. These account for the small amounts of urobilinogen
Document 3 (Title: Liver damage induced by intrabiliary turpentine in rats.): Inflammation of the rat bile duct induced by administration of turpentine into it has been used to study the influence of the impaired duct on liver function. Turpentine was dissolved in olive oil 1:1000 and 1:500. A 2 h ligation of the bile duct was used to promote a local effect. Contemporary groups of intact, sham-operated, control rats (given 0.9% NaCl by intrabiliary injection) and animals with total chronic obstruction were compared to assess the significance of changes. Serum concentrations of total and conjugated bilirubin, cholesterol and creatinine, activities of S-alanine-aminotransferase, S-aspartate aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase, mortality of rats, and also total body weight compared with the weight of the liver, were investigated on days 1, 4, 8, 12, 16, 32 and 64 after surgery and turpentine, or following ligation of the bile duct. An increase in bilirubin and cholesterol, an augmentation of enzymatic activity and the histological changes were indicative of hepatotoxicity or cholestasis. The turpentine concentration--effect, manifested in body-weight change, suggests some specificity of the effect. There were no changes in serum creatinine arterial blood pressure, heart rate or portal blood pressure, when turpentine was administered by the intrabiliary route. These results suggest primary liver damage.

Please list and explain the accurate characteristics and symptoms associated with cholestasis syndrome.

Options:
1. An increase in serum concentration of conjugated bilirubin
2. An increase in serum alkaline phosphatase activity
3. An increase in serum aspartate aminotransferase activity
4. Pale stools
5. A decrease in fecal urobilinogen
