The antigen-antibody reaction activates C1, which then cleaves inactive C4 to active C4a and C4b. C1 combines with C4b to form enzyme C14b. This enzyme is used to split C2 to C2a and C2b. C2a works together with enzyme C14b to form C14b2a. C14b2a, also known as C3 convertase, splits inactive C3 into active C3a and C3b.",

        "content": "Complement C2 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the C2 gene. The protein encoded by this gene is part of the classical pathway of the complement system, acting as a multi-domain serine protease. Deficiency of C2 has been associated with certain autoimmune diseases. Function In the classical and lectin pathways of complement activation, formation of the C3-convertase and C5-convertases requires binding of C2 to an activated surface-bound C4b in the presence of Mg2+; the resultant C4bC2 complex is cleaved by C1s or MASP2 into C2a and C2b. It is thought that cleavage of C2 by C1s, while bound to C4b, results in a conformational rotation of C2b whereas the released C2a fragment may retain most of its original structure.",
