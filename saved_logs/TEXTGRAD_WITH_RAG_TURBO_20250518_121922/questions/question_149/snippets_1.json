        "content": "Physical examination is usually unremarkable, especially of patients with uncomplicated malaria. They frequently present with irregular and erratic fever, reaching up to 41\u00b0C, sometimes accompanied by agitation or confusion. [3] [13] Mild spontaneously resolving jaundice can sometimes be seen in patients with otherwise-uncomplicated falciparum malaria. [3] [22] Other physical signs can include anemia and postural hypotension. [13] In some cases, patients can present with tender hepatosplenomegaly after some days. However, a palpable spleen is particularly common in otherwise healthy populations in endemic areas, reflecting repeated infections.
