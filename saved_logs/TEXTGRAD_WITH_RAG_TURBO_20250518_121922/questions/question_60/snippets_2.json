        "content": "With the scene secured and first aid provided,\u00a0law enforcement must begin to determine the boundaries of the crime scene and secure it, usually using\u00a0crime-scene tape. Potential witnesses must be identified and secured. Physical evidence must be preserved and undisturbed for a thorough investigation by other responding law enforcement, such as detectives and technicians. With these forensic responsibilities in mind, requests by police officers should generally be accommodated when\u00a0they\u00a0do not interfere with a patient's immediate needs, cause a delay in important medical care, or result in the potential deterioration of the patient's condition. EMS providers should explain what expedited medical tasks must be done and how best to accomplish those tasks. Cooperate with requests but advocate for the patient. [1] [2] [3] [4]",

        "title": "Can road traffic law enforcement permanently reduce the number of accidents?",
        "content": "In this paper it is argued that conventional analyses of road user adaptation to traffic law enforcement, based on parametric rational-choice theory, are flawed. Such analyses only consider road-user actions as a response to enforcement level and penalty size and do not simultaneously consider enforcement as a response to road-user behaviour. If each party is considered a rational agent who adapts to the other's behaviour, the proper way to analyze the outcomes is by the way of game theory. A game-theoretic model is presented and the main implications are: (i) most attempts at enforcing road traffic legislation will not have any lasting effects, either on road-user behaviour or on accidents; (ii) imposing stricter penalties (in the form of higher fines or longer prison sentences) will not affect road-user behaviour; (iii) imposing stricter penalties will reduce the level of enforcement; (iv) implementing automatic traffic surveillance techniques and/or allocating enforcement resources according to a chance mechanism, and not according to police estimates of violation probability, can make enforcement effects last, but both alternatives are difficult to implement. Relevant empirical studies are reviewed, and they seem to support the conclusions arrived at by the game-theoretic model.",
