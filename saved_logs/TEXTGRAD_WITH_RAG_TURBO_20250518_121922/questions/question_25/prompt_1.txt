Document 1 (Title: [A new steroid therapy for difficult asthmatics--an induction and maintenance, two-step therapy].): Beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) administered by inhaler is a very useful drug for the treatment of bronchial asthma. In this therapy, it is very important to use steroids systematically to induce a complete remission of asthma attack (first step) and then begin to use BDP a dose of more than 800 micrograms to maintain remission (second step). We treated 27 difficult asthmatics with this therapy and found this new method very useful. The characteristics of asthmatics were as follows. 1) The age ranged from 37 to 82, and the mean age (+/- S.E.) was 58.9 (+/- 2.6) years old. 2) The onset age ranged from 27 to 74 with a mean age (+/- S.E.) of 46.9 (+/- 2.6) year old. 3) The number of non-atopy was 22 cases. 4) The follow-up duration ranged from 5 to 45 months with a mean (+/- S.E.) of 15 (+/- 2.0) months. The results were as follows. 1) The complete remission rate was 48%, partial remission 37% and unchanged 15%. 2) There was a significant increase only in %VC. 3) The peripheral eosinophil count was decreased significantly. 4) The log value of PC20 concentration by acetylcholine increased significantly by a factor of 2.94 to 3.28. 5) After this therapy, the mean serum cortisol level at 9:00 a.m. was 10.1 (+/- 3.8, S.E.) micrograms/ml. There were only 2 cases whose cortisol level were under the normal. 6) There were many oral side effects, namely stomatitis with 5 cases and hoarseness with 8.
Document 2 (Title: Liver cancer): Because liver cancer is an umbrella term for many types of cancer, the signs and symptoms depend on what type of cancer is present. Symptoms can be vague and broad. Cholangiocarcinoma is associated with sweating, jaundice, abdominal pain, weight loss and liver enlargement. Hepatocellular carcinoma is associated with abdominal mass, abdominal pain, emesis, anemia, back pain, jaundice, itching, weight loss and fever. Treatment options may include surgery, targeted therapy and radiation therapy. In certain cases, ablation therapy, embolization therapy or liver transplantation may be used. Causes and risk factors Viral infection
Document 3 (Title: Retrognathia -- Treatment / Management): The treatment and management will depend on what the clinician's concerns are and what a patient or their parents desire. Most commonly retrognathia will be identified in children between the ages of four to ten years old and if the child has a dental home, will likely be referred to an orthodontist for evaluation ideally around the ages of seven to eight. Generally, this is a benign condition without any other effects. This will allow the orthodontist to begin tracking the patient with serial cephalometric radiographs and potentially intervene early with non-surgical therapy like headgear or newer intra-oral techniques that have a similar effect in repositioning the mandible. If the child does not have a dental home or has not seen an orthodontist, a referral is recommended. [13] [14]
