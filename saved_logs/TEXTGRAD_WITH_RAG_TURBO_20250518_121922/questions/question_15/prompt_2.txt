Document 1 (Title: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a definition and implications of structural determinants of airflow obstruction for epidemiology.): Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may be defined as a process characterized by the presence of chronic bronchitis or emphysema that may lead to the development of airways obstruction; airways obstruction need not be present at all stage of the process and may be partially reversible. The pathologic changes in the lungs due to smoking affect three regions: the bronchi, bronchioles, and parenchyma. The bronchi show enlargement of the submucosal glands with dilation of their ducts; infiltration with neutrophils and lymphocytes is present but not prominent. Respiratory bronchiolitis is observed in persons smoking for only a few years; the membranous bronchioles show a mix of inflammation, luminal mucus, goblet cell metaplasia, and distortion due to fibrosis and loss of alveolar attachments. The lung parenchyma shows centrilobular emphysema. Bronchial changes are only weakly related to airflow obstruction but bronchiolar changes are also related. The relation between airflow limitation and bronchiolitis is progressively harder to show as the severity of emphysema increases because of the dominant role of emphysema in causing airflow obstruction. Emphysema is the predominant lesion in persons with severe airflow obstruction due to COPD. The diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide is related to the severity of emphysema but is nonspecific and is mildly abnormal in smokers without emphysema. The compliance of the lungs of smokers is decreased even when a emphysema and airflow limitation are mild. Standard epidemiologic tools do not differentiate emphysema from other causes of airflow obstruction. Most persons dying of COPD will have severe emphysema.
Document 2 (Title: Lymphangioleiomyomatosis): 25% of patients with obstructive physiology may demonstrate bronchodilator responsiveness but may be less in more severe obstruction. The obstructive physiologic defect in LAM is primarily attributable to airflow obstruction. The earliest change in initial pulmonary function testing in various case series was abnormal gas transfer, as assessed by the diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO), described in 82% to 97% of patients. It is not unusual for DLCO to be reduced out of proportion to forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1). Reduction in DLCO and increase in residual volume are generally considered to be LAM's earliest physiologic manifestations.
Document 3 (Title: Bronchodilators -- Indications): Bronchodilators are indicated for individuals that have lower than optimal airflow through the lungs. The mainstay of treatment is beta-2 agonists that target the smooth muscles in the bronchioles of the lung. Various respiratory conditions may require bronchodilators, including asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. They are used to either reverse asthma symptoms or improve lung function in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Pulmonary function tests assess lung function. Thus, bronchodilators play an essential role in diagnosing and treating lung conditions based on their effect on pulmonary function tests. The FEV1/FVC ratio compares how much air flows during the first second of exhalation (forced expiratory volume) to the theoretical amount of air someone can push out in a maximum exhalation (forced vital capacity). A typical ratio is 0.7. In reversible increased airway resistance like asthma, pre-bronchodilator pulmonary function tests will typically be lower than 0.7. However, after the administration of a short-acting bronchodilator, the ratio may normalize. In nonreversible conditions like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, giving a short-acting bronchodilator may not normalize pulmonary function test levels in patients. [1] [2]
