        "title": "Restrictive lung disease",
        "content": "Restrictive lung diseases are a category of extrapulmonary, pleural, or parenchymal respiratory diseases that restrict lung expansion, resulting in a decreased lung volume, an increased work of breathing, and inadequate ventilation and/or oxygenation. Pulmonary function test demonstrates a decrease in the forced vital capacity. Presentation Due to the chronic nature of this disease, the leading symptom of restrictive lung disease is progressive exertional dyspnea. For acute on chronic cases, shortness of breath, cough, and respiratory failure are some of the more common signs. Causes Restrictive lung diseases may be due to specific causes which can be intrinsic to the parenchyma of the lung, or extrinsic to it.",

        "title": "[A case of adult Still's disease with pulmonary hypertension].",
        "content": "The patient was a 29-year-old woman. She was well until autumn 1983, when she presented with polyarthralgia, fever above 39 degrees C, hepatosplenomegaly, swelling of lymphnode and salmon pink rash. Laboratory tests revealed marked leucocytosis with shift to the left, elevated ESR, strong positivity of CRP and abnormal liver function tests. However, anti-nuclear antibody and RA factor were negative. She was diagnosed as adult onset Still's disease (AOSD) by characteristic clinical course and laboratory data. During her disease course these abnormal findings could be well controlled neither by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, immunosuppressive agents nor corticosteroids. Two and half years after the first admission, she began to complain of dry cough, dyspnea on efforts. Auscultation revealed an increased pulmonic sound and systolic murmur of cardiac apex. Chest X-Rays showed enlarged main pulmonary arteries. The lung fields were normal. Pulmonary function tests gave no evidence of a significant obstructive or restrictive defect but showed the low DLco and hypoxemia. Ventilation-perfusion lung scanning failed to reveal pulmonary embolism. Finally, right heart catheterization confirmed the pulmonary precapillary hypertension. Her pulmonary hypertension has progressed rapidly, strongly suggesting poor prognosis. Her pulmonary hypertension associated with no apparent parenchymal involvement was thought to be caused by a pulmonary vascular change probably related to AOSD. This case is a first case of AOSD with pulmonary hypertension.",

        "content": "History of Present Illness: A 33-year-old\u00a0white female presents after admission to the general medical/surgical hospital ward with a chief complaint of shortness of breath on exertion. She reports that she was seen for similar symptoms previously at her primary care physician\u2019s office six months ago.\u00a0At that time, she was diagnosed with acute bronchitis and treated with bronchodilators, empiric antibiotics, and a short course oral steroid taper. This management did not improve her symptoms, and she has gradually worsened over six months. She reports a 20-pound (9 kg) intentional weight loss over the past year. She denies camping, spelunking, or hunting activities. She denies any sick contacts. A brief review of systems is negative for fever, night sweats, palpitations, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, neural sensation changes, muscular changes, and increased bruising or bleeding. She admits a cough, shortness of breath, and shortness of breath on exertion.",
