        "content": "In order to better acknowledge the ocular fundus picture in premature infants and to determine the incidence and clinical course of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), from October 1987 to April 1989, 187 cases with a gestational age of less than 38 weeks or a birth weight of less than 2,500 g were enrolled for examination and follow-up study with indirect ophthalmoscope. One hundred and fifty cases (80.21%) were free from ROP bilaterally. Thirty-seven cases (19.79%) had ROP. Except for one case that showed unilateral regressed ROP, all were bilaterally affected. The mean birth weight and gestational age in the nonROP group were 1,824 +/- 426 g and 33.6 +/- 2.9 weeks, respectively, and in the ROP group were 1,395 +/- 490 g and 30.7 +/- 3.9 weeks, respectively. The difference for both factors between the two groups were statistically significant (p less than 0.05). Several specific fundus features were noticed in a high percentage of the nonROP group, these included a small cup to disc (C/D) ratio, pigmented ring around the disc, hypopigmented fundus and a greenish-gray color in the peripheral vascularized retina. In addition, 8.2% of this group had persistent primary vitreous remnant, and 5.6% had retinal hemorrhage. The macular development was subdivided into three stages. In both the ROP and nonROP groups, the difference of gestational age at each advancing stage was statistically significant by the Student t-test. No delay in macular development was noticed in the ROP group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "title": "Gastroschisis -- Treatment / Management -- Delivery",
        "content": "Infants with gastroschisis\u00a0have no contraindication to vaginal delivery based on gastroschisis alone. The timing of delivery is based on gestation age (lung maturity), ultrasound findings (fetal growth profile, bowel appearance), and fetal testing results. Care for the infant is usually managed by a group of specialists, including a maternal-fetal medicine specialist, neonatologist, and pediatric surgery, to discuss patient-specific factors before delivery. The mean gestational age for spontaneous delivery in women carrying infants with gastroschisis is the 36th week of gestation. [17] [18] A survey of practice patterns demonstrated forty percent of maternal-fetal medicine specialists deliver infants at 37 weeks, 30 percent deliver at 39 weeks if gastroschisis is stable. The remainder delivers infants before 37 weeks. [13] Overall, many maternal-medicine specialists allow a trial of vaginal delivery. When there is marked liver herniation, a cesarean section should be considered. One factor that some specialists utilize to determine continued gestation is if the bowel does not dilate greater than 25 mm after 37 weeks gestation.",
