        "title": "Treatment of antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody-positive systemic vasculitis and glomerulonephritis with pooled intravenous gammaglobulin.",
        "content": "Antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody (ANCA) is considered a serological marker for disease activity in patients with ANCA(+) systemic vasculitis. Recently, ANCA has been implicated as a pathogenic antibody that may be associated with neutrophil degranulation and release of lytic enzymes. Since intravenous gammaglobulin (IVIG) is known to contain antiidiotypic antibodies to ANCA, which could decrease the activity of the later, we chose to treat two patients with symptomatic ANCA(+) systemic vasculitis and glomerulonephritis with high-dose IVIG. The first patient, a 66-year-old man, developed rapidly progressive renal failure despite treatment with intravenous (IV) cyclophosphamide. The second patient, a 14-year-old boy, had relapsed 3 months after cessation of treatment with prednisone and cyclophosphamide. Both patients improved dramatically after treatment with IVIG, with the former recovering renal function within 11 days of therapy. In both patients, a concomitant reduction in serum ANCA titers was also observed. The second patient is currently in a sustained remission 14 months after his last IVIG dose on no other medication. These cases provide clinical evidence that IVIG has therapeutic benefit in modifying the immune-mediated injury associated with ANCA(+) systemic vasculitis and glomerulonephritis. In addition, IVIG may provide an additional safe therapeutic option to clinicians treating patient's with ANCA(+) vasculitis and glomerulonephritis who are not responsive to or are experiencing toxicity from conventional therapy.",

        "content": "Treatment Adult-onset Still's disease is treated with anti-inflammatory medications. Steroids such as prednisone are used to treat severe symptoms of Still's. Other commonly used medications include hydroxychloroquine, penicillamine, azathioprine, methotrexate, etanercept, anakinra, tocilizumab, cyclophosphamide, adalimumab, rituximab, and infliximab. Newer medications target interleukin-1 (IL-1), particularly IL-1\u03b2. A randomized, multicenter trial reported better outcomes in a group of 12 patients treated with anakinra than in a group of 10 patients taking other disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. On June 2020 FDA approved Ilaris (canakinumab) for the treatment of AOSD, this is the first FDA approved treatment for AOSD. Canakinumab is another anti-IL1 drug which selectively binds IL-1\u03b2 and rilonacept which blocks both IL-1A and IL-1\u03b2. The monoclonal anti-IL6 antibody tocilizumab is another treatment option as effective as anakinra.",
