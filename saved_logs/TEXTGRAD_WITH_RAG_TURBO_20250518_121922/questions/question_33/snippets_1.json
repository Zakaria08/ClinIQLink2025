        "content": "Treatment Adult-onset Still's disease is treated with anti-inflammatory medications. Steroids such as prednisone are used to treat severe symptoms of Still's. Other commonly used medications include hydroxychloroquine, penicillamine, azathioprine, methotrexate, etanercept, anakinra, tocilizumab, cyclophosphamide, adalimumab, rituximab, and infliximab. Newer medications target interleukin-1 (IL-1), particularly IL-1\u03b2. A randomized, multicenter trial reported better outcomes in a group of 12 patients treated with anakinra than in a group of 10 patients taking other disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. On June 2020 FDA approved Ilaris (canakinumab) for the treatment of AOSD, this is the first FDA approved treatment for AOSD. Canakinumab is another anti-IL1 drug which selectively binds IL-1\u03b2 and rilonacept which blocks both IL-1A and IL-1\u03b2. The monoclonal anti-IL6 antibody tocilizumab is another treatment option as effective as anakinra.",
