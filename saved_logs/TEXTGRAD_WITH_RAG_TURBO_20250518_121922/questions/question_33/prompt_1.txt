With your own knowledge and the help of the following document:

Document 1 (Title: Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma -- Treatment / Management -- B Cell Lymphoma): Mantle cell lymphoma: Mantle cell lymphoma with multiple areas of involvement is commonly treated with aggressive chemotherapy plus rituximab in eligible patients. Intense chemotherapy regimens such as R-Hyper-CVAD regimen (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin (Adriamycin), and dexamethasone, alternately given with high-dose methotrexate plus cytarabine) + rituximab, alternating RCHOP/RDHAP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone)/(rituximab, dexamethasone, cytarabine, cisplatin), NORDIC regimen (dose-intensified induction immunochemotherapy with rituximab + cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, prednisone [maxi-CHOP]) alternating with rituximab + high-dose cytarabine, or RDHAP (Rituximab, dexamethasone, cytarabine, cisplatin). After the response to initial chemotherapy, high-dose therapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation is undertaken in eligible patients. This is typically followed by maintenance of rituximab for 3 years.
Document 2 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Methotrexate, leucovorin, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone, and bleomycin (MACOP-B) and rituximab plus CHOP are effective treatments, achieving 5-year survival of 75–87%. Dose-adjusted therapy with prednisone, etoposide, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin (EPOCH) plus rituximab has produced 5-year survival of 97%. A role for mediastinal radiation therapy has not been definitively demonstrated, but it is frequently used, especially in patients whose mediastinal area remains positron emission tomography–avid after four to six cycles of chemotherapy.
Document 3 (Title: Adult-onset Still's disease): Treatment Adult-onset Still's disease is treated with anti-inflammatory medications. Steroids such as prednisone are used to treat severe symptoms of Still's. Other commonly used medications include hydroxychloroquine, penicillamine, azathioprine, methotrexate, etanercept, anakinra, tocilizumab, cyclophosphamide, adalimumab, rituximab, and infliximab. Newer medications target interleukin-1 (IL-1), particularly IL-1β. A randomized, multicenter trial reported better outcomes in a group of 12 patients treated with anakinra than in a group of 10 patients taking other disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. On June 2020 FDA approved Ilaris (canakinumab) for the treatment of AOSD, this is the first FDA approved treatment for AOSD. Canakinumab is another anti-IL1 drug which selectively binds IL-1β and rilonacept which blocks both IL-1A and IL-1β. The monoclonal anti-IL6 antibody tocilizumab is another treatment option as effective as anakinra.
