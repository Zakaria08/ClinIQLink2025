Document 1 (Title: Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma -- Treatment / Management -- B Cell Lymphoma): Mantle cell lymphoma: Mantle cell lymphoma with multiple areas of involvement is commonly treated with aggressive chemotherapy plus rituximab in eligible patients. Intense chemotherapy regimens such as R-Hyper-CVAD regimen (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin (Adriamycin), and dexamethasone, alternately given with high-dose methotrexate plus cytarabine) + rituximab, alternating RCHOP/RDHAP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone)/(rituximab, dexamethasone, cytarabine, cisplatin), NORDIC regimen (dose-intensified induction immunochemotherapy with rituximab + cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, prednisone [maxi-CHOP]) alternating with rituximab + high-dose cytarabine, or RDHAP (Rituximab, dexamethasone, cytarabine, cisplatin). After the response to initial chemotherapy, high-dose therapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation is undertaken in eligible patients. This is typically followed by maintenance of rituximab for 3 years.
Document 2 (Title: Primary effusion lymphoma): PEL is generally resistant to cancer chemotherapy drugs that are active against other B-cell lymphomas and therefore carries a poor prognosis. Overall median and 1 year survival rates in a series of 28 patients treated with chemotherapy for PEL were 6.2 months and 39.3%, respectively. In this study, the complete response rate (presumed to be temporary) to a standard CHOP chemotherapeutic regimen (i.e. cyclophosphamide doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) was only 10% whereas a more intensive CHO chemotherapy regimen which included high dose methotrexate and bleomycin achieved a compete response rate (presumed temporary) of 70%. A second study using CHOP-like regimens or one of these regimens plus methotrexate also produced better results with the latter regimens: 5 year survival rates for the CHOP-like and CHOP-like plus methotrexate regimens were 34.4% and 45.7%, respectively. A review of 105 PEL cases reported median survival times, 1 year, 3 year, and 5 year survival rates of
Document 3 (Title: Advances in chemotherapy for large cell lymphoma.): Three generations of chemotherapy regimens for the treatment of aggressive lymphomas have evolved in the past decade. The first-generation combination regimen, CVP, also known as COP (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone), produced maximum long-term survivals in considerably less than 20% of patients. With the MOPP (mechlorethamine, vincristine, procarbazine, prednisone) regimen, 40% of patients achieved complete remission (CR). This signal study was paralleled by other first-generation studies including CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone), HOP (doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone), CHOP-Bleo/BACOP (CHOP plus bleomycin), and COMLA (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, methotrexate, leucovorin, cytarabine). None of the regimens was shown to be particularly superior to the others. Survival plateaus were seen in approximately 20% to 40% of patients. Second-generation therapies, COP-BLAM (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone, bleomycin, doxorubicin, procarbazine), ProMACE-MOPP (prednisone, methotrexate, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, etoposide, mechlorethamine, vincristine, procarbazine, prednisone), M-BACOD (methotrexate, bleomycin, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, dexamethasone), and m-BACOD (same as M-BACOD, but with a moderate dose of methotrexate and modified leucovorin given on days 8 and 15 instead of just day 10) were characterized by an increasing number of drugs, more frequent administration of myelosuppressive agents, and flexible dose schedules. This new treatment intensity resulted in CRs in excess of 70%. The third generation regimens have been characterized by innovative concepts of chemotherapy, including alternative modes of drug administration, greater use of marrow-sparing, cycle-active, and/or putatively non-cross-resistant agents, and more frequent and/or intense dose administration. These regimens, COP-BLAM III, MACOP-B (methotrexate, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone, bleomycin), ProMACE-CytaBOM (ProMACE plus cytarabine, bleomycin, vincristine, methotrexate), and high-dose doxorubicin with cytarabine, have produced over 80% CRs and survival plateaus in excess of 60%. In the COP-BLAM III regimen, 84% of patients achieved a pathologic CR. Overall, 65% of patients are alive, well, and free of disease, and potentially in the survival plateau. COD-BLAM IV (same as COP-BLAM, except dexamethasone is substituted for prednisone) is a new program that further intensifies treatment by using sequential, rather than alternate-cycle, infusions of bleomycin and vincristine. Results are still preliminary, with a short median follow-up of 19 months.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

A 70-year-old man visits a medical clinic with symptoms that suggest an adverse reaction to his chemotherapy regimen. His symptoms include increased fatigue, easy bruising, and a decrease in white blood cell count. Based on these symptoms, which medication in the chemotherapy regimen is most likely responsible?

A. Methotrexate
B. Rituximab
C. Cyclophosphamide
D. Prednisone
