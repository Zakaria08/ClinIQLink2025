        "content": "Dimercaprol, also called British anti-Lewisite (BAL), is a medication used to treat acute poisoning by arsenic, mercury, gold, and lead. It may also be used for antimony, thallium, or bismuth poisoning, although the evidence for those uses is not very strong. It is given by injection into a muscle. Common side effects include high blood pressure, pain at the site of the injection, vomiting, and fever. It is not recommended for people with peanut allergies as it is typically formulated as a suspension in peanut oil. It is unclear if use in pregnancy is safe for the baby. Dimercaprol is a chelator and works by binding with heavy metals. It has a very, pungent odor. Dimercaprol was first made during World War II. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines.",

        "title": "Evaluation of the efficacy of dimercapto chelating agents for the treatment of systemic organic arsenic poisoning in rabbits.",
        "content": "1 The standard drug for the treatment of arsenic poisoning is BAL (dimercaprol). BAL possesses marked side-effects and a low safety ratio, drawbacks which new BAL analogues, DMPS and DMSA, do not possess. 2 The efficacy of three chelating agents, BAL, DMPS and DMSA, has been evaluated as a treatment for systemic organic arsenic poisoning, induced by intravenous dichloro(2-chlorovinyl)arsine (lewisite) administration to rabbits. Equimolar dosing schedules were used based upon realistic doses for the most toxic agent, BAL. 3 It was concluded that all three dimercapto chelating agents provided significant protection against the lethal systemic effects of lewisite, and, under the test conditions reported here, there was no significant difference between them in therapeutic efficacy. 4 The cause of mortality following intravenous lewisite in treated and untreated rabbits was pulmonary damage. 5 It is considered that DMPS and DMSA are worthy of further study as replacements for BAL in the treatment of systemic poisoning by lewisite.",

        "content": "The most important component of treatment for metal toxicity is the termination of exposure. Chelating agents are used to bind metals into stable cyclic compounds with relatively low toxicity and to enhance their excretion. The principal chelating agents are dimercaprol (British anti-Lewisite [BAL]), ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), succimer (dimercaptosuccinic acid [DMSA]), and penicillamine; their specific use depends on the metal involved and the clinical circumstances. Activated charcoal does not bind metals and thus is of limited usefulness in cases of acute metal ingestion. In addition to the information provided in Table 472e-1, several other aspects of exposure, toxicity, or management are worthy of discussion with respect to the four most hazardous toxicants (arsenic, cadmium, lead, and mercury).",
