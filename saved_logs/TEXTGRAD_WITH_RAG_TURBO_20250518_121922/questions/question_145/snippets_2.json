        "title": "Dimercaprol",
        "content": "Dimercaprol, also called British anti-Lewisite (BAL), is a medication used to treat acute poisoning by arsenic, mercury, gold, and lead. It may also be used for antimony, thallium, or bismuth poisoning, although the evidence for those uses is not very strong. It is given by injection into a muscle. Common side effects include high blood pressure, pain at the site of the injection, vomiting, and fever. It is not recommended for people with peanut allergies as it is typically formulated as a suspension in peanut oil. It is unclear if use in pregnancy is safe for the baby. Dimercaprol is a chelator and works by binding with heavy metals. It has a very, pungent odor. Dimercaprol was first made during World War II. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines.",

        "title": "2,3-Dimercaptosuccinic acid treatment of heavy metal poisoning in humans.",
        "content": "14 patients with heavy metal poisoning received 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA). 12 subjects were given 30 mg/kg/day for 5 days; 1 subject was started on a lower dose because of a history of atopy; another subject was treated for 15 days because of very high initial blood lead concentrations. In the 9 subjects who had lead poisoning, DMSA decreased blood lead concentrations by 35 to 81%, and induced a 4.5- to 16.9-fold increase in mean daily urinary excretion of the metal. In the acutely arsenic-poisoned case, the plasma arsenic concentration on day 7 was half the pretreatment value, while no clear decrease was observed in a chronically exposed subject. In 3 mercury cases, DMSA increased daily mercury urinary excretion 1.5-, 2.8- and 8.4-fold, respectively, while blood mercury concentrations remained below detection limits. No serious side effects were observed and 3 weeks after administration of the drug the clinical condition of all subjects was either stable or improved. These results indicate the efficacy of DMSA for lead poisoning in humans and provide a rationale for further investigating its usefulness in mercury and arsenic poisoning cases.",
