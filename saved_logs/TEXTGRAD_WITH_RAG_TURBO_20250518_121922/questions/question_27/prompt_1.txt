Document 2 (Title: McCune–Albright syndrome): Precocious puberty: The most common endocrinopathy is precocious puberty, which presents in girls (~85%) with recurrent estrogen-producing cysts leading to episodic breast development, growth acceleration, and vaginal bleeding. Precocious puberty may also occur in boys with McCune–Albright syndrome, but is much less common (~10–15%). In children of both sexes, growth acceleration may lead to tall stature in childhood, however premature bone maturation may lead to early growth plate fusion and short stature in adulthood. Testicular abnormalities: Testicular abnormalities are seen in a majority (~85%) of boys with McCune–Albright syndrome. These typically present with macro-orchidism. On pathology lesions show Leydig and Sertoli cell hyperplasia. Hyperthyroidism: Hyperthyroidism occurs in approximately one-third of patients with McCune Albright syndrome. Patients have characteristic abnormalities on thyroid ultrasound, and may have a slight increased risk for thyroid cancer.
Document 3 (Title: Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH)-independent precocious puberty unresponsive to LHRH agonist therapy in two girls lacking features of the McCune-Albright syndrome.): Two girls with precocious puberty (chronological age, 1 and 4 yr; bone age, 3 and 6 yr, respectively) were initially given the diagnosis of idiopathic, central precocious puberty and treated with the LHRH agonist deslorelin (D-Trp6-Pro9-NEt-LHRH) for 5 yr. Unlike other girls with central precocious puberty, both had persistently elevated rates of growth and bone maturation, and both menstruated during therapy. One girl had episodic ovarian enlargement and markedly elevated serum estradiol levels due to recurrent unilateral ovarian cysts. Although the bone and skin manifestations of McCune-Albright syndrome were absent, we hypothesize that the underlying defect of McCune-Albright syndrome was expressed in the ovaries, but not in the skin or bones, of these two girls. One of these girls appeared to benefit from the aromatase inhibitor testolactone, which is effective in suppressing precocious puberty in girls with the McCune-Albright syndrome.

A 5-year-old girl presents to the clinic with breast development, vaginal bleeding, and an elevated level of estrogen. Based on these symptoms, what is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:
A. Granulosa cell tumor
B. Idiopathic precocious puberty
C. McCune-Albright syndrome
D. Sertoli-Leydig tumor
