Document 1 (Title: [Primary hypertrophic cardiomyopathies. Diagnosis and treatment].): Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is currently considered to be a condition characterised by abnormal diastolic function, sometimes associated with left ventricular outflow obstruction which appears to be a secondary phenomenon. It is important to avoid overlooking this diagnosis especially in young subjects, because of the risk of sudden death, but conversely, false positive diagnosis can result in a serious social and psychological handicap. Echocardiography has assumed a major role in the diagnosis and follow-up of HCM over the last decade. It allows analysis of the localisation, extension and severity of the septal hypertrophy and of the mechanism of systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve. Cardiac doppler completes the non-invasive assessment of this condition by demonstrating the presence or absence of outflow tract obstruction, evaluating diastolic dysfunction, and documenting mitral and occasionally aortic valve regurgitation. Only severely symptomatic patients who do not respond to high dose medical therapy and for whom surgery might be an option need cardiac catheterization. Strenuous physical activity and sport are not recommended in asymptomatic forms. It is vital to identify those patients at high risk of sudden death (family history of sudden death, 48 to 72 hour Holter monitoring). In the absence of silent arrhythmias, preventive therapy should be more general in patients under 30 years of age. Despite a better understanding of the disease, the indications of medical and surgical treatment remain controversial and poorly defined. Treatment is mainly medical with Propranolol as the drug of choice. The dosage has to be tailored for each individual patient.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Document 2 (Title: Case management (US healthcare system)): By identifying patients with potentially catastrophic illnesses, contacting them and actively coordinating their care, plans can reduce expenses and improve the medical care they receive. Examples include identifying high-risk pregnancies in order to ensure appropriate pre-natal care and watching for dialysis claims to identify patients who are at risk of end-stage renal disease. The amount of involvement an insurer can have in managing high cost cases depends on the structure of the benefit plan. In a tightly managed plan case management may be integral to the benefits program. In less tightly managed plan, participation in a case management program is often voluntary for patients. Health care provider Case managers working for health care providers typically do the following:
Document 3 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): The expansion of knowledge related to genetics is changing our understanding of pathophysiology and influencing our classification of diseases. Awareness of genetic etiology can have an impact on clinical management, including prevention and screening for or treatment of a range of diseases. Primary care physicians are relied upon to help patients navigate testing and treatment options. Consequently, they must understand the genetic basis for a large number of genetically influenced diseases, incorporate personal and family history to determine the risk for a specific mutation, and be positioned to provide counseling. Even if patients are seen by genetic specialists who assess genetic risk and coordinate testing, primary care providers should provide information to their patients regarding the indications, limitations, risks, and benefits of genetic counseling and testing. They must also be prepared to offer risk-based management following genetic risk assessment. Given the pace of
