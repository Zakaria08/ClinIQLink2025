        "content": "Adverse effects There are many types of pain management. Each have their own benefits, drawbacks, and limits. A common challenge in pain management is communication between the health care provider and the person experiencing pain. People experiencing pain may have difficulty recognizing or describing what they feel and how intense it is. Health care providers and patients may have difficulty communicating with each other about how pain responds to treatments. There is a risk in many types of pain management for the patient to take treatment that is less effective than needed or which causes other difficulties and side effects. Some treatments for pain can be harmful if overused. A goal of pain management for the patient and their health care provider is to identify the amount of treatment needed to address the pain without going beyond that limit.",

        "content": "Much controversy exists today regarding the \"salvaging\" of high-risk infants. There are many ethical concerns surrounding these children. The advancement of technology has had a profound effect on the treatment of preterm infants or infants with deformities. In this article the authors address selected ethical concerns regarding personhood, autonomy, beneficence, parental authority, quality of life, sanctity of life, and optional, obligatory, and wrong forms of treatment. The article begins with an overview of the history of infanticide as well as the history of neonatal intensive care units. Financial and legal issues are also discussed. In addition, the nurse's role in working with high-risk infants and their families is briefly explored.",
