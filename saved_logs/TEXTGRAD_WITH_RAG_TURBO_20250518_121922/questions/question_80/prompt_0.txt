Document 1 (Title: Left Ventricular False Aneurysm -- Differential Diagnosis): Left ventricular true aneurysms merit consideration as this can mimic false aneurysms (see Image. Left Ventricular Aneurysm, Ultrasound). This is a relatively frequent complication compared to false aneurysms and occurs in 10% to 35% of patients following myocardial infarction. [17] Differentiating can often be difficult pre-operatively. Unlike a false aneurysm, a true aneurysm contains all 3 layers of the myocardial wall. A true aneurysm is an abnormal left ventricular diastolic contour with systolic dyskinesia or paradoxical bulging, leading to decreased ejection fraction. True aneurysms tend to be on the anterior or apical segments, whereas false aneurysms are more common posteriorly. [9] True aneurysms are generally non-contractile and have a thinned myocardium. Upon evaluation, the neck of the true aneurysm was not seen to be narrower than the size of the cavity. These patients have a much lower risk of rupture than false aneurysms and thus can be managed medically or surgically. [18] Patients with symptoms of angina, arrhythmias, or heart failure benefit from surgical repair. During surgery, true aneurysms can be seen to collapse fully during left ventricular decompression.

Questions are highly vari-able in difficulty and are often far too detailed. Offers few illustrations.

Document 3 (Title: University of Toronto Faculty of Medicine): The Doctor of Medicine program at the University of Toronto is a 4-year MD program with a total enrollment of about 850 students. The first two years are known as the preclerkship curriculum, during which M.D. candidates acquire the basic biomedical and human anatomy knowledge. The principles of medical ethics, professionalism and medical jurisprudence are also taught in preclerkship. The final two years form the clerkship curriculum that takes place in hospitals and ambulatory clinics. The core clerkship rotations cover the essential medical specialties: surgery and internal medicine, psychiatry, pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology, family medicine, ambulatory experience, neurology, emergency medicine, anesthesia, ophthalmology, otolaryngology and dermatology. Additional rotations are devoted to elective clerkships that provide training in subdisciplines within the major specialities.

Is including a mandatory general surgery rotation essential for the effectiveness of the surgical clerkship?
