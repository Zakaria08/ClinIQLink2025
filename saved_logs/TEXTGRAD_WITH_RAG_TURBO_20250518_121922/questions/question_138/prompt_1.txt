Document 1 (Title: Genetics, Human Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) -- Biochemical): Class I and Class II molecules differ structurally. HLA Class I molecules are comprised of a polymorphic alpha chain, which is encoded by the Class I genes, and the B2 microglobulin chain, which is encoded by a gene on chromosome 15. The alpha chain is also known as the heavy chain and also has three domains: alpha 1, 2 and 3. The alpha1 and alpha2 domains contain the majority of polymorphic regions conferring HLA antigen specificity. HLA Class II molecules have one alpha chain and a beta chain. [3] [9] Class II region contains DR, DQ, and DP. Each class II molecule has two genes, A and B encoding the alpha and beta chains. [9] [10]
Document 2 (Title: Recognition of cluster of differentiation 1 antigens by human CD4-CD8-cytolytic T lymphocytes.): Human cluster-of-differentiation 1 (CD1) is a family of cell surface glycoproteins of unknown function expressed on immature thymocytes, epidermal Langerhans cells and a subset of B lymphocytes. Three homologous proteins, CD1a, b and c, have been defined serologically, and the CD1 gene locus on human chromosome 1 contains five potential CD1 genes. Analysis of the predicted amino-acid sequences of CD1 molecules reveals a low but significant level of homology to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and class II molecules, and, like MHC class I molecules, CD1 molecules are associated non-covalently with beta 2-microglobulin. These structural similarities to known antigen-presenting molecules, together with the expression of CD1 on cells capable of antigen presentation, suggest a role for CD1 molecules in antigen recognition by T cells. Here we demonstrate the specific recognition of CD1a by a CD4-CD8- alpha beta T-cell receptor (TCR) expressing cytolytic T lymphocyte (CTL) line and the specific recognition of CD1c by a CD4-CD8- gamma delta TCR CTL line. The interaction of CD1-specific CTLs with CD1+ target cells appeared to involve the CD3-TCR complex, and did not show evidence of MHC restriction. These results suggest that for a subset of T cells, CD1 molecules serve a function analogous to that of MHC class I and II molecules.
Document 3 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): The HLA class II region is also illustrated in Fig. 373e-1. Multiple class II genes are arrayed within the centromeric 1 Mb of the HLA region, forming distinct haplotypes. A haplotype refers to an array of alleles at polymorphic loci along a chromosomal segment. Multiple class II genes are present on a single haplotype, clustered into three major subregions: HLA-DR, -DQ, and -DP. Each of these subregions contains at least one functional alpha (A) locus and one functional beta (B) locus. Together these encode proteins that form the α and β polypeptide chains of a mature class II HLA molecule. Thus, the DRA and DRB genes encode an HLA-DR molecule; DQA and DQB genes encode HLA-DQ molecules; and DPA and DPB genes encode HLA-DP molecules. There are several DRB genes (DRB1, DRB2, DRB3, etc.), so that two expressed DR molecules are encoded on most haplotypes by combining the α-chain product of the DRA gene with separate β chains. More than 1000 alleles have been identified at the HLA-DRB1

Identify the accurate statement(s) regarding Class II histocompatibility molecules:

Options:
1. Are encoded by genes present at the HLA-A, -B and -C loci
2. Are expressed on B lymphocytes and monocyte macrophages
3. Are formed by an alpha chain associated with beta-2 microglobulin
4. Have CD4 molecule as a ligand
5. Are involved in antigen presentation
