== Original Prompt ==
Question: Select the correct statement(s): Class II histocompatibility molecules:
Options:
1. Are encoded by genes present at the HLA-A, -B and -C loci
2. Are expressed on B lymphocytes and monocyte macrophages
3. Are formed by an alpha chain associated with beta-2 microglobulin
4. Have CD4 molecule as a ligand
5. Are involved in antigen presentation

Respond strictly in valid JSON format as shown below:
{"answer": ["1", "3"]} ← if options 1 and 3 are correct
Only output the JSON object. Do not include explanations, labels, markdown, or any other text.

== Answer ==
{
    "answer": ["2", "5"]
}

== Feedback ==
Incorrect answer: The answer incorrectly includes option "5" and omits option "4"; the prompt should clarify the specific roles and ligands of Class II histocompatibility molecules to guide correct selection.
