        "title": "Recognition of cluster of differentiation 1 antigens by human CD4-CD8-cytolytic T lymphocytes.",
        "content": "Human cluster-of-differentiation 1 (CD1) is a family of cell surface glycoproteins of unknown function expressed on immature thymocytes, epidermal Langerhans cells and a subset of B lymphocytes. Three homologous proteins, CD1a, b and c, have been defined serologically, and the CD1 gene locus on human chromosome 1 contains five potential CD1 genes. Analysis of the predicted amino-acid sequences of CD1 molecules reveals a low but significant level of homology to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and class II molecules, and, like MHC class I molecules, CD1 molecules are associated non-covalently with beta 2-microglobulin. These structural similarities to known antigen-presenting molecules, together with the expression of CD1 on cells capable of antigen presentation, suggest a role for CD1 molecules in antigen recognition by T cells. Here we demonstrate the specific recognition of CD1a by a CD4-CD8- alpha beta T-cell receptor (TCR) expressing cytolytic T lymphocyte (CTL) line and the specific recognition of CD1c by a CD4-CD8- gamma delta TCR CTL line. The interaction of CD1-specific CTLs with CD1+ target cells appeared to involve the CD3-TCR complex, and did not show evidence of MHC restriction. These results suggest that for a subset of T cells, CD1 molecules serve a function analogous to that of MHC class I and II molecules.",

        "content": "Class I and Class II molecules differ structurally. HLA Class I molecules are comprised of a polymorphic alpha chain, which is encoded by the Class I genes, and the B2 microglobulin chain, which is encoded by a gene on chromosome 15. The alpha chain is also known as the heavy chain and also has three domains: alpha 1, 2 and 3. The alpha1 and alpha2 domains contain the majority of polymorphic regions conferring HLA antigen specificity. HLA Class II molecules have one alpha chain and a beta chain. [3] [9] Class II region contains DR, DQ, and DP. Each class II molecule has two genes, A and B encoding the alpha and beta chains. [9] [10]",

        "content": "The HLA class II region is also illustrated in Fig. 373e-1. Multiple class II genes are arrayed within the centromeric 1 Mb of the HLA region, forming distinct haplotypes. A haplotype refers to an array of alleles at polymorphic loci along a chromosomal segment. Multiple class II genes are present on a single haplotype, clustered into three major subregions: HLA-DR, -DQ, and -DP. Each of these subregions contains at least one functional alpha (A) locus and one functional beta (B) locus. Together these encode proteins that form the \u03b1 and \u03b2 polypeptide chains of a mature class II HLA molecule. Thus, the DRA and DRB genes encode an HLA-DR molecule; DQA and DQB genes encode HLA-DQ molecules; and DPA and DPB genes encode HLA-DP molecules. There are several DRB genes (DRB1, DRB2, DRB3, etc.), so that two expressed DR molecules are encoded on most haplotypes by combining the \u03b1-chain product of the DRA gene with separate \u03b2 chains. More than 1000 alleles have been identified at the HLA-DRB1",
