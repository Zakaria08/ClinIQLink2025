Document 1 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): before it is divided. If the pancreas is not procured, a common aortic patch encompassing both the SMA and the celiac artery can be procured with the liver.Living DonorsThe maxim of medical ethics is “primum non nocere” (first, do no harm), and for that reason, living organ donation pres-ents unique ethical and legal challenges. Performing potentially harmful operations to remove organs from healthy individuals seems, at first glance, to contradict that maxim. But in fact, the ethical framework of living organ donation rests on three guid-ing principles respected in all discussions of medical practice: beneficence to the recipient, nonmaleficence to the donor, and the donor’s right to autonomy.55 In order to achieve optimal outcomes (the common good), transplant professionals should focus on maximizing the benefits for the recipient and minimiz-ing the damage to the donor. The Uniform Anatomical Gift Act adopted by all states in the United States (with slight variations) provides the
Document 2 (Title: The use of "marginal" donors for organ transplantation. The influence of donor age on outcome.): The influence of donor age on outcome was studied in the recipients of 12,131 cadaveric renal allografts, 3026 heart allografts, and 2913 liver allografts with followup information in the UNOS data base for transplants performed between 10/1/87 and 12/31/89. For recipients of kidney transplants, donors of ages 6-15 had significantly better 1-year graft survival than donors of ages 56-65, but the difference was only 7.0%. Donors of age greater than 65 actually did better than donors ages 56-65, but donors less than or equal to 5 were less satisfactory. Kidneys from older donors survived as well as kidneys from younger donors in patients with repeat transplants, diabetes, black race, age over 45, O HLA or 5 and 6 HLA matches, delayed graft function, shared kidneys and PRA greater than 50. For kidney recipients, multifactorial analysis by Cox regression showed that donor age was less important than the use of ALG, donor race, diabetes or peak PRA in ages 16-45, delayed function, repeat transplant, and HLA match. Recipients of heart transplants from donors ages 45-55 had 1-year graft survival that was 8.4% less than recipients of hearts from donors age 16-45. However, 32.7% of heart patients died during the first 12 months after listing without benefit of a transplant. Liver transplant recipients of donor ages 16-45 had 10.8% better 1-year graft survival than recipients of donors greater than 45, but a greater percentage of older donors were transplanted to high risk and older recipients. Tragically, 24.3% of patients listed for liver transplantation died within 12 months without a transplant. This analysis shows that satisfactory graft survival can be achieved using older donors and that age in itself should not be a barrier to organ donation, providing that organ function is normal and that specific disease of the organ is absent.
Document 3 (Title: Renal Transplantation Rejection -- Continuing Education Activity): Various factors merit consideration in matching the donor kidney with the recipient, as the donor kidney acts as an alloantigen. In general, when transplanting tissue or cells from a genetically different donor to the graft recipient, the alloantigen of the donor induces an immune response in the recipient against the graft. This response can destroy the graft if not controlled. The whole process is called allograft rejection. This activity describes and defines the types of rejections and the evaluation and management of this condition and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with renal transplant rejection.

Evaluate the suitability and benefits of transplanting kidneys from older donors into younger recipients, addressing medical outcomes, ethical considerations, and implications for longevity.
