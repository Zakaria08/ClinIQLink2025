The School of Veterinary Medicine at U.C. Davis initiated the Renal Transplantation Program in 1987. Cats can tolerate transplantation from unrelated cats, but must be supported with immunosuppressive drugs for the rest of their lives. When the transplanted kidney is implanted in the recipient the original kidneys are usually left in place. There are currently ten centers in the world that offer kidney transplants for cats. Most are in the US. UC Davis have since abandoned their program. Kidney transplantation is a controversial treatment option, with longevity, quality of life, as well as ethical considerations. The United Kingdom permitted this procedure in 2003, but a review in 2013 suspended it. Many argue that it causes unnecessary suffering to donor animals.",

Various factors merit consideration in matching the donor kidney with the recipient, as the donor kidney\u00a0acts as an alloantigen.\u00a0In general, when transplanting tissue or cells from a genetically different donor to the graft recipient, the alloantigen of the donor induces an immune response in the recipient against the graft. This response can destroy the graft if not controlled. The whole process is called allograft rejection. [1] Allograft rejection is inflammation with specific pathologic changes in the allograft due to the recipient\u2019s immune system recognizing the non-self antigen in the allograft, with or without dysfunction of the allograft. Both innate and adaptive immune systems play a significant role in rejection, but the T lymphocytes are the principal cells that recognize the allograft.\u00a0There are other costimulatory molecules, and cytokines also play a major role in this reaction.
