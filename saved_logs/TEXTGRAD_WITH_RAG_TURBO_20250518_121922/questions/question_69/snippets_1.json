        "title": "The pattern of rheumatic disorders seen amongst patients attending urban and rural clinics in west Africa.",
        "content": "There is a growing interest in the study of the pattern of rheumatic disorders in Africa. This has led to our studying the pattern of rheumatic disorders seen among patients attending both urban and rural clinics in West Africa. A wide spectrum of rheumatic diseases was observed among those attending both clinics. Osteoarthritis and soft tissue lesions were most commonly seen while inflammatory joint disease and connective tissue disorders were less commonly observed. We consider that these observations have significant rheumatological health care implications for West Africa and may provide useful aetiopathogenic clues.",
