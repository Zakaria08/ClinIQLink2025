Document 1 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): these pathogens account for only ~1% of deaths in this population. Cardiovascular disease and injuries are the most frequent causes of death among travelers from the United States, accounting for 49% and 22% of deaths, respectively. Age-specific rates of death due to cardiovascular disease are similar among travelers and nontravelers. In contrast, rates of death due to injury (the majority from 794 10.001% 0.0001% 0.01% 0.1% Cholera Meningococcal disease Typhoid (other areas) Legionella infection Typhoid (India, northern/ northwestern Africa, Peru) HIV infection Hepatitis B (expatriates) Hepatitis A Gonorrhea Animal bites with rabies risk Dengue infection (Southeast Asia) Acute febrile respiratory tract infection Malaria (no chemoprophylaxis, West Africa) Travelers’ diarrhea ETEC diarrhea 10% 100% 30–80% 100,000 10,000 10 100 1% 1,000 recommended (immunizations that are desirable because of travel-related risks).
Document 2 (Title: Heart rate): Correlation with cardiovascular mortality risk A number of investigations indicate that faster resting heart rate has emerged as a new risk factor for mortality in homeothermic mammals, particularly cardiovascular mortality in human beings. Faster heart rate may accompany increased production of inflammation molecules and increased production of reactive oxygen species in cardiovascular system, in addition to increased mechanical stress to the heart. There is a correlation between increased resting rate and cardiovascular risk. This is not seen to be "using an allotment of heart beats" but rather an increased risk to the system from the increased rate.
Document 3 (Title: Barriers to treatment of obstetric emergencies in rural communities of West Africa. The Prevention of Maternal Mortality Network.): This article is the result of a collaborative effort among the researchers of the Prevention of Maternal Mortality Network. The network consists of 12 multidisciplinary teams, 11 in West Africa and one based at Columbia University in New York. This article summarizes exploratory research conducted by the African teams using focus-group discussions in rural communities in Nigeria, Ghana, and Sierra Leone. The objective was to identify barriers to the use of health-care facilities when obstetric problems arise. The findings illustrate how sociocultural factors, such as societal expectations and the role of women, affect the use of health services. Physical and social distance between communities and facilities, as well as transportation problems, were found to be obstacles to care. Health-service factors were also found to pose barriers to prompt treatment. This article also provides an example of how qualitative methodology can be used to obtain substantive information about a community's frustrations and needs with respect to health care.

How relevant is resting heart rate in assessing cardiovascular risk among rural adults in West Africa?
