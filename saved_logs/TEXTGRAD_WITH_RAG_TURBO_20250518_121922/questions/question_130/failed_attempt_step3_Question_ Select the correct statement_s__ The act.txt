== Original Prompt ==
Question: Select the correct statement(s): The activation energy of an enzymatic reaction is:
Options:
1. The energy needed to activate the enzyme concerned
2. The energy needed to activate the substrate
3. The energy released during the reaction
4. The energy retained in the reaction products
5. The energy provided by the reaction products

Respond strictly in valid JSON format as shown below:
{"answer": ["1", "3"]} ← if options 1 and 3 are correct

Select the accurate statement(s) about the role of activation energy in an enzymatic reaction:

Options:
1. The energy needed to activate the enzyme concerned
2. The energy needed to activate the substrate
3. The energy released during the reaction
4. The energy retained in the reaction products
5. The energy provided by the reaction products

== Answer ==
{"answer": ["1", "3"]}

== Feedback ==
Incorrect answer: The answer incorrectly includes option "1" which is not about activation energy, and the prompt could be improved by clarifying that activation energy specifically refers to the energy required to initiate the reaction by affecting the substrate, not the enzyme itself.

== Improved Full Prompt ==
