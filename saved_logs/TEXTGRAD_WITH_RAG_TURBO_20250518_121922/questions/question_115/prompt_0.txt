With your own knowledge and the help of the following document:

Document 1 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Treatment includes gastric lavage, supportive measures, and oral administration of activated charcoal or cholestyramine to prevent absorption of residual drug. Neither charcoal nor cholestyramine appears to be effective if given >30 min after acetaminophen ingestion; if they are used, the stomach lavage should be done before other agents are administered orally. The chances of possible, probable, and high-risk hepatotoxicity can be derived from a nomogram plot (Fig. 361-2), readily available in emergency departments, as a function of measuring acetaminophen plasma levels 8 h after ingestion. In patients with high acetaminophen blood levels (>200 μg/mL measured at 4 h or >100 μg/mL at 8 h after ingestion), the administration of N-acetylcysteine reduces the severity of hepatic necrosis. This agent provides sulfhydryl donor groups to replete glutathione, which is required to render harmless toxic metabolites that would otherwise bind covalently via sulfhydryl linkages to cell proteins,
Document 2 (Title: Valproate Toxicity -- Treatment / Management): Other interventions to consider early for patients with valproate toxicity are gastrointestinal decontamination and lavage. If the patient presents within 2 hours of a valproate overdose, activated charcoal may be used for gastrointestinal decontamination. Valproate is available in enteric-coated and extended-release formulations, which have slow absorption. Administration of activated charcoal may be considered beyond 2 hours from ingestion for patients who have taken enteric-coated and extended-release valproate formulations. [25] The dose of activated charcoal is 1 g/kg of body weight. If the patient cannot swallow reliably, the administration of activated charcoal should be withheld. Gastric lavage may also be considered to eliminate valproate from the digestive tract. Food and Drug Administration guidelines indicate that gastric lavage treatment may be effective up to 10 or 12 hours after drug intake. [26]
Document 3 (Title: A comparison of the efficacy of gastric lavage, ipecacuanha and activated charcoal in the emergency management of paracetamol overdose.): The aim of this prospective trial was to compare the efficacy of gastric lavage, activated charcoal and ipecacuanha at limiting the absorption of paracetamol in overdose and to assess the significance of the continued absorption of paracetamol following treatment. Patients aged 16 and over who had ingested 5 gms or more of paracetamol within 4h of admission were entered into the trial. The percentage fall in plasma paracetamol level was used as the measure of the success of a treatment at limiting absorption. The mean percentage fall was 39.3 for gastric lavage, 52.2 for activated charcoal and 40.7 for ipecacuanha, with a significant difference between the treatment methods (p = 0.03). Activated charcoal was more effective at limiting the absorption of paracetamol following overdose than either gastric lavage or ipecacuanha induced emesis. In treated patients continuing paracetamol absorption is not significant if more than 2h have elapsed since ingestion.

Identify the accurate statement(s) concerning the effects and management of paracetamol poisoning:

Options:
1. Early administration of activated charcoal decreases the bioavailability of paracetamol
2. N-acetylcysteine used orally, in combination with activated charcoal, loses its detoxifying activity
3. Acute tubular nephropathy constitutes an early sign of intoxication
4. Early gastric lavage constitutes an essential therapeutic measure
5. The toxifying metabolic pathway uses cytochrome P450
