With your own knowledge and the help of the following document:

Document 1 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Treatment includes gastric lavage, supportive measures, and oral administration of activated charcoal or cholestyramine to prevent absorption of residual drug. Neither charcoal nor cholestyramine appears to be effective if given >30 min after acetaminophen ingestion; if they are used, the stomach lavage should be done before other agents are administered orally. The chances of possible, probable, and high-risk hepatotoxicity can be derived from a nomogram plot (Fig. 361-2), readily available in emergency departments, as a function of measuring acetaminophen plasma levels 8 h after ingestion. In patients with high acetaminophen blood levels (>200 μg/mL measured at 4 h or >100 μg/mL at 8 h after ingestion), the administration of N-acetylcysteine reduces the severity of hepatic necrosis. This agent provides sulfhydryl donor groups to replete glutathione, which is required to render harmless toxic metabolites that would otherwise bind covalently via sulfhydryl linkages to cell proteins,
Document 2 (Title: Valproate Toxicity -- Treatment / Management): Other interventions to consider early for patients with valproate toxicity are gastrointestinal decontamination and lavage. If the patient presents within 2 hours of a valproate overdose, activated charcoal may be used for gastrointestinal decontamination. Valproate is available in enteric-coated and extended-release formulations, which have slow absorption. Administration of activated charcoal may be considered beyond 2 hours from ingestion for patients who have taken enteric-coated and extended-release valproate formulations. [25] The dose of activated charcoal is 1 g/kg of body weight. If the patient cannot swallow reliably, the administration of activated charcoal should be withheld. Gastric lavage may also be considered to eliminate valproate from the digestive tract. Food and Drug Administration guidelines indicate that gastric lavage treatment may be effective up to 10 or 12 hours after drug intake. [26]
Document 3 (Title: Clinical pharmacokinetics of N-acetylcysteine.): N-Acetylcysteine is useful as a mucolytic agent for treatment of chronic bronchitis and other pulmonary diseases complicated by the production of viscous mucus. It is also used as an antidote to paracetamol (acetaminophen) poisoning and found to be effective for the prevention of cardiotoxicity by doxorubicin and haemorrhagic cystitis from oxazaphosphorines. After an oral dose of N-acetylcysteine 200 to 400 mg the peak plasma concentration of 0.35 to 4 mg/L is achieved within 1 to 2 hours. Although the data are conflicting, it appears that the administration of charcoal may interfere with drug absorption, with up to 96% of the drug adsorbed on to the charcoal. Information on absorption in the presence of food or other drugs is not available. The volume of distribution ranges from 0.33 to 0.47 L/kg and protein binding is significant, reaching approximately 50% 4 hours after the dose. Pharmacokinetic information is not available as to whether or not N-acetylcysteine crosses the blood-brain barrier or placenta, or into breast milk. Renal clearance has been reported as 0.190 to 0.211 L/h/kg and approximately 70% of the total body clearance is nonrenal. Following oral administration, reduced N-acetylcysteine has a terminal half-life of 6.25h. Little is known of the metabolism of this agent, although it is believed to be rapidly metabolised and incorporated on to proteins. The major excretory product is inorganic sulphate. Frequently reported side effects are nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Biochemical and haematological adverse effects are observed but are not clinically relevant. Drug interactions of clinical significance have been observed with paracetamol, glutathione and anticancer agents.

Please provide detailed and accurate information on the causes, effects, and management strategies associated with paracetamol poisoning.

Options:
1. Early administration of activated charcoal decreases the bioavailability of paracetamol
2. N-acetylcysteine used orally, in combination with activated charcoal, loses its detoxifying activity
3. Acute tubular nephropathy constitutes an early sign of intoxication
4. Early gastric lavage constitutes an essential therapeutic measure
5. The toxifying metabolic pathway uses cytochrome P450
