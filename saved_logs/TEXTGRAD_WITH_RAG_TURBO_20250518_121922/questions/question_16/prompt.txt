Document 1 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): Helge Eilers, MD, & Spencer Yost, MD An elderly man with type 2 diabetes mellitus and ischemic pain in the lower extremity is scheduled for femoral-to-popliteal artery bypass surgery. He has a history of hyper-tension and coronary artery disease with symptoms of stable angina. He can walk only half a block before pain in his legs forces him to stop. He has a 50-pack-year smoking history but stopped 2 years ago. Medications include atenolol, atorvastatin, and hydrochlorothiazide. The nurse in the preoperative holding area obtains the following vital signs: temperature 36.8°C (98.2°F), blood pressure 168/100 mm Hg, heart rate 78 bpm, oxygen saturation by pulse oximeter 96% while breathing room air, and pain 5/10 in the right lower leg after walking into the hospital. What anesthetic agents will you choose for his anesthetic plan? Why? Does the choice of anesthetic make a difference?
Document 2 (Title: Peripheral artery disease): Signs and symptoms The signs and symptoms of peripheral artery disease are based on the part of the body that is affected. About 66% of patients affected by PAD either do not have symptoms or have atypical symptoms. The most common presenting symptom is intermittent claudication, which causes pain and severe cramping when walking or exercising. The pain is usually located in the calf muscles of the affected leg and relieved by rest. This occurs because during exercise the muscles of the leg need more oxygen. Normally, the arteries would be able to increase the amount of blood flow and therefore increase the amount of oxygen going to the exercised leg. However, in PAD, the artery is unable to respond appropriately to the increased demand for oxygen by the muscles, as a result, the leg muscles are overly saturated with lactic acid, resulting in pain of the muscle that only goes away with rest. Other symptoms may include
Document 3 (Title: Case Study: 32-Year-Old Male Presenting with Right Lower Quadrant Abdominal Pain (Archived) -- Case Presentation): The patient denies prior abdominal surgeries. He does smoke a half pack of cigarettes a day, drinks alcohol socially, and denies any recreational drug use. He notes no inherited medical conditions in his family. Vital signs on arrival: Blood pressure (BP) 120/73 Heart rate (HR) 60 RR 18 Temperature: 35.6 C Oxygen saturation: 98% on room air Height 5'10" (178 cm) Weight 154 lbs (70 kg)
Document 4 (Title: Post-polio syndrome: a review and case report.): A 21-year-old Thai man presented with progressive weakness and atrophy of both hands for 2 years. His left leg was atrophic and weak secondary to poliomyelitis since he was 8 months old. Physical examination showed that there was atrophy of both hands and forearms as well as left leg. Sensation was normal. Deep tendon reflexes were normal except for hyporeflexia of left leg. EMG showed chronic denervation pattern in the recent atrophic muscles and in normal power muscles. Motor and sensory nerve conductions were normal. Biopsy of forearm muscle revealed degeneration and fibrosis of muscle fibers. These findings were compatible with post-polio syndrome (PPS) which presents in patients with late paralysis following poliomyelitis. It is not a form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis although some clinical similarities exist. Weakness from PPS may lead to musculoskeletal pain and increased functional disability. Proper rehabilitation program is to maintain his functional status and allow him to continue to live as independently as possible by regular exercise without stressing joints and muscles.
Document 5 (Title: Case Study: 86-Year-Old Male With Leg Swelling After Hip Surgery (Archived) -- Case Presentation): An 86-year-old male was noted to have left lower extremity swelling after an uneventful left hip surgery performed for a fracture after a fall down a stairwell two months prior. His other medical co-morbidities include hypertension, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and hyperlipidemia. He denied shortness of breath, prior leg swelling, pain at rest, or foot discoloration.

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
Question: A 68-year-old man presents to the emergency department with leg pain. He states that the pain started suddenly while he was walking outside. The patient has a past medical history of diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and atrial fibrillation. His temperature is 99.3°F (37.4°C), blood pressure is 152/98 mmHg, pulse is 97/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. Physical exam is notable for a cold and pale left leg. The patient’s sensation is markedly diminished in the left leg when compared to the right, and his muscle strength is 1/5 in his left leg. Which of the following is the best next step in management?
Options:
A. Graded exercise and aspirin
B. Heparin drip
C. Surgical thrombectomy
D. Tissue plasminogen activator
