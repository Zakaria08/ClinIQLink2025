        "content": "Despite technological advances, pulmonary hypertension detection still takes more than 2 years from symptom onset, thus requiring a high index of suspicion. [26] [27]  Patients with unexplained shortness of breath or symptoms concerning for pulmonary hypertension should be thoroughly assessed. The evaluation process should include a comprehensive medical and family history, physical examination, monitoring of blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation, and blood tests, including brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal pro-BNP (NT-proBNP) and resting electrocardiogram (ECG). These initial steps help raise suspicion of a cardiopulmonary illness. The next step in the workup involves cardiac assessment with echocardiography. Signs indicative of pulmonary dysfunction warrant pulmonary function tests (PFTs), chest imaging\u00a0modalities like x-ray\u00a0and computed tomography (CT), and, in some instances, cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET).",

        "content": "Adverse effects Generally, levosalbutamol is well tolerated. Common mild side-effects include an elevated heart rate, muscle cramps, and gastric upset (including heartburn and diarrhea). Symptoms of overdose in particular include: collapse into a seizure; chest pain (possible precursor of a heart attack); fast, pounding heartbeat, which may cause raised blood pressure (hypertension); irregular heartbeat (cardiac arrhythmia), which may cause paradoxical lowered blood pressure (hypotension); nervousness and tremor; headache; dizziness and nausea/vomiting; weakness or exhaustion (medical fatigue); dry mouth; and insomnia. Rarer side effects may indicate a dangerous allergic reaction. These include: paradoxical bronchospasm (shortness of breath and difficulty breathing); skin itching, rash, or hives (urticaria); swelling (angioedema) of any part of the face or throat (which can lead to voice hoarseness), or swelling of the extremities.
