Document 1 (Title: Pulmonary Hypertension -- Evaluation -- Basic Concepts in Pulmonary Hypertension Evaluation): Despite technological advances, pulmonary hypertension detection still takes more than 2 years from symptom onset, thus requiring a high index of suspicion. [26] [27]  Patients with unexplained shortness of breath or symptoms concerning for pulmonary hypertension should be thoroughly assessed. The evaluation process should include a comprehensive medical and family history, physical examination, monitoring of blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation, and blood tests, including brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal pro-BNP (NT-proBNP) and resting electrocardiogram (ECG). These initial steps help raise suspicion of a cardiopulmonary illness. The next step in the workup involves cardiac assessment with echocardiography. Signs indicative of pulmonary dysfunction warrant pulmonary function tests (PFTs), chest imaging modalities like x-ray and computed tomography (CT), and, in some instances, cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET).
Document 2 (Title: Levosalbutamol): Adverse effects Generally, levosalbutamol is well tolerated. Common mild side-effects include an elevated heart rate, muscle cramps, and gastric upset (including heartburn and diarrhea). Symptoms of overdose in particular include: collapse into a seizure; chest pain (possible precursor of a heart attack); fast, pounding heartbeat, which may cause raised blood pressure (hypertension); irregular heartbeat (cardiac arrhythmia), which may cause paradoxical lowered blood pressure (hypotension); nervousness and tremor; headache; dizziness and nausea/vomiting; weakness or exhaustion (medical fatigue); dry mouth; and insomnia. Rarer side effects may indicate a dangerous allergic reaction. These include: paradoxical bronchospasm (shortness of breath and difficulty breathing); skin itching, rash, or hives (urticaria); swelling (angioedema) of any part of the face or throat (which can lead to voice hoarseness), or swelling of the extremities.

Document 3 (Title: Biochemistry_Lippinco): .5. A 67-year-old man presented to the emergency department with a 1-week history of angina and shortness of breath. He complained that his face and extremities had taken on a blue color. His medical history included chronic stable angina treated with isosorbide dinitrate and nitroglycerin. Blood obtained for analysis was brown. Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis? A. Carboxyhemoglobinemia B. Hemoglobin SC disease C. Methemoglobinemia D. Sickle cell anemia E. β-Thalassemia

A 68-year-old man arrives at the emergency department displaying symptoms of chest pain, shortness of breath, and sweating. His medical history includes hypertension and type 2 diabetes. Initial examination reveals elevated blood pressure and an irregular heartbeat. After performing an ECG and obtaining lab results showing increased cardiac enzymes, what is the best next step in his management?

Options:
A. Graded exercise and aspirin
B. Heparin drip
C. Surgical thrombectomy
D. Tissue plasminogen activator
