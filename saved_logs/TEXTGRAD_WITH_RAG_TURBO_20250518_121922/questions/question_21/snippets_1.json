        "content": "Other risk factors include obesity and being female. Diagnosis Diagnosis is first suspected clinically based on history and physical exam and usually confirmed by an MRI scan or CT scan, depending on availability. Bladder scanning and loss of catheter sensation can also be used to evaluate bladder dysfunction in suspected cases of cauda equina syndrome and can aid diagnosis before MRI scanning. Early surgery in acute onset of severe cases has been reported to be important. Prevention Early diagnosis of cauda equina syndrome can allow for preventive treatment. Signs that allow early diagnosis include changes in bowel and bladder function and loss of feeling in groin. Changes in sensation can start as pins and needles leading to numbness. Changes in bladder function may be changes to stream or inability to fully empty the bladder. If a person progresses to full retention intervention is less likely to be successful.",

        "content": "We encountered a patient with acute cauda equina syndrome. The clinical course, laboratory data and imaging study, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) strongly suggested that this episode was caused by a vascular disorder of the conus medullaris. We emphasized the diagnostic usefulness of MRI in the vascular disease of the conus medullaris as well as the clinical importance of this disease in the differential diagnosis of acute cauda equina syndrome.",

Cauda equina syndrome is classed as a surgical emergency to prevent permanent and irreversible damage to the compressed nerve roots. A 45-year-old man was involved in a serious car accident. On examination he had a severe injury to the cervical region of his vertebral column with damage to the spinal cord. In fact, his breathing became erratic and stopped.",
