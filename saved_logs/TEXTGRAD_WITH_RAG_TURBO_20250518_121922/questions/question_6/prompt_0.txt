Document 1 (Title: Acne Vulgaris -- Treatment / Management -- Oral Hormonal Therapies): Oral hormonal therapies, such as oral contraceptives and spironolactone, are effective options for female patients seeking acne treatment. These therapies reduce the action of androgens on pilosebaceous units, which in turn decreases sebum production and helps alleviate acne symptoms. Hormonal therapy is an appropriate treatment option for various groups of females, including postmenarchal women dealing with severe acne vulgaris, women experiencing acne related to hyperandrogenism, and women with milder acne seeking contraception. [41] The treatment regimens for using oral contraceptives to manage acne vulgaris are similar to those used for contraception. However, only 3 oral contraceptives have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating acne. These include ethinyl estradiol 20/30/35 mcg/norethindrone 1 mg, ethinyl estradiol 35 mcg/norgestimate 180/215/250 mcg, and ethinyl estradiol 20 mcg/drospirenone 3 mg. On the other hand, progestin-only contraceptives, which include low-dose oral pills containing androgenic progestins (such as norethindrone or desogestrel), are not considered effective and may exacerbate acne vulgaris. Treatment with oral contraceptives should be avoided in patients with underlying thrombophilic disorders or those having a history of thromboembolic events. [42]
Document 2 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Identification of the offending scorpion helps to determine the course of treatment. Stings of nonlethal species require at most ice packs, analgesics, or antihistamines. Because most victims experience only local discomfort, they can be managed at home with instructions to return to the emergency department if signs of cranial-nerve or neuromuscular dysfunction develop. Aggressive supportive care and judicious use of antivenom can reduce or eliminate deaths from more severe envenomations. Keeping the patient calm and applying pressure dressings and cold packs to the sting site are measures that decrease the absorption of venom. A continuous IV infusion of midazolam controls the agitation, flailing, and involuntary muscle movements produced by scorpion stings. Close monitoring during treatment with this drug and other sedatives or narcotics is necessary for persons with neuromuscular symptoms because of the risk of respiratory arrest. Hypertension and pulmonary edema respond to
Document 3 (Title: A case of panic disorder induced by oral contraceptive.): A 27-year-old woman experienced feelings of unreality and fear after taking an oral contraceptive in the form of birth control pills. She subsequently experienced a panic attack just after she had stopped taking the pills. This was characterized by palpitation, general fatigue, trembling of the whole body, and dyspnea. The panic disorder experienced by the patient could have been due to the drug's potentiating of the sympathoadrenal response to simple physiological stimuli, or possibly to a disorder in psychological functioning caused by an anxiotropic effect of rapid endocrinological change.
