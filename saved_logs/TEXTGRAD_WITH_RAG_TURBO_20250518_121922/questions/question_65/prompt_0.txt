Document 1 (Title: [What is the role of nutrition in Crohn disease? A contribution to the importance of dietary therapy in regional enteritis].): The clinical appearance of Crohn's disease (CD) is especially marked by nutritional deficits and insufficiencies. For a long time the goal of nutritional care was reduced to the readjustment of the nutritional status. The development and clinical use of controlled parenteral nutrition (TPN) and enteral nutritive solutions (EN) did not only emphasize this therapeutical issue, but furthermore showed positive effects on the conservative as well as on the surgical treatment concepts. Therefore today artificial nutritional support is a firm part of therapy in acute, active phases or in the contact of surgical management of CD. This is especially valid in children, where complications in general and growth failure in particular can be reduced. EN is the preferred feeding method in most of the cases, due to a lower complication rate and reduced cost when compared to TPN. The question regarding the importance of nutritional support as primary therapy has also been investigated. The results differ extensively, but point towards the conclusion that patients with solitary small bowel disease do profit from this therapeutical concept. Nevertheless it is unclear, how TPN or EN interfere in the pathophysiology or -biochemistry in this process. A question about reduction e.g. of allergic components of daily diet did stimulate new theories regarding the hypothesis of a possible causal relationship between diet and the pathogenesis of CD. Investigations on dietary habits and daily dietary therapy did not reveal an overall accepted dietary guideline. Nevertheless it seems obvious that dietary counselling has a positive effect on the disease process. It does appear, that today in the acute, active phase as well as in the long term management of Crohn's disease nutritional-care is an important therapeutical method.
Document 2 (Title: Malignant Pleural Effusion -- Treatment / Management -- Palliative symptom-directed management of dyspnea in advanced cancer): Supplemental oxygen (palliative oxygen therapy) is indicated in patients with chronic severe hypoxemia (partial pressure of oxygen or PaO2 <7.3 kPa, corresponding to an oxygen saturation level >88%). [236] Evidence from clinical trials does not support using benzodiazepines for the relief of breathlessness. These medications are not advised as first-line interventions. [237] Benzodiazepines may be used to alleviate anxiety associated with air hunger as second or third-line treatments when opioids are not effective. Steroids have been advised to manage breathlessness refractory to other treatment options. [238]
Document 3 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): limited, a range of options usually exists with respect to withdrawing or with-holding treatment, allowing for an incremental approach, for example (a) continuing the current regimen without adding new interventions or tests; (b) continuing the current regimen but withdrawing elements when they are no longer beneficial; and (c) withdrawing and withholding all treatments that are not tar-geted to relieve symptoms and maximize patient comfort.34The surgeon might consider discussing the clinical situ-ation with the patient or proxy decision maker, identify the various therapeutic options, and delineate the reasons why with-holding or withdrawing life-sustaining therapy would be in the patient’s best interest. If the patient (or designated proxy deci-sion maker) does not agree with withholding or withdrawing life-sustaining therapy, the surgeon should consider involving consultants who have participated in the patient’s care, experts in palliative or end-of-life care or recommend a second

Evaluate the effectiveness and potential benefits of patient-controlled opioid therapy for managing breathlessness in palliative care. How does this approach compare to traditional methods, and can it be considered a new therapeutic concept?
