Document 1 (Title: Cancer and Leukemia Group B): Function CALGB Research Objectives To answer important therapeutic questions through large clinical trials To develop a strong multidisciplinary approach to cancer treatment and prevention To integrate information obtained from basic science and from economic and psychosocial investigations with information from clinical trials To explore the relationship between dose density and therapeutic outcome To systematically explore methods of optimizing treatment for individual patients To introduce novel therapies and treatment approaches for patients with poor prognoses To study quality of life and impact of cost on cancer patients To encourage fresh and innovative ideas of new investigators To involve community hospitals in CALGB cancer research To maintain a high degree of quality control in all CALGB science To increase participation of minority populations, the elderly and women in clinical trials To collect, analyze, and publish the results of CALGB studies
Document 2 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): antifibrotic Therapy Because widespread tissue fibrosis in SSc causes progressive organ damage, drugs that interfere with the fibrotic process represent a rational therapeutic approach. D-Penicillamine has been extensively used as an antifibrotic agent. In retrospective studies, D-penicillamine stabilized and improved skin induration, prevented new internal organ involvement, and improved survival. However, a randomized controlled clinical trial in early active SSc found no difference in the extent of skin involvement between patients treated with standard-dose (750 mg/d) or very low-dose (125 mg every other day) D-penicillamine. Recent clinical trials show benefit of pirfenidone and of nintedanib in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, with significant slowing of the loss of lung function. Whether these two new drugs will have comparable efficacy in the treatment of SSc-associated lung disease is still under investigation.
Document 3 (Title: Codeine -- Indications -- FDA-Approved Indications): The most prevalent causes of non-cancer chronic pain include back pain, fibromyalgia, osteoarthritis, and headache. The drug's use in the management of acute pain likewise remains contentious, as evidenced by the inconclusive or equivocal findings in several recent randomized controlled trials when compared to common non-opioid OTC medications [5] [6] [1] Care is needed when prescribing codeine. [7] This includes the following: Before initiating codeine therapy, clinicians must perform a history, physical examination, and essential testing, including assessing the risk of substance addiction, misuse, or abuse. Clinicians must consider codeine as an option if the pain has a deleterious effect on the quality of life and the benefits of the therapy outweigh the potential risks. The clinicians and patients must discuss initial treatment with codeine as a therapeutic trial to determine whether the therapy is appropriate.

Analyze the effectiveness, benefits, and risks of patient-controlled opioid therapy methods, and assess whether it represents a new therapeutic concept. Consider treatment outcomes, patient safety, and potential for addiction. What insights can be drawn from recent studies and clinical trials?
