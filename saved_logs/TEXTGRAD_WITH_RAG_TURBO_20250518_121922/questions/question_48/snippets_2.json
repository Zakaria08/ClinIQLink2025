        "content": "Other masses may arise from the persistence of the thyroglossal duct, such as thyroglossal duct cyst carcinomas, which are more prevalent in women within the age range of 20 to 50 years old. The exact etiology behind these carcinomas is not well understood, and even though they are very well associated with various types of thyroid cancer, they account for less than 1% of the cases. The most common form of cancer associated with thyroglossal duct cyst carcinoma is the thyroid papillary carcinoma, which is present in 85% of the cases. Following the papillary thyroid carcinoma, histologically speaking, the most common cancers associated with thyroglossal duct cyst carcinoma are the squamous cell carcinoma, follicular cell carcinoma, anaplastic carcinoma, epidermoid carcinoma, and Hurthle cell carcinoma.",

        "content": "Primary carcinoma of the thyroglossal duct is rare. This discussion reports two cases and reviews the 50 previously reported in the literature. The criteria for diagnosis include evidence of a thyroglossal duct remnant and a normal thyroid gland. The differentiation from cystic metastases to lymph nodes is pointed out. The histologic types parallel those of carcinoma of the thyroid gland, papillary carcinoma being the most common and having a generally favorable prognosis. The clinical presentation of these tumors is similar to that with benign cysts and thus is of limited value in the diagnosis.",
