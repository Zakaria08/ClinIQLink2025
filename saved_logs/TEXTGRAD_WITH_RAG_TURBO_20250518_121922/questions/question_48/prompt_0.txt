Document 1 (Title: Persistent thyroglossal duct): Once the thyroglossal duct involutes, the cells will begin to degenerate and disappear. However, in the case of a persistent thyroglossal duct, the tube remains hollow and continues to connect the foramen cecum to the thyroid gland. Histology The cells of the thyroglossal duct are epithelial in origin. The cell shapes can range from columnar, to squamous, to transitional epithelium. Thyroid-like masses can also be seen in close relation along the duct. Enclosed vesicles and cysts can also be seen while studying the tissue of the duct. A persistent thyroglossal duct in a rabbit showed resemblance to the layout of the alimentary canal; with its external fibrous connective tissue, muscular layers, submucosal glands, and convoluted epithelium. Diagnosis Ultrasound is the often chosen to examine the duct and determine the presence and size of any cysts or abnormalities. Fine-needle aspiration cytology can also be used to confirm the diagnosis.
Document 2 (Title: Anatomy, Head and Neck, Thyroid Thyroglossal Duct -- Clinical Significance): Other masses may arise from the persistence of the thyroglossal duct, such as thyroglossal duct cyst carcinomas, which are more prevalent in women within the age range of 20 to 50 years old. The exact etiology behind these carcinomas is not well understood, and even though they are very well associated with various types of thyroid cancer, they account for less than 1% of the cases. The most common form of cancer associated with thyroglossal duct cyst carcinoma is the thyroid papillary carcinoma, which is present in 85% of the cases. Following the papillary thyroid carcinoma, histologically speaking, the most common cancers associated with thyroglossal duct cyst carcinoma are the squamous cell carcinoma, follicular cell carcinoma, anaplastic carcinoma, epidermoid carcinoma, and Hurthle cell carcinoma.
Document 3 (Title: Carcinoma of the thyroglossal duct.): A review of 39 instances of excision of a cyst of the thyroglossal duct performed at St. Paul Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, revealed two patients with carcinoma of the thyroglossal duct. A review of the English literature yielded 146 instances of this uncommon tumor. Eighty-four per cent were papillary adenocarcinoma of thyroid type and 5 per cent were squamous cell carcinoma. The patients were from six to 81 years old with a 2:1 female to male ratio. Metastatic disease to lymph nodes was noted in 11 per cent and invasion of overlying strap muscles was found in 4 per cent. Carcinoma of the thyroid gland occurred in 14 per cent. Preoperative diagnosis was rare. The Sistrunk procedure is recommended for initial surgical therapy with further surgical or adjuvant therapy dependent on associated clinical findings. Prognosis for carcinoma of the thyroglossal duct of thyroid type parallels that of carcinoma of the thyroid gland.
