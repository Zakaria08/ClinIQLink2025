        "title": "Primary papillary carcinoma of a thyroglossal duct cyst: report of a case and literature review.",
        "content": "Thyroglossal duct cysts are the most common anomaly in thyroid development. They are twice as frequent as branchial cleft abnormalities and, in children, are second only to enlarged cervical lymph nodes as the cause of neck mass. Generally, duct cysts are benign, but 1 per cent of cases may be malignant. From the world literature, 114 cases of malignant thyroglossal cysts were available for review. With the addition of our own case, we discuss 115 instances of duct cysts. The different types of neoplasia described included thyroid papillary carcinoma in 81.7 per cent, mixed papillary-follicular carcinoma in 6.9 per cent, squamous cell carcinoma in 5.2 per cent, follicular and adenocarcinoma in 1.7 per cent each, and malignant struma, epidermoid carcinoma and anaplastic carcinoma in 0.9 per cent each. Of the 115 cases surveyed, 35 thyroid glands were examined microscopically; of these, four (11.4 per cent) contained malignant foci. Whether these are primary malignancies of the thyroglossal duct cysts or metastases is discussed.",

        "content": "Other masses may arise from the persistence of the thyroglossal duct, such as thyroglossal duct cyst carcinomas, which are more prevalent in women within the age range of 20 to 50 years old. The exact etiology behind these carcinomas is not well understood, and even though they are very well associated with various types of thyroid cancer, they account for less than 1% of the cases. The most common form of cancer associated with thyroglossal duct cyst carcinoma is the thyroid papillary carcinoma, which is present in 85% of the cases. Following the papillary thyroid carcinoma, histologically speaking, the most common cancers associated with thyroglossal duct cyst carcinoma are the squamous cell carcinoma, follicular cell carcinoma, anaplastic carcinoma, epidermoid carcinoma, and Hurthle cell carcinoma.",

        "title": "Thyroglossal cyst",
        "content": "The persistent duct or sinus can promote oral secretions, which may cause cysts to become infected. Up to half of thyroglossal cysts are not diagnosed until adult life. The tract can lie dormant for years or even decades, until some kind of stimulus leads to cystic dilation. Infection can sometimes cause the transient appearance of a mass or enlargement of the cyst, at times with periodic recurrences. Spontaneous drainage may also occur. Differential diagnosis are ectopic thyroid, enlarged lymph nodes, dermoid cysts and goiter. Thyroglossal cyst usually presents as a midline neck lump (in the region of the hyoid bone) that is usually painless, smooth and cystic, though if infected, pain can occur. There may be difficulty breathing, dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), or dyspepsia (discomfort in the upper abdomen), especially if the cyst becomes large.",
