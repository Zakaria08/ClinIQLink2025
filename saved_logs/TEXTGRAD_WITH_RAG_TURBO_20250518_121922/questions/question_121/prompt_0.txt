Document 1 (Title: The permeation of organic acids through lecithin bilayers. Resemblance to diffusion in polymers.): 1. The fluxes of aliphatic acids and their derivatives through black lipid membranes made of egg lecithin in decane were measured by means of a proton titration method. 2. Permeability coefficients were calculated and these were divided by the partition coefficient of the diffusing solute in different solvent systems: n-decane, olive oil, ether and octanol. The logarithms of the diffusion coefficients thus obtained were plotted against the logarithm of the molecular weight. The data could not be fitted to a single regression line in any solvent system. 3. When the logarithm of the diffusion coefficients were correlated to the logarithm of the molecular volume (equals molecular weight/ specific gravity) all the diffusants could be fitted to the same regression line, indicating that the molecular volume is a better index of molecular size and shape than the molecular weight. 4. Analysis of the experimental results assuming a model of diffusion through soft polymers (Lieb, W.R. and Stein, W. D. (1971) Current Topics in Membranes and Transport, vol. 2, pp. 1-39, Academic Press, New York) showed that decane and olive oil are not adequate model solvents for planar lecithin membranes but ether and octanol are good models. 5. The differential mass selectivity coefficient was found to be similar to that for soft polymers and biological membranes, i.e. greater than 3.0. 6. Water could be fitted by the same regression line, thus emphasizing the generality of passive transfer and implying that water crosses lipid membranes as single molecules.
Document 2 (Title: Physiology, Osmosis -- Introduction): Osmosis, Greek for push, is the net movement of water across a semipermeable membrane (see Figure. Osmosis). [1] [2] Across this membrane, water tends to move from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration. It is important to emphasize that ideal osmosis requires only the movement of pure water across the membrane without any movement of solute particles across the semipermeable membrane. Osmosis can still occur with some permeability of solute particles, but the osmotic effect becomes reduced with greater solute permeability across the semipermeable membrane. It is also true that, at a specific moment, water molecules can move towards either the higher or lower concentration solutions, but the net movement of water is towards the higher solute concentration. The compartment with the highest solute and lowest water concentration has the greatest osmotic pressure. Osmotic pressure can be calculated using the Van 't Hoff equation, which states that osmotic pressure depends on the number of solute particles, temperature, and how well a solute particle can move across a membrane. Its measured osmolality can describe the osmotic pressure of a solution. The osmolality of a solution describes how many particles are dissolved in the solution. The reflection coefficient of a semipermeable membrane describes how well solutes permeate the membrane. This coefficient ranges from 0 to 1. A reflection coefficient of 1 means a solute is impermeable. A reflection coefficient of 0 means a solute can be freely permeable, and the solute cannot generate osmotic pressure across the membrane. [2] The compartment with the greatest osmotic pressure pulls water in and tends to equalize the solute concentration difference between the compartments. The physical driving force of osmosis is the increase in entropy generated by the movement of free water molecules. It is also thought that the interaction of solute particles with membrane pores generates a negative pressure, which is the osmotic pressure driving the water flow. [3] Reverse osmosis occurs when water is forced to flow in the opposite direction. In reverse osmosis, water flows into the compartment with lower osmotic pressure and higher water concentration. This flow is only possible by applying an external force to the system. Reverse osmosis is commonly used to purify drinking water and requires energy input. [4] The concept of osmosis should not be confused with diffusion. Diffusion is the net movement of particles from an area of high to low concentration. One can think of osmosis as a specific type of diffusion. Both osmosis and diffusion are passive processes and involve the movement of particles from an area of high to low concentration. [2] [5]
Document 3 (Title: Physiology_Levy): In capillaries, diffusion of lipid-insoluble molecules is restricted to water-filled channels or pores. Movement of solute across the capillary endothelium is complex and involves corrections for attractions between solute and solvent molecules, interactions between solute molecules, pore configuration, and charge on the molecules in relation to charge on the endothelial cells. Such solute motion is not simply a matter of random thermal movement of molecules that seemingly run down a concentration gradient. For small molecules, such as water, NaCl, urea, and glucose, the capillary pores offer little restriction to diffusion (i.e., they have a low reflection coefficient; see the section “ ”). Diffusion of these substances is so rapid that the mean concentration gradient across the capillary endothelium is extremely small. The larger the lipid-insoluble molecules are, the more restricted is their diffusion through capillaries. Diffusion eventually becomes minimal when the molecular
