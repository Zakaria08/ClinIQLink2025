Document 1 (Title: Physiology, Osmosis -- Introduction): Osmosis, Greek for push, is the net movement of water across a semipermeable membrane (see Figure. Osmosis). [1] [2] Across this membrane, water tends to move from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration. It is important to emphasize that ideal osmosis requires only the movement of pure water across the membrane without any movement of solute particles across the semipermeable membrane. Osmosis can still occur with some permeability of solute particles, but the osmotic effect becomes reduced with greater solute permeability across the semipermeable membrane. It is also true that, at a specific moment, water molecules can move towards either the higher or lower concentration solutions, but the net movement of water is towards the higher solute concentration. The compartment with the highest solute and lowest water concentration has the greatest osmotic pressure. Osmotic pressure can be calculated using the Van 't Hoff equation, which states that osmotic pressure depends on the number of solute particles, temperature, and how well a solute particle can move across a membrane. Its measured osmolality can describe the osmotic pressure of a solution. The osmolality of a solution describes how many particles are dissolved in the solution. The reflection coefficient of a semipermeable membrane describes how well solutes permeate the membrane. This coefficient ranges from 0 to 1. A reflection coefficient of 1 means a solute is impermeable. A reflection coefficient of 0 means a solute can be freely permeable, and the solute cannot generate osmotic pressure across the membrane. [2] The compartment with the greatest osmotic pressure pulls water in and tends to equalize the solute concentration difference between the compartments. The physical driving force of osmosis is the increase in entropy generated by the movement of free water molecules. It is also thought that the interaction of solute particles with membrane pores generates a negative pressure, which is the osmotic pressure driving the water flow. [3] Reverse osmosis occurs when water is forced to flow in the opposite direction. In reverse osmosis, water flows into the compartment with lower osmotic pressure and higher water concentration. This flow is only possible by applying an external force to the system. Reverse osmosis is commonly used to purify drinking water and requires energy input. [4] The concept of osmosis should not be confused with diffusion. Diffusion is the net movement of particles from an area of high to low concentration. One can think of osmosis as a specific type of diffusion. Both osmosis and diffusion are passive processes and involve the movement of particles from an area of high to low concentration. [2] [5]
Document 2 (Title: Physiology_Levy): In capillaries, diffusion of lipid-insoluble molecules is restricted to water-filled channels or pores. Movement of solute across the capillary endothelium is complex and involves corrections for attractions between solute and solvent molecules, interactions between solute molecules, pore configuration, and charge on the molecules in relation to charge on the endothelial cells. Such solute motion is not simply a matter of random thermal movement of molecules that seemingly run down a concentration gradient. For small molecules, such as water, NaCl, urea, and glucose, the capillary pores offer little restriction to diffusion (i.e., they have a low reflection coefficient; see the section “ ”). Diffusion of these substances is so rapid that the mean concentration gradient across the capillary endothelium is extremely small. The larger the lipid-insoluble molecules are, the more restricted is their diffusion through capillaries. Diffusion eventually becomes minimal when the molecular
Document 3 (Title: Molecular diffusion): In case of an ideal mix, the particle diffusion equation holds true and the diffusion coefficient D the speed of diffusion in the particle diffusion equation is independent of particle concentration. In other cases, resulting interactions between particles within the solvent will account for the following effects: the diffusion coefficient D in the particle diffusion equation becomes dependent of concentration. For an attractive interaction between particles, the diffusion coefficient tends to decrease as concentration increases. For a repulsive interaction between particles, the diffusion coefficient tends to increase as concentration increases. In the case of an attractive interaction between particles, particles exhibit a tendency to coalesce and form clusters if their concentration lies above a certain threshold. This is equivalent to a precipitation chemical reaction (and if the considered diffusing particles are chemical molecules in solution, then it is a precipitation).
