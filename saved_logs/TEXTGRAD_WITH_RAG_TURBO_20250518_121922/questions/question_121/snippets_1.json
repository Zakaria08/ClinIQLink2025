        "content": "Osmosis, Greek for push, is the net movement of water across a semipermeable membrane (see Figure. Osmosis). [1] [2] Across this membrane, water tends to move from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration. It is important to\u00a0emphasize that ideal osmosis requires only the movement of pure water across the membrane without any movement of solute particles across the semipermeable membrane. Osmosis can still occur with some permeability of solute particles, but the osmotic effect becomes reduced with greater solute permeability across the semipermeable membrane. It is also true that, at a specific moment, water molecules can move towards either the higher or lower concentration solutions, but the net movement of water is towards the higher solute concentration.\u00a0The compartment with the highest solute and lowest water concentration has the greatest osmotic pressure.\u00a0Osmotic pressure can be calculated using the Van 't Hoff equation, which states that osmotic pressure depends on the number of solute particles, temperature, and how well a solute particle can move across a membrane. Its measured osmolality can describe the osmotic pressure of a solution. The osmolality of a solution describes how many particles are dissolved in the solution. The reflection coefficient of a semipermeable membrane describes how well solutes permeate the membrane. This coefficient ranges from 0 to 1. A reflection coefficient of 1 means a solute is impermeable. A reflection coefficient of 0 means a solute can be freely permeable, and the solute cannot generate osmotic pressure across the membrane. [2] The compartment with the greatest osmotic pressure pulls water in and tends to equalize the solute concentration difference between the compartments. The physical driving force of osmosis\u00a0is the increase in entropy generated by\u00a0the movement of free water molecules. It is also thought that the interaction of solute particles with membrane pores\u00a0generates a negative pressure, which is the osmotic pressure driving the water flow. [3] Reverse osmosis occurs when water is forced to flow in the opposite direction. In reverse osmosis, water flows into the compartment with lower osmotic pressure and higher water concentration. This flow is only possible by applying an external force to the system. Reverse osmosis is commonly used to purify drinking water and requires energy input. [4] The concept of osmosis should not be confused with diffusion. Diffusion is the net movement of particles from an area of high to low concentration. One can think of osmosis as a specific type of diffusion.\u00a0Both osmosis and diffusion are passive processes and involve the movement of particles from an area of high to low concentration.

        "content": "In capillaries, diffusion of lipid-insoluble molecules is restricted to water-filled channels or pores. Movement of solute across the capillary endothelium is complex and involves corrections for attractions between solute and solvent molecules, interactions between solute molecules, pore configuration, and charge on the molecules in relation to charge on the endothelial cells. Such solute motion is not simply a matter of random thermal movement of molecules that seemingly run down a concentration gradient. For small molecules, such as water, NaCl, urea, and glucose, the capillary pores offer little restriction to diffusion (i.e., they have a low reflection coefficient; see the section \u201c \u201d). Diffusion of these substances is so rapid that the mean concentration gradient across the capillary endothelium is extremely small. The larger the lipid-insoluble molecules are, the more restricted is their diffusion through capillaries. Diffusion eventually becomes minimal when the molecular",

        "title": "Different mechanism of magnesium and calcium transport across rat duodenum.",
        "content": "Concentration and voltage dependence of Mg transport across the rat duodenum was measured in an Ussing chamber. Mucosa (m) to serosa (s) Mg flux exhibits a cellular fraction comparable to that found for Ca. Mg sm flux is purely diffusive and probably restricted to the paracellular pathway. At all concentrations between 0.5 and 5 mmol/liter, Mg is secreted. Diffuse sm Mg flux is 3.5 times higher than the diffusive component of ms Mg transport. This prevalence of diffusive sm Mg flux over that from mucosa to serosa, which may be explained by an \"anomalous solvent drag effect,\" is responsible for the Mg secretion observed. Mg 5 mmol/liter decreases ms Ca flux and abolishes Ca absorption. The voltage clamp experiments reveal that Mg has no effect on the cellular transport but only decreases diffusive ms Ca flux. 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 has only a small effect on cellular Mg transport but remarkably stimulates ms Ca flux and increases Ca absorption by about 85%. Dexamethasone increases ms Mg flux but decreases ms Ca transport and hereby abolished Mg secretion or Ca absorption. In conclusion, Mg is secreted across the short-circuited duodenum whereas Ca is absorbed. There is evidence that both earth alkalines are transported by distinct cellular mechanisms. The data also demonstrate that diffusive movement across the paracellular pathway plays an important role on net Mg transport.",
