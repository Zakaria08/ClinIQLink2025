== Original Prompt ==
Question: Select the correct statement(s) regarding osmolarity and osmolality:
Options:
1. Osmolarity is the number of osmoles per liter of solution
2. Osmolality is the number of osmoles per kilogram of solvent
3. In plasma, proteins representing about 7% of the total volume, osmolality equals osmolarity divided by 0.93
4. Osmolarity and osmolality can be confused for a dilute aqueous solution
5. Plasma osmolarity is measured by cryoscopy

== Full Prompt ==
Can you accurately distinguish and explain the key differences between osmolarity and osmolality, and identify the correct statement(s) related to these concepts?

== Answer ==
{
  "answer": ["1", "2"]
}

== Feedback ==
Incorrect answer: The answer incorrectly includes option "4" and omits option "3"; the prompt should clarify that both osmolarity and osmolality are often similar in dilute solutions, but option "3" is a specific correct statement.

== Improved Full Prompt ==
Please clarify and differentiate the key aspects of osmolality, and highlight the true statement(s) regarding these concepts.
