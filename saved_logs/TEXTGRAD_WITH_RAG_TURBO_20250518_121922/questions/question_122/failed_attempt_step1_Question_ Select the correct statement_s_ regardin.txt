== Original Prompt ==
Question: Select the correct statement(s) regarding osmolarity and osmolality:
Options:
1. Osmolarity is the number of osmoles per liter of solution
2. Osmolality is the number of osmoles per kilogram of solvent
3. In plasma, proteins representing about 7% of the total volume, osmolality equals osmolarity divided by 0.93
4. Osmolarity and osmolality can be confused for a dilute aqueous solution
5. Plasma osmolarity is measured by cryoscopy

Respond strictly in valid JSON format as shown below:
{"answer": ["1", "3"]} ← if options 1 and 3 are correct
