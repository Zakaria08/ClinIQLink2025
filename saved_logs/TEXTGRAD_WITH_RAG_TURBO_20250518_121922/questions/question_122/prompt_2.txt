Document 1 (Title: Drinking induced by cellular dehydration in the quail, Coturnix coturnix japonica.): 1. Drinking was induced in water-replete quail 5-10 min after intravenous injection of hypertonic NaCl (0.69 osmol/l) or sucrose (1.06 osmol/l), but hypertonic urea (2.78 osmol/l) failed to induce drinking. 2. The birds drank approximately the amount required to dilute the injected solutes to isotonicity for each given dose of NaCl or sucrose. 3. The plasma angiotensin II level decreased after injection of 7% NaCl (2.5 osmol/l), but it increased after injection of an equi-osmolar solution of sucrose (65%). 4. Plasma osmolality and Na+ concentration returned quickly to control levels, and then decreased further, after injection of 7% NaCl or 65% sucrose. 5. Blood volume and blood pressure increased immediately after injection of 7% NaCl or 65% sucrose. 6. These results show that drinking is induced after injection of hypertonic solutions exclusively by cellular dehydration, and other regulatory mechanisms for thirst, such as extracellular dehydration and the renin-angiotensin system, are rather inhibitory after injection of hypertonic NaCl.
Document 2 (Title: Physiology_Levy): Equation 1.8 Osmolarity = concentration × number of dissociable particles mOsm/L = mmol/L × number of particles The terms osmolarity and osmolality are frequently confused and incorrectly interchanged. Osmolarity refers to the osmotic pressure generated by the dissolved solute molecules in 1 L of solvent, whereas osmolality is the number of molecules dissolved in 1 kg of solvent. For a dilute solution, the difference between osmolarity and osmolality is cNaCl does not completely dissociate in water. The value for n is 1.88 rather than 2. However, for simplicity, the value of 2 is most often used.
Document 3 (Title: Physiology, Plasma Osmolality and Oncotic Pressure -- Issues of Concern): Osmolarity is the number of osmoles of solute per liter solution, which is different from osmolality, which is the osmoles per kilogram of solution. Osmoles are different from moles in that they consider the dissociation of cations and anions in water. For example:

Please clarify and differentiate the key aspects of osmolality, and highlight the true statement(s) regarding these concepts.

Options:
1. Osmolarity is the number of osmoles per liter of solution
2. Osmolality is the number of osmoles per kilogram of solvent
3. In plasma, proteins representing about 7% of the total volume, osmolality equals osmolarity divided by 0.93
4. Osmolarity and osmolality can be confused for a dilute aqueous solution
5. Plasma osmolarity is measured by cryoscopy
