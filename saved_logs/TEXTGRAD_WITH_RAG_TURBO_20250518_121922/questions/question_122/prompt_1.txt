With your own knowledge and the help of the following document:

Document 1 (Title: Relationship between osmolality and osmolarity.): Since the compendia require the osmolarity of certain parenterals to be labeled and since experimentally only the osmolality can be measured, it is necessary to obtain the relationship between these two quantities. This relationship was determined by considering fundamental physical-chemical definitions. The osmolality of a solution was found to be simply related to the osmotic coefficient. The conversion to osmolarity requires the use of the partial molal volume(s) of the solute(s). A single conversion factor is required for a particular solute system; i.e., the conversion factor is independent of the solution concentration.
Document 2 (Title: Physiology, Plasma Osmolality and Oncotic Pressure -- Issues of Concern): Osmolarity is the number of osmoles of solute per liter solution, which is different from osmolality, which is the osmoles per kilogram of solution. Osmoles are different from moles in that they consider the dissociation of cations and anions in water. For example:
Document 3 (Title: Physiology_Levy): Equation 1.8 Osmolarity = concentration × number of dissociable particles mOsm/L = mmol/L × number of particles The terms osmolarity and osmolality are frequently confused and incorrectly interchanged. Osmolarity refers to the osmotic pressure generated by the dissolved solute molecules in 1 L of solvent, whereas osmolality is the number of molecules dissolved in 1 kg of solvent. For a dilute solution, the difference between osmolarity and osmolality is cNaCl does not completely dissociate in water. The value for n is 1.88 rather than 2. However, for simplicity, the value of 2 is most often used.

Can you accurately distinguish and explain the key differences between osmolarity and osmolality, and identify the correct statement(s) related to these concepts?

Options:
1. Osmolarity is the number of osmoles per liter of solution
2. Osmolality is the number of osmoles per kilogram of solvent
3. In plasma, proteins representing about 7% of the total volume, osmolality equals osmolarity divided by 0.93
4. Osmolarity and osmolality can be confused for a dilute aqueous solution
5. Plasma osmolarity is measured by cryoscopy
