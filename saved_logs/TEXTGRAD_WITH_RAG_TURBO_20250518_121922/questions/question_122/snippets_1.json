        "title": "Relationship between osmolality and osmolarity.",
        "content": "Since the compendia require the osmolarity of certain parenterals to be labeled and since experimentally only the osmolality can be measured, it is necessary to obtain the relationship between these two quantities. This relationship was determined by considering fundamental physical-chemical definitions. The osmolality of a solution was found to be simply related to the osmotic coefficient. The conversion to osmolarity requires the use of the partial molal volume(s) of the solute(s). A single conversion factor is required for a particular solute system; i.e., the conversion factor is independent of the solution concentration.",

Osmolarity refers to the osmotic pressure generated by the dissolved solute molecules in 1 L of solvent, whereas osmolality is the number of molecules dissolved in 1 kg of solvent. For a dilute solution, the difference between osmolarity and osmolality is cNaCl does not completely dissociate in water. The value for n is 1.88 rather than 2. However, for simplicity, the value of 2 is most often used.",
