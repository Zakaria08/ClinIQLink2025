Document 1 (Title: Papilledema): In intracranial hypertension, the optic disc swelling most commonly occurs bilaterally. When papilledema is found on fundoscopy, further evaluation is warranted because vision loss can result if the underlying condition is not treated. Further evaluation with a CT or MRI of the brain and/or spine is usually performed. Recent research has shown that point-of-care ultrasound can be used to measure optic nerve sheath diameter for detection of increased intracranial pressure and shows good diagnostic test accuracy compared to CT. Thus, if there is a question of papilledema on fundoscopic examination or if the optic disc cannot be adequately visualized, ultrasound can be used to rapidly assess for increased intracranial pressure and help direct further evaluation and intervention. Unilateral papilledema can suggest a disease in the eye itself, such as an optic nerve glioma. Signs and symptoms
Document 2 (Title: Illness Anxiety Disorder -- Evaluation): B. Somatic symptoms are absent. If somatic symptoms are present, they are only mildly distressing to the patient. If a medical condition is present or a high-risk for developing a medical condition is present (due to family history), the anxiety regarding the medical condition (or potential impending medical condition) is excessive. C. Excessive concern and anxiety regarding health-related issues. D. The individual exhibits disproportionate and redundant health-related behaviors, such as repeatedly checking his or her body for indications of disease. E. Symptoms have been present for at least 6 months F. The illness-related preoccupation is not better explained by another psychiatric condition Specify if : Care-seeking type: Medical care, including physician visits or undergoing tests and procedures, is over-utilized. [1] Care-avoidant type: Medical care is rarely used or avoided. [1]
Document 3 (Title: [An experience of single dose captopril renal scintigraphy in the diagnosis and management of bilateral renovascular hypertension].): A 41-year-old woman visited our hospital with chief complaint of hypertension which was refractory to multiple antihypertensive drugs. Her blood pressure was 200/140 mmHg and her plasma renin activity was as high as 3.1 ng/ml/hr. Angiography revealed bilateral renal artery stenosis. To determine the laterality of the kidney which were responsible for her hypertension, the 99mTc-DTPA renal scintigraphy with captopril was performed. The estimated GFR of the right kidney was lowered than that of the control, while there was no change in the left kidney. Subsequently Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty (PTA) was performed to the right kidney. Postoperatively blood pressure remained elevated as well as serum renin level. 99mTc-DTPA scintigraphy with captopril was repeated and revealed no decrease in the GFR of the right kidney this time, but significant reduction in the GFR of the left kidney. After the second PTA to the left kidney, her blood pressure was finally normalized. Postoperatively GFR of both kidneys was not affected by captopril on renal scintigraphy, and currently she has remained normotensive without medication. 99mTc-DTPA scintigraphy with captopril appears to be a useful method to diagnose the laterality and to evaluate in clinical response to therapeutic intervention.

A 63-year-old woman visits her primary-care doctor for evaluation due to recent health concerns. Based on her age, medical history, and current symptoms, what is the most appropriate next diagnostic test to perform to accurately assess her condition?
