Document 1 (Title: Interval adherence to mammography screening guidelines.): The objectives of this research were to document adherence to mammography screening guidelines among women over 50 years of age and to investigate factors related to adherence. Selected sociodemographic variables--personal breast health history, provider-related variables, and medical care utilization--were studied. Data were collected through a random digit dial telephone survey of 693 women from two geographic areas. While 48% had had a mammogram in the last year, only 20% reported at least two recent mammograms at yearly intervals. Adherence was significantly associated with having a higher income, being white, being 51 to 64 years old and having had breast symptoms and/or a family history of breast cancer. Additionally, women who had a regular physician, higher frequency of clinical breast examination, and a recent physician visit were more adherent. Women enrolled in Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs) and/or covered by commercial plans were more adherent than women with no insurance or with entitlement coverage only. These relationships were generally maintained in multivariate analysis. While this study is consistent with others that demonstrate increasing adoption of mammographic screening, it also illustrates that the goal of regular screening according to guidelines has yet to be achieved.
Document 2 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Since the most common manifestation of UTI is acute cystitis and since acute cystitis is far more prevalent among women than among men, most clinical research on UTI has involved women. Many studies have enrolled women from college campuses or large health maintenance organizations in the United States. Therefore, when reviewing the literature and recommendations concerning UTI, clinicians must consider whether the findings are applicable to their patient populations.
Document 3 (Title: Health maintenance organization): In 1970, the number of HMOs declined to fewer than 40. Paul M. Ellwood Jr., often called the "father" of the HMO, began having discussions with what is today the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that led to the enactment of the Health Maintenance Organization Act of 1973. This act had three main provisions: Grants and loans were provided to plan, start, or expand an HMO Certain state-imposed restrictions on HMOs were removed if the HMOs were federally certified Employers with 25 or more employees were required to offer federally certified HMO options alongside indemnity upon request This last provision, called the dual choice provision, was the most important, as it gave HMOs access to the critical employer-based market that had often been blocked in the past. The federal government was slow to issue regulations and certify plans until 1977, when HMOs began to grow rapidly. The dual choice provision expired in 1995.
