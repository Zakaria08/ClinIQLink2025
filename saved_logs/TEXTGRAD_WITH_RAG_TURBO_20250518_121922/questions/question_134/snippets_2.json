        "title": "Serum thyroxine and thyroxine-binding proteins in chronic renal failure without nephrosis.",
        "content": "Total serum thyroxine (T4), free thyroxine index (FTI), thyroxine binding globulin (TBG) binding capacity, serum albumin, alpha-globulins and urinary protein excretion were measured in 50 patients with chronic renal failure, but without nephrotic syndrome. 25 patients were undergoing chronic hemodialysis. T4 was within the normal range in most patients. There was a tendency to lower T4 values as compared to an age and sex-matched control group, but this did not reach statistical significance. TBG was normal in most patients. 4 patients showed elevated TBG concomitant with elevation of other alpha-globulins. Serum albumin was significantly decreased. No correlation existed between daily protein excretion and TBG or alpha-globulins, but the correlation between serum albumin and proteinuria was highly significant. T4 and proteinuria correlated with borderline significance. A highly significant correlation between T4 and TBG-albumin values was found. No correlation existed between FTI and TBG-albumin levels. The data suggest that T4 and TBG are normal in most patients with renal failure, even in the presence of significant proteinuria. Low T4 values, when found in renal insufficiency, may be secondary to low serum albumin and possibly prealbumin.",

        "title": "Hypoalbuminemia -- Evaluation",
        "content": "Decreased albumin levels may be an incidental finding on protein electrophoresis; however, protein electrophoresis provides a semi-quantitative albumin value. The main value of protein electrophoresis in a patient with low serum albumin is with the differential diagnosis of hypoalbuminemia. In the presence of acute inflammation, hypoalbuminemia will be present with an increase in alpha-1 and 2 globulins and normal gamma globulins. In chronic inflammation, the protein electrophoresis pattern will show hypoalbuminemia with a polyclonal increase in gamma globulins.",

        "content": "Haptoglobin/haemaglobin complexes migrate more cathodally than haptoglobin as seen in the alpha-2 \u2013 beta interzone. This is typically seen as a broadening of the alpha-2 zone. Alpha-2 macroglobulin may be elevated in children and the elderly. This is seen as a sharp front to the alpha-2 band. AMG is markedly raised (10-fold increase or greater) in association with glomerular protein loss, as in nephrotic syndrome. Due to its large size, AMG cannot pass through glomeruli, while other lower-molecular weight proteins are lost. Enhanced synthesis of AMG accounts for its absolute increase in nephrotic syndrome. Increased AMG is also noted in rats with no albumin indicating that this is a response to low albumin rather than nephrotic syndrome itself AMG is mildly elevated early in the course of diabetic nephropathy.",
