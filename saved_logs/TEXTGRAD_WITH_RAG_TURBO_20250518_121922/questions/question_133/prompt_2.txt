Document 1 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): ETs exert widespread actions in the body. In particular, they cause potent dose-dependent vasoconstriction in most vascular beds. Intravenous administration of ET-1 causes a rapid and transient decrease in arterial blood pressure followed by a sustained increase. The depressor response results from release of prostacyclin and nitric oxide from the vascular endothelium, whereas the pressor response is due to direct contraction of vascular smooth muscle. ETs also exert direct positive inotropic and chronotropic actions on the heart and are potent coronary vasoconstrictors. They act on the kidneys to cause vasoconstriction and decrease glomerular filtration rate and sodium and water excretion. In the respiratory system, they cause potent contraction of tracheal and bronchial smooth muscle. ETs interact with several endocrine systems, increasing the secretion of renin, aldosterone, AVP, and ANP. They exert a variety of actions on the central and peripheral nervous systems, the
Document 2 (Title: Effects of atrial natriuretic factor on the kidney and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.): ANF is a peptide hormone with peripheral and central effects on several physiologic control systems, which suggests broad involvement in the regulation of intravascular volume and cardiovascular homeostasis. ANF acts directly on the kidney to modulate renal vascular resistance, increase glomerular filtration rate, and decrease inner medullary hypertonicity. These hemodynamic effects act in concert to promote marked natriuresis and diuresis and to inhibit renin secretion by the kidney; the potential role of direct effects on tubular transport and on the juxtaglomerular cells remains to be clarified. ANF also inhibits steroidogenesis, most prominently affecting agonist-induced aldosterone biosynthesis by the adrenal cortex. ANF exerts a smooth muscle relaxant effect on isolated vessels constricted with various hormonal agonists. ANF causes especially pronounced antagonism of the adrenal and vascular actions of angiotensin II and antagonizes the latter peptide's central nervous system effects. Although complex systemic hemodynamic mechanisms are involved, ANF-induced vasorelaxation may contribute to its depressor action, particularly in states characterized by angiotensin II-induced vasoconstriction. Distention of the atria is a major stimulus to ANF release and evokes many responses that are mimicked by ANF infusion. Although ANF is not the sole or even dominant mediator of the responses to atrial distention, available data suggest that it plays a role in the renal and hormonal responses to intravascular volume expansion. Definitive assessment of its physiologic and pathophysiologic significance must await development of specific antagonists, but further studies on the mechanisms of action of ANF at the molecular, cellular, and systemic levels are likely to contribute significantly to our understanding of the complex process of volume regulation and cardiovascular homeostasis.
Document 3 (Title: Angiotensin II receptor type 1): Angiotensin II receptor type 1 or AT1 receptor is the best characterized angiotensin receptor. It has vasopressor effects and regulates aldosterone secretion. It is an important effector controlling blood pressure and volume in the cardiovascular system. Angiotensin II receptor antagonists are drugs indicated for hypertension, diabetic nephropathy and congestive heart failure. Function The AT1 receptor mediates the major cardiovascular effects of angiotensin II. Effects include vasoconstriction, aldosterone synthesis and secretion, increased vasopressin secretion, cardiac hypertrophy, augmentation of peripheral noradrenergic activity, vascular smooth muscle cells proliferation, decreased renal blood flow, renal renin inhibition, renal tubular sodium reuptake, modulation of central sympathetic nervous system activity, cardiac contractility, central osmocontrol and extracellular matrix formation.
