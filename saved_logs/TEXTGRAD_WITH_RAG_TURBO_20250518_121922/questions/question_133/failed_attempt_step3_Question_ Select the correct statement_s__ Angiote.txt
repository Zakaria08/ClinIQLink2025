== Original Prompt ==
Question: Select the correct statement(s): Angiotensin II:
Options:
1. Exerts a direct effect on vascular smooth muscle
2. Exerts a direct action on serotonin receptors
3. Increases the release of catecholamines
4. Exerts a stimulating action on renin secretion
5. Modulates aldosterone secretion

Respond strictly in valid JSON format as shown below:
{"answer": ["1", "3"]} ← if options 1 and 3 are correct
Only output the JSON object. Do not include explanations, labels, markdown, or any other text.

== Full Prompt ==
List all true statements about the functions and effects of Angiotensin II.

Options:
1. Exerts a direct effect on vascular smooth muscle
2. Exerts a direct action on serotonin receptors
3. Increases the release of catecholamines
4. Exerts a stimulating action on renin secretion
5. Modulates aldosterone secretion

== Answer ==
{"answer": ["1", "4", "5"]}

== Feedback ==
Incorrect answer: The answer incorrectly includes option "4" and omits option "3"; the prompt should clarify that Angiotensin II decreases renin secretion and increases catecholamine release.

== Improved Full Prompt ==
Provide a comprehensive list of verified statements regarding the physiological roles and impacts of Angiotensin II in the human body.
