Document 1 (Title: Neurology_Adams): In the investigation of a disturbance of vision, one inquires as to what the patient means when he claims that he cannot see properly, for the disturbance in question may vary from nearor farsightedness to diplopia, partial syncope, dizziness, or a hemianopia. Fortunately, the patient’s statement can be checked by the measurement of visual acuity, which is an essential part of the ocular examination. Inspection of the refractive media and the optic fundi, the testing of pupillary reflexes, color vision, and the plotting of visual fields complete this part of the examination. Examination of the eye movements is also essential, particularly if amblyopia predicated on an early life strabismus is suspected, as discussed in Chap. 13.
Document 2 (Title: [Amblyopia: reading speed in comparison with visual acuity for gratings, single Landolt Cs and series Landolt Cs].): In the treatment of amblyopia in preschool children, a means of predicting later reading ability would be helpful. This prediction might be possible using a test for visual acuity where the results correlate with reading ability in adult patients with amblyopia. We measured the following four parameters in 18 experienced readers with strabismic amblyopia: (1) time spent reading ten lines of a standard text in one of three magnifications, (2) visual acuity for gratings, (3) visual acuity for single Landolt Cs, and (4) visual acuity for crowded Landolt Cs (one Landolt C flanked by two full rings on each side each at a distance of 2.6 min of arc). The reading text was presented on paper at a distance of 40 cm; the subject had a choice of three magnifications. The acuity tests were generated by a computer on a VDU at 4.6 m. The relative impairment of the amblyopic eye was defined as the quotient between the performance of the amblyopic and the good eye. In addition, the difference between the times spent reading the ten lines with the amblyopic and with the good eye was calculated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Document 3 (Title: Lea test): Accuracy Among the array of visual assessment picture tests that exist, the LEA symbols tests are the only tests that have been calibrated against the standardized Landolt C vision test symbol. The Landolt C is an optotype that is used throughout most of the world as the standardized symbol for measuring visual acuity. It is identical to the "C" that is used in the traditional Snellen chart. In addition to this, the LEA symbols test has been experimentally verified to be both a valid and reliable measure of visual acuity. As is desirable of a good vision test, each of the four optotypes used in the symbols test has been proven to measure visual acuity similarly and blur equally as well, supporting the test's internal consistency.

What are the differences in acuity measurement between the Landolt C and Snellen E tests in the context of strabismus and amblyopia?
