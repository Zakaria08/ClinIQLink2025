        "content": "The Stroke Data Bank (SDB) is a systematic prospective study of the diagnosis, clinical course, and outcome of a large series of stroke cases. The SDB uses an interdisciplinary approach, with neurologists, nurse clinicians, epidemiologists, statisticians, and computer scientists collaborating to study stroke research issues, including diagnosis of stroke subtypes, characterization of the course and outcome of each stroke type, and identification of nonclinical factors that influence outcome. Research questions germaine to nursing management of stroke patients include: the identification of acute stroke patients likely to develop life-threatening or recovery-impeding complications; assessment of the impact of stroke on ability to perform activities of daily living; determination of how depression affects functional recovery; and identification of quantifiable measures of stroke outcome.",
