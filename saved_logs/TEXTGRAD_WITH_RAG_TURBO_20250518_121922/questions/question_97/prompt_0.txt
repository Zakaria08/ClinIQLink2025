Document 1 (Title: Statin): misleading claims exaggerating the adverse effects of statins had received widespread media coverage, with a consequent negative impact to public health. Controversy over the effectiveness of statins in the medical literature was amplified in popular media in the early 2010s, leading an estimated 200,000 people in the UK to stop using statins over a six-month period to mid 2016, according to the authors of a study funded by the British Heart Foundation. They estimated that there could be up to 2,000 extra heart attacks or strokes over the following 10 years as a consequence. An unintended effect of the academic statin controversy has been the spread of scientifically questionable alternative therapies. Cardiologist Steven Nissen at Cleveland Clinic commented "We are losing the battle for the hearts and minds of our patients to Web sites..." promoting unproven medical therapies. Harriet Hall sees a spectrum of "statin denialism" ranging from pseudoscientific claims to the
Document 2 (Title: The Stroke Data Bank project: implications for nursing research.): The Stroke Data Bank (SDB) is a systematic prospective study of the diagnosis, clinical course, and outcome of a large series of stroke cases. The SDB uses an interdisciplinary approach, with neurologists, nurse clinicians, epidemiologists, statisticians, and computer scientists collaborating to study stroke research issues, including diagnosis of stroke subtypes, characterization of the course and outcome of each stroke type, and identification of nonclinical factors that influence outcome. Research questions germaine to nursing management of stroke patients include: the identification of acute stroke patients likely to develop life-threatening or recovery-impeding complications; assessment of the impact of stroke on ability to perform activities of daily living; determination of how depression affects functional recovery; and identification of quantifiable measures of stroke outcome.
Document 3 (Title: Diagnostic Testing Accuracy: Sensitivity, Specificity, Predictive Values and Likelihood Ratios -- Issues of Concern -- PPV and NPV): PPVs determine, out of all of the positive findings, how many are true positives; NPVs determine, out of all of the negative findings, how many are true negatives. As the value increases toward 100, it approaches a ‘gold standard.’ [3] The formulas for PPV and NPV are below. Positive Predictive Value=(True Positives (A))/(True Positives (A)+False Positives (B)) Negative Predictive Value=(True Negatives (D))/(True Negatives (D)+False Negatives(C))
