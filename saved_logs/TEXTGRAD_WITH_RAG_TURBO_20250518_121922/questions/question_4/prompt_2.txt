With your own knowledge and the help of the following document:

Document 1 (Title: First_Aid_Step2): What is metabolic syndrome? Appropriate diagnostic test? A 50-year-old man with angina can exercise to 85% of maximum predicted heart rate. A 65-year-old woman with left bundle branch block and severe osteoarthritis has unstable angina. Target LDL in a patient with diabetes. Signs of active ischemia during stress testing. ECG findings suggesting MI. Coronary territories in MI. A young patient has angina at rest with ST-segment elevation. Cardiac enzymes are normal. Common symptoms associated with silent Mls. The diagnostic test for pulmonary embolism. An agent that reverses the effects of heparin. The coagulation parameter affected by warfarin. A young patient with a family history of sudden death collapses and dies while exercising. Endocarditis prophylaxis regimens. The 6 P’s of ischemia due to peripheral vascular disease. Virchow’s triad. The most common cause of hypertension in young women. The most common cause of hypertension in young men.
Document 2 (Title: Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis -- Prognosis): Although the actual survival range for individual patients varies considerably, up to 20% to 25% may live beyond 10 years after diagnosis. Despite this, most patients continue to experience dyspnea and limited exercise tolerance, leading to a poor quality of life. Deaths are most common in winter, even in the absence of lung infections. Many patients develop pulmonary hypertension, increasing their risk of pulmonary embolism and sudden cardiac death. The prognosis tends to be worse for those with severe changes noted on imaging findings and a lack of response to oxygen therapy. [69] [70]
Document 3 (Title: Pulmonary artery): Clinical significance The pulmonary artery is relevant in a number of clinical states. Pulmonary hypertension is used to describe an increase in the pressure of the pulmonary artery, and may be defined as a mean pulmonary artery pressure of greater than 25mmHg. As can be measured on a CT scan, a diameter of more than 29 mm diameter is often used as a cut-off to indicate pulmonary hypertension. In Chest X-rays, diameter of descending pulmonary artery more than 16 mm indicates pulmonary hypertension. This may occur as a result of heart problems such as heart failure, lung or airway disease such as COPD or scleroderma, or thromboembolic disease such as pulmonary embolism or emboli seen in sickle cell anaemia. Most recently, computational fluid based tools (non-invasive) have been proposed to be at par with the current clinical tests (invasive) of pulmonary hypertension.

Analyze the lung autopsy results of a 58-year-old woman, focusing on the identified pathological changes. Based on these findings, what is the most likely pathogenesis responsible for these changes?

Options:
A. Thromboembolism
B. Pulmonary ischemia
C. Pulmonary hypertension
D. Pulmonary passive congestion
