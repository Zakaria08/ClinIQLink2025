        "content": "By illuminating the genetic information that encodes the most fundamental processes of life, genomic technologies are transforming many aspects of medicine. In infectious diseases, methods such as next-generation sequencing and genome-scale expression analysis offer information of unprecedented depth about individual microbes as well as microbial communities. This information is expanding our understanding of the interactions of these microorganisms and communities with one another, with their human hosts, and with the environment. Despite significant progress and the abundant genomic data now available, technological and financial barriers continue to impede the widespread adoption of large-scale pathogen sequencing in clinical, public health, and research settings. As even vaster amounts of data are generated, innovations in storage, development of bioinformatics tools to manipulate the data, standardization of methods, and training of end-users in both the research and clinical",

        "content": "There are three major approaches to developing self-report inventories: theory-guided, factor analysis, and criterion-keyed. Theory-guided inventories are constructed around a theory of personality or a prototype of a construct. Factor analysis uses statistical methods to organize groups of related items into subscales. Criterion-keyed inventories include questions that have been shown to statistically discriminate between a comparison group and a criterion group, such as people with clinical diagnoses of depression versus a control group. Items may use any of several formats: a Likert scale with ranked options, true-false, or forced choice, although other formats such as sentence completion or visual analog scales are possible. True-false involves questions that the individual denotes as either being true or false about themselves. Forced-choice is a set of statements that require the individual to choose one as being most representative of themselves.",
