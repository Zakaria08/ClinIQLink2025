L. monocytogenes is of interest not only to clinicians but also to basic scientists as a model intracellular pathogen that is used to study basic mechanisms of microbial pathogenesis and host immunity.

        "content": "Listeria commonly causes meningitis in the young (neonates), elderly, and immunocompromised patient population. Healthy individuals infected with L. monocytogenes typically have a self-limiting gastrointestinal infection with fever and diarrhea. The Listeria family consists of 10 different species with L. monocytogenes found most consistently in humans. L. monocytogenes has 13 different serotypes based on a variety of flagellar and surface antigens. \u00a0However, there are only three serotypes (1/2a, 1/2b, 4a) that inflict disease in humans. [3] In general, the infectious dose of L. monocytogenes is large, meaning one must ingest a large number to cause clinical infection, but as growth and division can continue at refrigerator temperatures, these levels can\u00a0be reached despite typical food storage precautions. Host immune response also affects the infectious dose. Utilization of proton pump inhibitors or other stomach acid suppression modalities makes it easier for L. monocytogenes to pass through the stomach and invade enterocytes.",

        "title": "Treatment options for the pharmacological therapy of neonatal meningitis.",
        "content": "Neonatal bacterial meningitis has a relatively low incidence in developed countries, but continues to cause morbidity and mortality despite advances in antimicrobial therapy. Bacterial pathogens commonly associated with neonatal meningitis include Group B streptococci, Escherichia coli K1 and other coliforms, Listeria monocytogenes and staphylococci. As it can be difficult to differentiate meningitis from septicaemia in neonates, empirical antibiotic therapy should be effective for both. Selection of an empirical antibiotic regimen should be based on: (a) bacterial prevalence and susceptibility; (b) drug characteristics; (c) postnatal age at the onset of disease; and (d) patient-specific factors. A penicillin in combination with an aminoglycoside or cefotaxime is commonly used in empirical therapies. The increased risk of staphylococcal infection in older neonates requires consideration of an antistaphylococcal antibiotic in the empirical therapy regimen. Once a causative organism has been identified, antimicrobial therapy should be directed towards that pathogen. Duration of therapy remains empirical, but should be at least 7 days for documented bacterial meningitis. Viral meningitis continues to have a high mortality despite the availability of antiviral agents. Adjunctive therapies may further reduce the morbidity and mortality of meningitis. While most of these therapeutic options have not been investigated in neonates, they may prove to be of benefit in the future. Anti-inflammatory agents, such as glucocorticoids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents and immunoglobulin, may modulate the inflammatory response of a meningeal infection. Other possible therapies in neonatal meningitis include cerebral blood flow modulators and disease prevention with maternal vaccines and perinatal antibiotics. Practical aspects of drug therapy such as route of administration and serum drug concentration monitoring can improve both drug therapy and patient outcome. While antibiotics have greatly improved the treatment outcome of neonatal meningitis, it is clear that additional intervention will be required to increase cure rates and reduce sequelae.",
