Document 1 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): 982 Listeria monocytogenes Infections Elizabeth L. Hohmann, Daniel A. Portnoy Listeria monocytogenes is a food-borne pathogen that can cause serious infections, particularly in pregnant women and immunocompromised 176 individuals. A ubiquitous saprophytic environmental bacterium, L. monocytogenes is also a facultative intracellular pathogen with a broad host range. Humans are probably accidental hosts for this microorganism. L. monocytogenes is of interest not only to clinicians but also to basic scientists as a model intracellular pathogen that is used to study basic mechanisms of microbial pathogenesis and host immunity. L. monocytogenes is a facultatively anaerobic, nonsporulating, gram-positive rod that grows over a broad temperature range, including refrigeration temperatures. This organism is motile during growth at low temperatures but much less so at 37°C. The vast majority of cases of human listerial disease can be traced to serotypes 1/2a, 1/2b, and 4.
Document 2 (Title: Roles of Listeria monocytogenes virulence factors in survival: virulence factors distinct from listeriolysin are needed for the organism to survive an early neutrophil-mediated host defense mechanism.): Avirulent mutant strains of Listeria monocytogenes which fail to produce phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C, or which produce reduced amounts of hemolytic listeriolysin O, are incapable of causing progressive infection in normal mice. However, both strains can grow progressively in mice that have been rendered incapable of focusing neutrophils at sites of infection as a result of being treated with monoclonal antibody 5C6, specific for the type 3 complement receptor of myelomonocytic cells. In 5C6-treated mice, phospholipase C-negative and listeriolysin-defective mutant strains of L. monocytogenes, like the wild-type strain, give rise in the liver to large numbers of discrete foci of infected hepatocytes that retain their morphological integrity during the first 24 h, despite their large bacterial burden. In normal mice, in contrast, sites of infection in the liver are indicated by discrete focal accumulations of neutrophils that occupy the space originally occupied by infected hepatocytes. It is apparent that in normal mice neutrophils function to lyse infected hepatocytes and thereby to release L. monocytogenes for ingestion and killing by neutrophils themselves and by macrophages. However, whereas a proportion of wild-type organisms survive this early mechanism of defense to give rise to progressive infection, the phospholipase C-negative organisms are totally eliminated. On the basis of these and other results, it is suggested that virulence factors other than listeriolysin are needed by L. monocytogenes to counteract the early neutrophil-mediated mechanism of defense. Listeriolysin, itself, is an intrinsic virulence factor that allows L. monocytogenes to survive and multiply in a proportion of the fixed phagocytes of the liver (permissive phagocytes) and which enables the organism to go on to infect and replicate in adjacent hepatocytes. It was found that a mutant strain of L. monocytogenes incapable of producing any listeriolysin was incapable of establishing progressive infection, even in 5C6-treated mice.
Document 3 (Title: Listeria Monocytogenes -- Etiology): Listeria commonly causes meningitis in the young (neonates), elderly, and immunocompromised patient population. Healthy individuals infected with L. monocytogenes typically have a self-limiting gastrointestinal infection with fever and diarrhea. The Listeria family consists of 10 different species with L. monocytogenes found most consistently in humans. L. monocytogenes has 13 different serotypes based on a variety of flagellar and surface antigens.  However, there are only three serotypes (1/2a, 1/2b, 4a) that inflict disease in humans. [3] In general, the infectious dose of L. monocytogenes is large, meaning one must ingest a large number to cause clinical infection, but as growth and division can continue at refrigerator temperatures, these levels can be reached despite typical food storage precautions. Host immune response also affects the infectious dose. Utilization of proton pump inhibitors or other stomach acid suppression modalities makes it easier for L. monocytogenes to pass through the stomach and invade enterocytes.
