        "content": "Plasmodium mackerrasae is a parasite of the genus Plasmodium. Like all Plasmodium species P. mackerrasae has both vertebrate and insect hosts. The vertebrate hosts for this parasite are reptiles. Description The parasite was first described by Telford in 1979. Both schizonts and gametocytes parasitize all cells in the erythrocyte series. The presence of pigment in both asexual and sexual stages is correlated with maturity of the host cell. While asexual forms contain a single large vacuole, the mature gametocytes may show 1-4 vacuoles. The mature schizonts containing 6-12 nuclei arranged peripherally as a rosette. The gametocytes are round to oval and are equal to or slightly smaller than host cell nuclei. This species resembles Plasmodium sasai and Plasmodium tropiduri. It may be distinguished from these species by the following characteristics: P. sasai possess fan-shaped schizonts and its gametocytes are more heavily pigmented",

        "content": "An anopheline mosquito inoculates plasmodium sporozoites to initiate human infection (Figure 52\u20131). Circulating sporozoites rapidly invade liver cells, and exoerythrocytic stage tissue schizonts mature in the liver. Merozoites are subsequently released from the liver and invade erythrocytes. Only erythrocytic parasites cause clinical illness. Repeated cycles of infection can lead to the infection of many erythrocytes and serious disease. Sexual stage gametocytes also develop in erythrocytes before being taken up by mosquitoes, where they develop into infective sporozoites.",

        "content": "Plasmodium mackerrasae sp. n. parasitizes the Australian lizards Egernia cunninghami and E. striolata (Sauria: Scincidae). Described from an experimental host, E. whitei, it produces mature schizonts containing 6--12 nuclei arranged peripherally as a rosette, and round to oval gametocytes which are equal to or slightly smaller than host cell nuclei. Both schizonts and gametocytes parasitize all cells in the erythrocyte series. Presence of pigment in both asexual and sexual stages is correlated with maturity of the host cell. Asexual forms contain a single large vacuole, whereas mature gametocytes may show 1--4 vacuoles. Plasmodium mackerrasae resembles most closely P. sasai of Japan and P. tropiduri of tropical America. It differs from P. sasai by lacking fan-shaped schizonts and by having less heavily pigmented gametocytes, and from P. tropiduri by less variability in shape and greater vacuolation of the gametocytes. Host and geographic differences further support its distinction.",
