Document 1 (Title: Sexually transmitted diseases in leprosy patients in north and northeastern India. A futile search for human immunodeficiency virus antibody.): Three-hundred-eighty-four leprosy patients were clinically examined for sexually transmitted diseases (STD) in north and northeastern India, revealing a high incidence (5.2%) of STD among them. Eighteen males, one female, and one eunuch were found to have chancroid ulcer, gonococcal urethritis, lymphogranuloma inguinale, and primary chancre. Of these patients, only 100, selected randomly, could be screened serologically for STD due to Treponema pallidum, herpes simplex (type 1 and 2), Entamoeba histolytica, hepatitis-associated virus, cytomegalovirus, Chlamydia trachomatis and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); 100 control sera were included for comparison. In addition, sera from another 133 normal subjects and another 176 lepromatous patients were also screened for HIV antibody. Thus, a total of 233 normal sera and 276 leprosy sera were tested for HIV antibody. Although our leprosy patients have shown significantly high incidences of clinical STD and also high seropositivity against T. pallidum, herpes-simplex viruses types 1 and 2, hepatitis-associated virus, and cytomegalovirus, the search for antibody against HIV was negative. Our clinical and serological data suggest promiscuity in our patient population. The absence of HIV antibody in this high-risk population, however, seems to be an enigma.
Document 2 (Title: Heinrich Pette Institute): Research The aim of the research at the HPI is to develop new approaches for improved diagnostic techniques and therapies for viral diseases and virus-associated tumor diseases. Scholars of the institute explore a wide range of viruses, such as hepatitis viruses (HPV, HCV), herpes viruses (herpes simplex type 1, herpes simplex type 2, Epstein-Barr virus, and Kaposi's sarcoma herpes virus), leukemia viruses (human T-cell leukemia virus-1, murine leukemia virus), coronaviruses, human immunodeficiency virus and DNA tumor viruses (adenoviruses, SV-40). The drive towards practical applications of the results in diagnosis and treatment is reflected in numerous collaborations with clinical institutions and industry. The institute is divided into six research departments, one independent research unit and two independent junior research group. The institute also has two associated groups. The topics of the current working groups are:
Document 3 (Title: Neurology_Adams): A number of viruses share the unique tendency to primarily affect the human nervous system. In some conditions, the systemic effects of the viral infection are negligible; it is the neurologic disorder that brings them to medical attention, that is, the viruses are neurotropic. Included in this group are the human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV-1 and HIV-2), the group of human herpes viruses including herpes simplex viruses (HSV-1 and HSV-2), herpes zoster or varicella zoster virus (VZV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), poliovirus, rabies, and several seasonal arthropod-borne viruses (Flaviviruses). Some of these exhibit an affinity for certain types of neurons: for example, poliomyelitis viruses and motor neurons, VZV and peripheral sensory neurons, and rabies virus and brainstem neurons. Yet others attack nonneuronal supporting glial cells; John Cunningham (JC) virus causing progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy is the prime example. For many of the rest, the
