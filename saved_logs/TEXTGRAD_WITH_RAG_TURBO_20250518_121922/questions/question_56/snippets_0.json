        "title": "Violent patients. Are you prepared to deal with them?",
        "content": "The medical community is becoming increasingly concerned about violent patients in healthcare settings. Healthcare professionals should be trained to deal with aggressive patients, and they should have access to a room free of dangerous objects for evaluation and examination. Having security personnel stand by may be appropriate in some cases. Verbal intervention is the key to dealing with violent patients. The safest and most effective pharmacologic intervention is use of benzodiazepines, either alone or in conjunction with antipsychotic agents when indicated. Seclusion or restraint may be needed for some violent patients; in such situations, close patient monitoring and explicit documentation are essential. Physicians can be held liable for injuries patients sustain while being restrained, so staff members should receive instruction in safe physical intervention techniques.",

        "content": "Push enteroscopy is performed with a long endoscope similar in design to an upper endoscope. The enteroscope is pushed down the small bowel, sometimes with the help of a stiffening overtube that extends from the mouth to the small intestine. The proximal to mid-jejunum is usually reached, and the instrument channel of the endoscope allows for biopsy or endoscopic therapy. Deeper insertion into the small bowel can be accomplished by single-or double-balloon enteroscopy or spiral enteroscopy (Fig. 345-9). These instruments enable pleating of the small intestine onto an over-tube (see Video 346e-1). With balloon-assisted enteroscopy, the entire intestinal tract can be visualized in some patients when both the oral and anal routes of insertion are used. Biopsies and endoscopic therapy can be performed throughout the visualized small bowel (Fig. 345-10).",

The usual treatment, conventional ERCP, is not feasible since the duodenum is excluded and connected to the remnant stomach. Options in this situation are double-balloon enteroscopy, laparoscopic-assisted ERCP with a remnant stomach gastrostomy, percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography, and open common bile duct exploration.
