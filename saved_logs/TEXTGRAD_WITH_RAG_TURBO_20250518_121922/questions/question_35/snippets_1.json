She was diag-nosed with Crohn\u2019s disease 2 years ago, and it involves her terminal ileum and proximal colon, as confirmed by colonoscopy and small bowel radiography. She was initially treated with mesalamine and budesonide with good response, but over the last 2 months, she has had a relapse of her symptoms. She is experiencing fatigue, cramping, abdominal pains, and nonbloody diarrhea up to 10 times daily, and she has had a 15-lb weight loss. She has no other significant medical or surgical his-tory. Her current medications are mesalamine 2.4 g/d and budesonide 9 mg/d. She appears thin and tired. Abdominal examination reveals tenderness without guarding in the right lower quadrant; no masses are palpable. On perianal examination, there is no tenderness, fissure, or fistula. Her laboratory data are notable for anemia and elevated C-reactive protein. What are the options for immediate",

        "content": "Fluoxetine: Fluoxetine\u00a0increases risperidone levels due to CYP2D6 inhibition; the dose should be lowered to prevent toxicity. Paroxetine:\u00a0Similar to fluoxetine, paroxetine raises risperidone levels, which may require dose adjustments. Carbamazepine: Carbamazepine induces CYP3A, potentially lowering risperidone levels; titrate upwards but do not exceed twice the usual dose. Alcohol: Caution is recommended when combining risperidone with other CNS depressants and alcohol due to potential additive effects. Levodopa and dopamine agonists: Risperidone may antagonize the effects of dopamine agonists and levodopa, potentially reducing their efficacy. Methylphenidate: Co-administration with methylphenidate may increase the risk of extrapyramidal symptoms, necessitating monitoring for these symptoms. Clozapine: Chronic use of clozapine may\u00a0reduce the clearance of risperidone, which could require dose adjustments.",

        "title": "[Serotonin antagonism involved in the antipsychotic effect. Confirmation with ritanserine and risperidone].",
        "content": "Shortly after the introduction of the first neuroleptics a serotonin hypothesis of schizophrenia has been proposed. But neuroleptics in animals and in man were found to produce effects more consistently related to inhibition of the dopaminergic than of any other type of neurotransmission. However, two early neuroleptics, pipamperone and clozapine, act pharmacologically more on 5-HT2 than on D2 receptors. Both have a distinct clinical profile and low EPS liability. The development of selective 5-HT2-antagonists, devoid of LSD-like properties, resulted in a first compound, ritanserin. Clinically, the highly specific 5-HT2-antagonism of ritanserin improves dysthymia, increases slow wave sleep and supports classical neuroleptic treatment by decreasing negative symptoms and EPS. These properties, being valuable by themselves, have been associated to dopamine D2-antagonism in the new antipsychotic risperidone, which is an extremely potent 5-HT2-antagonist. At doses of 5 mg daily risperidone acts on both negative and positive symptoms of schizophrenia in the virtual absence of EPS.",
