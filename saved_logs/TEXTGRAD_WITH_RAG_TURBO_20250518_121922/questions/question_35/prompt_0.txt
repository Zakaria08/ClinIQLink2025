Document 1 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): A 21-year-old woman comes with her parents to discuss therapeutic options for her Crohn’s disease. She was diag-nosed with Crohn’s disease 2 years ago, and it involves her terminal ileum and proximal colon, as confirmed by colonoscopy and small bowel radiography. She was initially treated with mesalamine and budesonide with good response, but over the last 2 months, she has had a relapse of her symptoms. She is experiencing fatigue, cramping, abdominal pains, and nonbloody diarrhea up to 10 times daily, and she has had a 15-lb weight loss. She has no other significant medical or surgical his-tory. Her current medications are mesalamine 2.4 g/d and budesonide 9 mg/d. She appears thin and tired. Abdominal examination reveals tenderness without guarding in the right lower quadrant; no masses are palpable. On perianal examination, there is no tenderness, fissure, or fistula. Her laboratory data are notable for anemia and elevated C-reactive protein. What are the options for immediate
Document 2 (Title: Risperidone -- Adverse Effects -- Drug-Drug Interactions): Fluoxetine: Fluoxetine increases risperidone levels due to CYP2D6 inhibition; the dose should be lowered to prevent toxicity. Paroxetine: Similar to fluoxetine, paroxetine raises risperidone levels, which may require dose adjustments. Carbamazepine: Carbamazepine induces CYP3A, potentially lowering risperidone levels; titrate upwards but do not exceed twice the usual dose. Alcohol: Caution is recommended when combining risperidone with other CNS depressants and alcohol due to potential additive effects. Levodopa and dopamine agonists: Risperidone may antagonize the effects of dopamine agonists and levodopa, potentially reducing their efficacy. Methylphenidate: Co-administration with methylphenidate may increase the risk of extrapyramidal symptoms, necessitating monitoring for these symptoms. Clozapine: Chronic use of clozapine may reduce the clearance of risperidone, which could require dose adjustments.
Document 3 (Title: Management of schizophrenia): Medication The mainstay of treatment for schizophrenia is an antipsychotic medication. Most antipsychotics can take around 7 to 14 days to have their full effect. Medication may improve the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, and social and vocational functioning. However, antipsychotics fail to significantly improve the negative symptoms and cognitive dysfunction. There is evidence of clozapine, amisulpride, olanzapine, and risperidone being the most effective medications. However, a high proportion of studies of risperidone were undertaken by its manufacturer, Janssen-Cilag, and should be interpreted with this in mind. In those on antipsychotics, continued use decreases the risk of relapse. There is little evidence regarding consistent benefits from their use beyond two or three years.

What is the most appropriate initial step in managing the condition of a 19-year-old woman presenting with specific symptoms, accompanied by her parents?

Options:
A. Intravenous hydration
B. Paracetamol
C. Stop risperidone
D. Switch risperidone to clozapine
