        "title": "[Acupuncture in the combined treatment of patients with unilateral paralysis of the recurrent laryngeal nerve].",
        "content": "Fourteen patients with unilateral paralysis of the recurrent laryngeal nerve underwent a combined therapy which included acupuncture, phonopedics, respiratory muscle gymnastics, prozerin administration by means of sinusoidal modulated currents, and intramuscular injection of B1 and B6 vitamins. Before and after treatment the vocal function was assessed using indirect laryngoscopy, laryngostroboscopy, larynx tomography and thermography, larynx endophotography, voice tape recording, and maximum phonation time measurement. The combined treatment yielded good results in all patients in terms of the recovery of their vocal function. In 11 patients the recovery was reached within 2-3 weeks and in 3 remaining patients within 2-3 months. It is maintained that the recovery was expedited due to the beneficial effect of acupuncture and phonopedics.",

        "content": "The combination of acupuncture and medical training therapy produced positive effects on depression, anxiety, and quality of life and was observed to be safe and effective for treating frequent episodic or chronic TTH. [57] [58] [59] The 8-week true acupuncture treatment was effective for chronic TTH prophylaxis. [60] However, low- to moderate-quality evidence\u00a0indicates that neuromodulation, acupuncture, and aerobic exercises are related to attenuated headache symptoms among patients with episodic migraine or TTH.",

        "title": "Tension headache",
        "content": "Chronic Classes of medications involved in treatment of CTTH include tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), SSRIs, benzodiazepine (Clonazepam in small evening dose), and muscle relaxants. The most commonly utilized TCA is amitriptyline due to the postulated role in decreasing central sensitization and analgesic relief. Another popular TCA used is Doxepine. SSRIs may also be utilized for management of CTTH. For patients with concurrent muscle spasm and CTTH, the muscle relaxant Tizanidine can be a helpful option. These medications however, are not effective if concurrent overuse of over the counter medications or other analgesics is occurring. Stopping overuse must occur prior to proceeding with other forms of treatment. Manual therapy Current evidence for acupuncture is slight. A 2016 systematic review suggests better evidence among those with frequent tension headaches, but concludes that further trials comparing acupuncture with other treatment options are needed.",
