Document 1 (Title: Total Laryngectomy -- Anatomy and Physiology -- Function of the Larynx): The larynx represents the cephalad aperture of the respiratory tree, joining the upper digestive tract in the oropharynx. Three laryngeal structures protect the trachea and lower airways: the true vocal folds, the false vocal folds, and the epiglottis. The true and false vocal folds abduct during inhalation and exhalation to minimize airflow turbulence and maximize air exchange. Sensory branches of the superior laryngeal nerve create a cough reflex, rapidly closing the true and false vocal folds and increasing intra-thoracic pressure with any unexpected stimulation of the supraglottis or glottis during respiration. This helps prevent foreign material from passing into the lower airways. [8] The larynx elevates during deglutition, allowing the epiglottis to act as a cap overtop of the laryngeal inlet and diverting oropharyngeal contents laterally and posteriorly into the pyriform sinuses and cervical esophagus, decreasing the likelihood of material passing into the larynx inlet and lower airway. This also allows the vocal folds to remain open even when swallowing if normal sensation is intact, facilitating the suck-swallow-breathe pattern seen in nursing infants. [9]
Document 2 (Title: The treatment of tension headache by acupuncture: a controlled single case design with time series analysis.): A single case design, with time series analysis, was employed to evaluate the efficacy of acupuncture in the treatment of tension headache. Fourteen patients were given eight weekly treatments, four of true acupuncture and four of sham in random order. Mean pain in medication scores were reduced by 52% and 54% respectively at initial follow-up. Reductions in pain scores of over 50% were achieved by half the patients and the significance of these changes confirmed by time series analysis. The majority of patients maintained their gains at four month follow-up. True acupuncture was shown to be significantly superior to sham, demonstrating a specific therapeutic action, in four patients. In the remainder no difference was observed. Possible mechanisms for these effects are discussed. Acupuncture is a potentially valuable treatment for tension headache but further research is needed.
Document 3 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): for seeking complementary and alternative treatments. The most common of these for back pain are spinal manipulation, acupuncture, and massage. The role of most complementary and alternative medicine approaches remains unclear. Biofeedback has not been studied rigorously. There is no convincing evidence that either spinal manipulation or transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is effective in treating CLBP. Rigorous recent trials of acupuncture suggest that true acupuncture is not superior to sham acupuncture, but that both may offer an advantage over routine care. Whether this is due entirely to placebo effects provided even by sham acupuncture is uncertain. Some trials of massage therapy have been encouraging, but this has been less well studied than spinal manipulation or acupuncture. Various injections, including epidural glucocorticoid injections, facet joint injections, and trigger point injections, have been used for treating CLBP. However, in the absence of
