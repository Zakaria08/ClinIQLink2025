Document 1 (Title: Spatial properties of goldfish ganglion cells.): We systematically classified goldfish ganglion cells according to their spatial summation properties using the same techniques and criteria used in cat and monkey research. Results show that goldfish ganglion cells can be classified as X-, Y-, or W-like based on their responses to contrast-reversal gratings. Like cat X cells, goldfish X-like cells display linear spatial summation. Goldfish Y-like cells, like cat Y cells, respond with frequency doubling at all spatial positions when the contrast-reversal grating consists of high spatial frequencies. There is also a third class of neurons, which is neither X- nor Y-like; many of these cells' properties are similar to those of the "not-X" cells found in the eel retina. Spatial filtering characteristics were obtained for each cell by drifting sinusoidal gratings of various spatial frequencies and contrasts across the receptive field of the cell at a constant temporal rate. The spatial tuning curves of the cell depend on the temporal parameters of the stimulus; at high drift rates, the tuning curves lose their low spatial frequency attenuation. To explore this phenomenon, temporal contrast response functions were derived from the cells' responses to a spatially uniform field whose luminance varied sinusoidally in time. These functions were obtained for the center, the surround, and the entire receptive field. The results suggest that differences in the cells' spatial filtering across stimulus drift rate are due to changes in the interaction of the center and surround mechanisms; at low temporal frequencies, the center and surround responses are out-of-phase and mutually antagonistic, but at higher temporal rates their responses are in-phase and their interaction actually enhances the cell's responsiveness.
Document 2 (Title: Meningococcal Vaccine -- Mechanism of Action): To date, worldwide, there are 12 known distinct meningococcal serogroups designated based on the composition of CPS polymers (A, B, C, E, H, I, K, L, W, X, Y, and Z), with serogroups A, B, C, W, Y, and X, being responsible for the majority of disease. These 12 serogroups differ immunologically due to characteristic differences in their polysaccharide capsule; serotype menW correlates with more severe clinical manifestations and higher fatality rates than the rest, with more estimated outbreaks and disease clusters worldwide. These polysaccharides form the basis of production for the current vaccines, except for serogroup X and B, for which no vaccine is available, and the MenB vaccine's basis is on its outer membrane polysaccharides, respectively. [3] [6] [7] [14] [15] We know two types of meningococcal vaccines: (1) polysaccharide and (2) conjugated polysaccharide vaccines. [12]
