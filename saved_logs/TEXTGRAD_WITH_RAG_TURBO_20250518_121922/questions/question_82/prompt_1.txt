Document 1 (Title: Intracranial aneurysm): Subarachnoid bleed If an aneurysm ruptures, blood leaks into the space around the brain. This is called a subarachnoid hemorrhage. Onset is usually sudden without prodrome, classically presenting as a "thunderclap headache" worse than previous headaches. Symptoms of a subarachnoid hemorrhage differ depending on the site and size of the aneurysm. Symptoms of a ruptured aneurysm can include: a sudden severe headache that can last from several hours to days nausea and vomiting drowsiness, confusion and/or loss of consciousness visual abnormalities meningism dizziness Almost all aneurysms rupture at their apex. This leads to hemorrhage in the subarachnoid space and sometimes in brain parenchyma. Minor leakage from aneurysm may precede rupture, causing warning headaches. About 60% of patients die immediately after rupture. Larger aneurysms have a greater tendency to rupture, though most ruptured aneurysms are less than 10 mm in diameter.
Document 2 (Title: Left Ventricular False Aneurysm -- Differential Diagnosis): Left ventricular true aneurysms merit consideration as this can mimic false aneurysms (see Image. Left Ventricular Aneurysm, Ultrasound). This is a relatively frequent complication compared to false aneurysms and occurs in 10% to 35% of patients following myocardial infarction. [17] Differentiating can often be difficult pre-operatively. Unlike a false aneurysm, a true aneurysm contains all 3 layers of the myocardial wall. A true aneurysm is an abnormal left ventricular diastolic contour with systolic dyskinesia or paradoxical bulging, leading to decreased ejection fraction. True aneurysms tend to be on the anterior or apical segments, whereas false aneurysms are more common posteriorly. [9] True aneurysms are generally non-contractile and have a thinned myocardium. Upon evaluation, the neck of the true aneurysm was not seen to be narrower than the size of the cavity. These patients have a much lower risk of rupture than false aneurysms and thus can be managed medically or surgically. [18] Patients with symptoms of angina, arrhythmias, or heart failure benefit from surgical repair. During surgery, true aneurysms can be seen to collapse fully during left ventricular decompression.
Document 3 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): The impact of age on risk was present across all operations but had most impact in liver and rectal surgery. Surgeons are challenged to decide whether major sur-gery is justified in older adult patients, especially those with limited life expectancy. Effectiveness of oncologic surgery in older adult patients depends on whether a cure can be achieved safely without compromise to functional status or quality of life. Postoperative life expectancy should be improved by surgery, or, at the very least, not diminished.Emergency SurgeryEmergent surgery caries exceptionally high risk for older adult patients. In an analysis of patients age 90 years and older, 90-day mortality after emergency gastrointestinal procedures was 54%.71 In a large cohort of patients undergoing endovas-cular repair for ruptured aortic aneurysm, 30-day mortality was 35% after primary aortic repair and 52% after open conversion of endovascular aortic repair.72Frail institutionalized elders are at substantial risk for

Is it medically advisable and ethically justified to perform aneurysm repair on patients aged 80 or older after experiencing an aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage?
