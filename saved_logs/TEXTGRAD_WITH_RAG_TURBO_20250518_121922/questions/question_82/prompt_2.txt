Document 1 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): been any randomized studies to evaluate their effectiveness. The prognosis depends on the severity of neurologic deficit but is generally good in extracranial dissections. The recurrence rate is low. Therapeutic interventions have been reserved for recurrent TIAs or strokes or failure of medical treatment. Endovascular options include intra-arterial stenting, coiling of associated pseudoaneurysms, or, more recently, deployment of covered stents.Figure 23-25.

Document 2 (Title: Anesthesia for intracranial aneurysm surgery.): Aneurysmal rupture represents the most common cause of subarachnoid hemorrhage. Approximately two-thirds of persons who experience a subarachnoid hemorrhage will die or become disabled. Although advances in neurosurgical techniques, neuroanesthetic management, and neuroradiology have resulted in great progress in reducing the operative risk for patients with intracranial aneurysms, the overall outcome following subarachnoid hemorrhage remains disappointing. This article provides an overview of some current concepts related to the perioperative management of patients with intracranial aneurysms, such as the risk and management of rebleeding and vasospasm, and considerations related to the timing of surgery. The anesthetic management of these patients is reviewed, emphasizing principles relating to the facilitation of surgery--by optimizing operative conditions and minimizing the risks of intraoperative aneurysmal rupture or the aggravation of neurologic deficits--and to the provision of a smooth, stable recovery. Despite the disappointing overall prognosis following subarachnoid hemorrhage, adherence to these principles can optimize the outcome for those patients who reach the operating room.
Document 3 (Title: Intracranial aneurysm): Subarachnoid bleed If an aneurysm ruptures, blood leaks into the space around the brain. This is called a subarachnoid hemorrhage. Onset is usually sudden without prodrome, classically presenting as a "thunderclap headache" worse than previous headaches. Symptoms of a subarachnoid hemorrhage differ depending on the site and size of the aneurysm. Symptoms of a ruptured aneurysm can include: a sudden severe headache that can last from several hours to days nausea and vomiting drowsiness, confusion and/or loss of consciousness visual abnormalities meningism dizziness Almost all aneurysms rupture at their apex. This leads to hemorrhage in the subarachnoid space and sometimes in brain parenchyma. Minor leakage from aneurysm may precede rupture, causing warning headaches. About 60% of patients die immediately after rupture. Larger aneurysms have a greater tendency to rupture, though most ruptured aneurysms are less than 10 mm in diameter.

Is it medically advisable and ethically justified to conduct aneurysm surgery on patients aged 80 or older who have experienced an aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage?
