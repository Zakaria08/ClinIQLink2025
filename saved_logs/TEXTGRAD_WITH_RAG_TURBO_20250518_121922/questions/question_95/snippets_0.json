Enrollees in a POS plan are required to choose a primary care physician (PCP) from within the health care network; this PCP becomes their \"point of service\".

If the patient chooses to go outside the network, it is the patient's responsibility to fill out forms, send bills in for payment, and keep an accurate account of health care receipts. References",
