With your own knowledge and the help of the following document:

Document 1 (Title: Managed Care -- Definition/Introduction): The types of managed care insurance or benefit management approaches have also evolved. Initially, managed care was synonymous with a health maintenance organization or HMO approach. [6] In the traditional HMO model, patients enrolled select a primary care provider (PCP) who receives a PMPM to provide care and coordinate all services for that patient. The PCP serves as the patient’s gatekeeper for all necessary services and must provide a referral for the patient to be seen by a subspecialist or to receive imaging or laboratory studies. The PCP is expected to manage and oversee the care so that only appropriate care and services are provided according to available evidence or consistent with standardized care pathways. Only network providers are available to the patient in an HMO, so specialists, hospitals, pharmacies, imaging centers, and laboratories are preselected, credentialed, and contracted by the HMO. In the case of an HMO with a gatekeeper model, coverage is only available for care and services authorized by their PCP.
Document 2 (Title: HMOs for Medicaid: the road to financial independence is often poorly paved.): During the 1980s both the federal government and the private sector articulated policies to encourage the development and participation of health maintenance organizations (HMOs) in the Medicaid program. However, the policies, intended to save costs, limited the ability of new HMOs to achieve financial independence. New plans that emphasize Medicaid participation have few, if any, options on benefit design or in setting capitation rates. Relative to fee-for-service Medicaid programs, their costs to provide services may be quite high, as they have neither the buying power not the ability to impose discounts. As a consequence, plans must focus their financial planning efforts on targeting and attaining a stable enrollment base and on controlling the amount of services provided, tasks that are difficult for all HMOs. Achieving a stable enrollment base is particularly hard because Medicaid eligibles have few incentives to enroll and once enrolled often lose their Medicaid eligibility. Traditional HMOs control the amount of services provided through physician selection, financial incentives on physicians, and monitoring and utilization review. Lack of information and the difficulty inherent in attracting sufficient provider participation limit the first two strategies, so new plans often adopt organization structures that rely heavily on monitoring activities. Unfortunately, management information systems for HMOs are often the weakest link. We discuss the tasks and present data on financial planning, on putting financial plans into operation, and on monitoring progress toward financial independence for a set of ten demonstration projects sponsored by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.
