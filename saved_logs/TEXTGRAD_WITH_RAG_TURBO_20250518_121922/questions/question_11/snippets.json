        "title": "Carotid-cavernous fistula",
        "content": "A carotid-cavernous fistula results from an abnormal communication between the arterial and venous systems within the cavernous sinus in the skull. It is a type of arteriovenous fistula. As arterial blood under high pressure enters the cavernous sinus, the normal venous return to the cavernous sinus is impeded and this causes engorgement of the draining veins, manifesting most dramatically as a sudden engorgement and redness of the eye of the same side. Presentation CCF symptoms include bruit (a humming sound within the skull due to high blood flow through the arteriovenous fistula), progressive visual loss, and pulsatile proptosis or progressive bulging of the eye due to dilatation of the veins draining the eye. Pain is the symptom that patients often find the most difficult to tolerate. Patients usually present with sudden or insidious onset of redness in one eye, associated with progressive proptosis or bulging.They may have a history of similar episodes in the past.",

        "content": "JP is a 33-year-old woman who presents with complaints of fatigue requiring daytime naps, weight gain, cold intoler-ance, and muscle weakness for the last few months. These complaints are new since she used to always feel \u201chot,\u201d noted difficulty sleeping, and could eat anything that she wanted without gaining weight. She also would like to become preg-nant in the near future. Because of poor medication adherence to methimazole and propranolol, she received radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy, developed hypothyroidism, and was started on levothyroxine 100 mcg daily. Other medications include calcium carbonate three times daily to \u201cprotect her bones\u201d and omeprazole for \u201cheartburn.\u201d On physical exami-nation, her blood pressure is 130/89 mm Hg with a pulse of 50 bpm. Her weight is 136 lb (61.8 kg), an increase of 10 lb (4.5 kg) in the last year. Her thyroid gland is not palpable and her reflexes are delayed. Laboratory findings include a thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level of 24.9 \u03bcIU/mL",

On the other hand, so called the external carotid avernous fistula has been recognized less 20 cases in literature. We have observed three additional cases of dural arteriovenous shunts in the region of the cavernous sinus. Case 1. A 52 year old woman had suffered from left side sever headache. There was weakness of the left extraocular muscles and left ptosis. A bruit was heard over the left orbit. She was treated for hypertension since 38 year old. And she has no history of recent trauma. Selective internal and external carotid angiographies showed the bilateral external carotid cavernous sinus fistula. No operative treatment was performed in this case and the symptomes disappeared with decrease of blood pressure. Case 2. A 50 year old man came to this clinic with chief complaints of right ptosis, diplopia and headache. He was treated for diabetes mellitus and hypertension for six month...",

Skin, conjunctival, and corneal sensation, along with any lid lag, should also be documented. Findings such as tortuous conjunctival vessels or choroidal-retinal folds may point towards orbital pathology.\u00a0For the measurement of ptosis, the margin-to-reflex distance, which is the distance in millimeters between the corneal light reflex to the upper eyelid (MRD1) or lower eyelid (MRD2), can be used to measure eyelid positioning, ptosis, lagophthalmos, ectropion, and scleral show. A complete cranial nerve examination is required, with special attention paid to V1, V2, V3, and any pain with ocular movements. Unilateral proptosis points more towards primary or secondary orbital pathology rather than a systemic disease like Graves ophthalmopathy. Asymmetry of >2 mm between the prominence of the\u00a02 eyes is considered significant. Palpation may reveal a firm globe with restricted mobility, which is worrisome for orbital malignancy.
