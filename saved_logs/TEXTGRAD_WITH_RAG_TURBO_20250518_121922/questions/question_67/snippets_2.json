        "content": "Beyond the key parts of the physical screening examination, including vital signs, a patient's mental status must be examined to make a diagnostic determination. It begins with the patient's appearance - gait,\u00a0appropriateness of dress, and tattoos, especially any depicting violence. Attitude, behavior, and movements during the interview\u00a0should be noted, including cooperativeness, handshake, pacing, eye contact, and arm and leg movements. Speech is very important. This includes speech rate, tone, and relatedness. Emotional content includes mood and affect. M ood is\u00a0a patient's description of how they feel, often quoted in records. Affect is the interviewer's assessment of the patient's emotions. Thought Content is about how the patient is thinking and deals with 3 areas. Hallucinations are false perceptions of one of the five senses based on no external stimulus. These are real to the patient. Olfactory is smelling; Gustatory is tasting; Tractile is feeling; Visual is seeing; and Auditory is hearing. Command hallucinations are usually auditory. For example, a patient may report God is telling them to kill someone. Delusions are false beliefs held against logic and cultural norms. An example of a grandiose delusion may be a belief that a patient is God, or has solved the problem of world poverty. \u00a0A paranoid delusion may include the belief that the FBI is out to get me and I must kill them first. Illusions are false ideas based on some type of stimulus that is misinterpreted. A patient may see a shadow and believe that a ghost is chasing them, as an example of an illusion. Suicide involves ideas and plans to kill oneself. Homicidal ideation involves ideas and plans to harm or kill others. Intellect means an assessment of the individual's intelligence based on their speech content, process, and how they relate to others. Judgment involves patient decision-making. Choosing to be violent can indicate poor patient judgment. Then there are a series of cognitive assessments. There is orientation to time, place, and person. There is immediate, recent, and distant recall. Serial 7s involves asking a patient to count backward from 100 by 7s (100, 93, 86, etc.). Finally, there are interpretations of proverbs such as asking the patient what \"don't change horses midstream\" means.",

        "title": "Variation in restorative treatment decisions: application of Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (ROC) analysis.",
        "content": "It has been evident for many years that dentists, when planning treatment for patients, do not act in a standard manner, and previous research has shown there to be wide variations in treatment planning amongst groups of dentists. Signal detection theory and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis allows measurement of an observer's ability to detect a lesion, while at the same time allowing examination of how a lesion, once perceived, is judged to be in need of treatment. An ROC curve is constructed by plotting the sensitivity (or true positive rate) of decisions made, against the false positive rate (equivalent to 1-specificity) when various decision attitudes, from interventionist to non-interventionist, are held. Fifteen pairs of simulated bitewing radiographs were shown to 20 dentists, who were asked to specify, for each approximal lesion, whether or not they would place a conventional restoration. The 7200 decisions made by the dentists were validated by sectioning and microscopically examining the teeth. The mean sensitivity of the dentists' decisions, when the strictest operating thresholds were held and caries into dentine was the validating criterion, was 0.26 and the mean specificity was 0.96. ROC analysis shows that when operating at the strictest threshold, the dentists were implying that specificity was weighted as being 2.7 times more important than sensitivity. ROC analysis leads to insight into how dentists differentially weight the true and false, positive and negative, outcomes of their decisions and thus allows explanation of why two dentists would rarely make exactly the same treatment plan for one patient, and also why different treatments might be offered to two patients exhibiting the same levels of disease.",
