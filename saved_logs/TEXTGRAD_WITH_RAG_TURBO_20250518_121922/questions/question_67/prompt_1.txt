Document 1 (Title: Popper's three worlds): Central to Popper's overall theory of knowledge is his contention that a form of "making and matching" or "conjecture and refutation" is the model by which knowledge develops at all these levels i.e. within World 1, and within World 2, and also as regards knowledge arising from World 2's interactions with World 1 and World 3. Popper's theory of knowledge is very different to the view that identifies knowledge with some form of "justified true belief", and he argues, by contrast, that:- (a) all knowledge is conjectural, because it always might be mistaken, and none is "justified" in the sense philosophers usually mean i.e. of having an infallible basis; (b) knowledge encompasses what is false as well as what is true e.g. Newton's physics, though strictly false, is highly significant knowledge - much more significant than knowledge that is true but trivial;

Document 3 (Title: [Analysis of the attitude of the hospital staff regarding the hepatitis B vaccine].): The attitude of the staff of the University Hospital Virgen de la Macarena in Sevilla was evaluated to assess their degree of information about hepatitis B vaccine, their attitude towards vaccination and the possible causes of the latter. To this end, a survey was carried out among 200 individuals from the hospital staff, distributed in four professional level categories (doctors, nurses, clinical assistants and attendants). The level of knowledge of the disease, the participation in the vaccination and the future attitude were evaluated. Group differences were also analysed. The results showed a low information level about the vaccine (81.5% were not adequately informed), a low vaccination index (13.5%) and a low intention to be vaccinated in the future (34.6%), mostly due to poor information.

What are the common knowledge gaps and attitudes among unvaccinated seniors regarding vaccinations?
