        "title": "Differential effects of the 1,4 and 1,5 benzodiazepines on performance in healthy man.",
        "content": "1 The immediate and residual effects on performance of benzodiazepines differ, and the differences are important in the use of these drugs. 2. Diazepam and its hydroxylated metabolites, temazepam and oxazepam, each possess hypnotic activity, and have effects on performance limited to the sleep period. The demethylated metabolite of diazepam, nordiazepam, and its precursor, potassium clorazepate, which also possess hypnotic activity, have a longer duration of action, although the next day anxiolytic effect is accompanied by only minimal effects on performance. The 1.5 benzodiazepine, clobazam, seems to have minimal immediate effects on performance. 3 Diazepam and its hydroxylated metabolites, temazepam and oxazepam, would be useful in the management of insomnia without psychopathology in those cases in which residual effects on performance must be avoided. Nordiazepam and potassium clorazepate would be appropriate for insomnia secondary to day-time anxiety, and clobazam may be useful as a day-time anxiolytic. 4 It is emphasized that more work needs to be carried out on the effects of anxiolytics on performance before one can be certain that ingestion during the day would be without any deleterious effects on skilled work.",

        "content": "Diazepam is an anxiolytic benzodiazepine, first patented and marketed in the United States in 1963. It is a fast-acting, long-lasting benzodiazepine commonly used to treat anxiety disorders and alcohol detoxification, acute recurrent seizures, severe muscle spasms, and spasticity associated with neurologic disorders. In acute alcohol withdrawal, diazepam is useful for symptomatic relief of agitation, tremor, alcoholic hallucinosis, and acute delirium tremens. [1] Benzodiazepines have largely replaced barbiturates in treating anxiety and sleep disorders because of their improved safety profile, fewer side effects, and flumazenil(antagonist)\u00a0availability that can reverse oversedation\u00a0in cases of benzodiazepine intoxication.

        "title": "Pinazepam",
        "content": "Pinazepam differs from other benzodiazepines in that it has a propargyl group at the N-1 position of the benzodiazepine structure. It is less toxic than diazepam and in animal studies it appears to produce anxiolytic and anti-agitation properties with limited hypnotic and motor coordination impairing properties. Pinazepam is rapidly absorbed after oral administration. The main active metabolites of pinazepam are depropargylpinazepam (N-desmethyldiazepam, nordazepam) and oxazepam. In humans pinazepam acts as a pure anxiolytic agent in that it does not possess to any significant degree the other pharmacological characteristics of benzodiazepines. Its lack of intellectual, motor and hypnotic impairing effects makes it more appropriate than other benzodiazepines for day time use. The elimination half-life is longer in the elderly.
