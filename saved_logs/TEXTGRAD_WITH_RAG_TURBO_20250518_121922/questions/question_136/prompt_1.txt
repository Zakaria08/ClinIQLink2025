Document 1 (Title: Reactions between primary and secondary acceptors of photosystem II in Chlorella pyrenoidosa under anaerobic conditions as studied by chlorophyll fluorescence.): The kinetics of the fluorescence yield phi of chlorophyll a in Chlorella pyrenoidosa were studied under anaerobic conditions in the time range from 50 mus to several minutes after short (t 1/2 = 30 ns or 5 mus) saturating flashes. The fluorescence yield "in the dark" increased from phi = 1 at the beginning to phi approximately 5 in about 3 h when single flashes separated by dark intervals of about 3 min were given. After one saturating flash, phi increased to a maximum value (4-5) at 50 mus, then phi decreased to about 3 with a half time of about 10 ms and to the initial value with a half time of about 2 s. When two flashes separated by 0.2 s were given, the first phase of the decrease after the second flash occurred within 2 ms. After one flash given at high initial fluorescence yield, the 10-ms decay was followed by a 10 s increase to the initial value. After the two flashes 0.2 s apart, the rapid decay was not followed by a slow increase. These and other experiments provided additional evidence for and extend an earlier hypothesis concerning the acceptor complex of Photosystem II (Bouges-Bocquet, B. (1973) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 314, 250-256; Velthuys, B. R. and Amesz. J. (1974) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 333, 85-94): reaction center 2 contains an acceptor complex QR consisting of an electron-transferring primary acceptor molecule Q, and a secondary electron acceptor R, which can accept two electrons in succession, but transfers two electrons simultaneously to a molecule of the tertiary acceptor pool, containing plastoquinone (A). Furthermore, the kinetics indicate that 2 reactions centers of System I, excited by a short flash, cooperate directly or indirectly in oxidizing a plastohydroquinone molecule (A2-). If initially all components between photoreaction 1 and 2 are in the reduced state the following sequence of reactions occurs after a flash has oxidised A2- via System I: Q-R2- + A leads to Q-R + A2- leads to QR- + A2-. During anaerobiosis two slow reactions manifest themselves: the reduction of R (and A) within 1 s, presumably by an endogenous electron donor D1, and the reduction of Q in about 10 s when R is in the state R- and A in the state A2-. An endogenous electron donor, D2, and Q- complete in reducing the photooxidized donor complex of System II in reactions with half times of the order of 1 s.
Document 2 (Title: Enzyme assay): Fluorometric Fluorescence is when a molecule emits light of one wavelength after absorbing light of a different wavelength. Fluorometric assays use a difference in the fluorescence of substrate from product to measure the enzyme reaction. These assays are in general much more sensitive than spectrophotometric assays, but can suffer from interference caused by impurities and the instability of many fluorescent compounds when exposed to light. An example of these assays is again the use of the nucleotide coenzymes NADH and NADPH. Here, the reduced forms are fluorescent and the oxidised forms non-fluorescent. Oxidation reactions can therefore be followed by a decrease in fluorescence and reduction reactions by an increase. Synthetic substrates that release a fluorescent dye in an enzyme-catalyzed reaction are also available, such as 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-D-galactoside for assaying β-galactosidase or 4-methylumbelliferyl-butyrate for assaying Candida rugosa lipase.

Document 3 (Title: Cell_Biology_Alberts): Figure 9–12 Fluorescence and the fluorescence microscope. (a) an orbital electron of a fluorochrome molecule can be raised to an excited state following the absorption of a photon. Fluorescence occurs when the electron returns to its ground state and emits a photon of light at a longer wavelength. too much exposure to light, or too bright a light, can also destroy the fluorochrome molecule, in a process called photobleaching. (B) in the fluorescence microscope, a filter set consists of two barrier filters (1 and 3) and a dichroic (beam-splitting) mirror (2). this example shows the filter set for detection of the fluorescent molecule fluorescein. high-numerical-aperture objective lenses are especially important in this type of microscopy because, for a given magnification, the brightness of the fluorescent image is proportional to the fourth power of the numerical aperture Figure 9–14 Different fluorescent probes can be visualized in the same cell. in this composite micrograph of a
