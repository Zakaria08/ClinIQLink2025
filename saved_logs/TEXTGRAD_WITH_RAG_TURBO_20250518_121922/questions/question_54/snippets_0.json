        "content": "When a portion of the intestinal tract is forcefully pulled from or expelled from the body through the anus, it is referred to as transanal evisceration. Following the first report of transanal evisceration by Brodie in 1827, more than 70 cases have been reported to date, the majority occurring spontaneously in elderly individuals. Straining, chronic constipation, and rectal ulcerations predispose to spontaneous perforation in elderly individuals. Cases of transanal evisceration of children whilst sitting over uncovered swimming pool drains have been reported; notable cases include Valerie Lakey (1993) and Abigail Taylor (2007). In Taylor's case, the suction dislodged and damaged her liver and pancreas; several meters of her small intestine were forcefully pulled through her anus. In both these cases, the victims were left with short bowel syndrome and required feeding by total parenteral nutrition. After multiple operations, Taylor later died from transplant-related cancer.",

        "title": "Glossectomy -- Technique or Treatment -- Transcervical Pull-Through Glossectomy Approach",
        "content": "Glossectomy via transcervical pull-through is an alternative resection technique to transoral glossectomy and lip-split mandibulotomy. This approach is a combined transoral/transcervical technique whereby the tongue, floor of the mouth, and the sublingual compartment are released through the submental and submandibular compartments into the neck. Compared to transoral glossectomy alone, this technique provides better exposure for a posterior resection. Transoral glossectomy can be converted to a pull-through without adding a significant time to the procedure. The exposure is not as wide as the lip-split mandibulotomy. However, transcervical pull-through does not require a mandibular osteotomy, thus avoiding the added procedure time for mandibular reconstruction and its associated complications. Flap inset requires thoughtful and disciplined closure to reduce the risk of a postoperative fistula.",

        "content": "In all cases, it is critical that the level at which ganglion-ated bowel exists be determined. Most surgeons believe that the anastomosis should be performed at least 5 cm from the point at which ganglion cells are found. This avoids performing a pull-through in the transition zone, which is associated with a high incidence of complications due to inadequate emptying of the pull-through segment. Up to one-third of patients who undergo a transition zone pull through will require a reoperation.The main complications of all procedures include post-operative enterocolitis, constipation, and anastomotic stricture. There is also a reported incidence of recurrent Hirschsprung\u2019s disease, which may reflect either residual aganglionic bowel left behind after the pull-through, or the presence of ischemia in the pulled-through segment leading to ganglion cell loss. Long-term results with the three procedures are comparable and generally excellent in experienced hands. These three procedures also",
