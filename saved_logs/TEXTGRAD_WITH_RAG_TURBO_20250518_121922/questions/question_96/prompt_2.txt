Document 1 (Title: Single staged carotid and coronary arteries surgery. Indications and results.): The frequency of associated carotid and coronary stenosis is estimated to be 40% of cases including asymptomatic patients. The risk of death by myocardial infarction during carotid surgery is in the neighborhood of 1%. With Doppler and ultrasonic imaging, it is now possible to recognize carotid stenosis in 11% of these cases. Depending on the extent of the clinical manifestations caused by one or the other of these lesions, there are several therapeutic options: surgery of the carotid with special protection of the myocardium during and after surgery or simultaneous carotid and coronary surgery in high risk cases. Between 1979 and 1986, simultaneous surgery was performed in 18 cases in our department. During the same period, 1194 carotid endarterectomies and 505 coronary bypasses were performed. These 18 cases included 13 males and 5 females with a mean age of 62 years (range: 43 to 78 years). The procedure performed in these cases were 17 carotid endarterectomies, one bypass of the innominate artery and an average of 2 aorto-coronary bypasses per patient. One death from myocardial infarction occurred in the immediate postoperative period and another patient died suddenly 8 months later. The evolution of arterial disease was evaluated in the other patients. Simultaneous carotid and coronary artery surgery is indicated in high risk carotid and coronary patients. Perusal of the results in the literature allows a better appreciation of the indications and risks of this type of surgery. Our series indicates the necessity for a careful preoperative workup in these patients and the need for more accurate screening to obtain better results.
Document 2 (Title: Symptomatic Carotid Artery Stenosis -- Introduction -- Carotid Artery Stenosis and Coronary Artery Disease): Given that carotid stenosis is an atherosclerotic process, it is not surprising that a significant portion of patients with severe carotid stenosis have concurrent coronary artery disease (CAD). In patients who need coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) and who are known to have severe (>70%) but asymptomatic carotid stenosis, the question arises regarding performing CEA before or at the same time as the CABG. A randomized control trial of 185 patients showed significant benefit for CEA either prior to or at the same time as CABG compared to patients who underwent CEA 1 to 3 months after CABG. The delayed CEA group had a significantly increased risk of perioperative or delayed stroke. [10]
Document 3 (Title: Gynecology_Novak): Large-and small-vessel arterial occlusive disease is the single most important risk factor in the preoperative setting. A careful history and physical examination should be performed to determine the presence or absence of coronary artery or cerebral vascular disease (150). When extended surgery is possible, as with surgery for gynecologic cancer, exercise stress testing or dipyridamole-thallium imaging should be considered to rule out occult coronary artery disease. Perioperative beta-blockade should be continued for patients already on beta-blockers at baseline. For patients with inducible ischemia, coronary artery disease, or multiple clinical risk factors for heart disease, perioperative beta-blockade should be considered, with initiation and careful titration of medication several weeks prior to surgery (154,155). Assessment of end-organ disease in the retina, kidney, and carotid arteries or evidence of peripheral vascular disease by the presence of foot ulcers should alert the

Discuss the importance of conducting a thorough preoperative assessment for carotid artery stenosis before performing coronary artery bypass surgery, considering potential complications and benefits.
