        "content": "A high index of clinician suspicion for myxedema coma is important. As discussed above, patients who present will most likely be women in the winter months with a history of thyroid disorders and a precipitating illness. The two most common findings will be altered mental status and hypothermia, along with common findings of hypothyroidism. Other common signs include hyponatremia, hypotension, bradycardia, and hypoventilation. Laboratory results in primary hypothyroidism will show severely low or undetected low serum total T4, free T4, free T3, and elevated TSH. The underlying etiology for most patients is a primary thyroid failure, but secondary, tertiary, and sick euthyroid should be in the differential diagnosis. [48] In euthyroid sick syndrome, TSH will not be as elevated as expected. In a small percentage of patients, central hypothyroidism should be a consideration. In these patients, TSH may be inappropriately low. The method to distinguish central versus primary hypothyroidism is that the associated pituitary hormones will decrease as well. [22]",

        "title": "Screening for thyroid disease in the elderly. Serum free thyroxine and thyrotropin concentrations in a representative population of 81-year-old women and men.",
        "content": "Thyroid function in individuals from a representative population of 81-year olds was evaluated clinically and from assay of serum thyrotropin (TSH) and serum free thyroxine (free T4). Among the 144 men, 2 had markedly abnormal values; L-thyroxine treatment had been prescribed for both, one because of primary hypothyroidism (concentrations at screening were high for TSH and low for free T4) and one because of panhypopituitarism (low free T4 at screening). Among the 250 women, 10 had TSH concentrations greater than 10 mU/L; L-thyroxine therapy had been prescribed for 3 of them. Only 1 non-L-thyroxine treated woman had a high free T4 concentration. She had few clinical signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism (mainly weight loss), and multinodular goiter. Total and free 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine concentrations were normal but her total and free T4 concentrations were high at ages 70, 75 and 79 years, indicating that \"T4-toxicosis\" had been present for at least 11 years without evidence of progression of her hyperthyroidism. The results indicate that clinical signs and symptoms of thyroid disease in the elderly may be too subtle for diagnosis.",

        "title": "Goitre",
        "content": "Signs and symptoms A goitre can present as a palpable or visible enlargement of the thyroid gland at the base of the neck. A goitre, if associated with hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism, may be present with symptoms of the underlying disorder. For hyperthyroidism, the most common symptoms are associated with adrenergic stimulation: tachycardia (increased heart rate), palpitations, nervousness, tremor, increased blood pressure and heat intolerance. Clinical manifestations are often related to hypermetabolism, (increased metabolism), excessive thyroid hormone, an increase in oxygen consumption, metabolic changes in protein metabolism, immunologic stimulation of diffuse goitre, and ocular changes (exophthalmos). Hypothyroid people commonly have poor appetite, cold intolerance, constipation, lethargy and may undergo weight gain. However, these symptoms are often non-specific and make diagnosis difficult.",
