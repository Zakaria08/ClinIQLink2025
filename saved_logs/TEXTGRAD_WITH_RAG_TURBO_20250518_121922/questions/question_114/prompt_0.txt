Document 1 (Title: Subclinical Hypothyroidism -- Introduction): Most individuals have a log-linear relationship between TSH and T4. Still, some individuals can have a nonlinear relationship explaining the normal free T4 with TSH ≥10 mIU/L, while others may have a low T4 level. [4] Various studies have reported the incidence of subclinical hypothyroidism to be estimated at 3% to 10% and increasing to 18% to 20% in older patients, depending on the population studied. [5] [6] The prevalence of subclinical hypothyroidism tends to be higher in women and older adults. [7] Observational studies have shown that subclinical hypothyroidism (with TSH ≥10 mIU/L) correlates with an increased risk of fatal and non-fatal coronary artery disease (CAD) events, congestive heart failure, and fatal stroke. [8] [9] [10]
Document 2 (Title: Iodothyronine deiodinase): Hypothyroidism is a disease diagnosed by decreased levels of serum thyroxine (T4). Presentation in adults leads to decreased metabolism, increased weight gain, and neuropsychiatric complications. During development, hypothyroidism is considered more severe and leads to neurotoxicity as cretinism or other human cognitive disorders, altered metabolism and underdeveloped organs. Medication and environmental exposures can result in hypothyroidism with changes in deiodinase enzyme activity. The drug iopanoic acid (IOP) decreased cutaneous cell proliferation by inhibition of deiodinase enzyme type 1 or 2 reducing the conversion of T4 to T3. The environmental chemical DE-71, a PBDE pentaBDE brominated flame retardant decreased hepatic deiodinase I transcription and enzyme activity in neonatal rats with hypothyroidism.

Document 3 (Title: An interaction between thyroid hormone and nerve growth factor promotes the development of hippocampus, olfactory bulbs and cerebellum: a comparative biochemical study of normal and hypothyroid rats.): The effects of treatment with L-thyroxine (T4;20 ng/g body weight, given subcutaneously on days 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9), 2.5 S nerve growth factor (NGF; 2 ng/mg brain weight, given intracerebroventricularly on days 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9), monoclonal anti-NGF (2 ng/mg wet weight, given intracerebroventricularly on days 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9), and monoclonal anti-NGF receptor (192 IgG; 2 ng/mg wet weight, injected daily from day 1 to day 9) antibodies, separately or together, were studied on the biochemical development of hippocampal formation, olfactory bulbs and cerebellum in 10-day-old and 15-day-old normal and hypothyroid rats. The results provide the following information: (1) CNS structures other than the basal forebrain are sensitive to NGF during early development. (2) Both normal and hypothyroid rats are more sensitive to NGF deprivation than NGF supplementation. (3) The effects of anti-NGF antibodies in normal rats are similar to those induced by anti-NGFr antibodies. (4) NGF alone had little or no effect, but interacts with T4 in promoting cell maturation, especially in hypothyroid rats. (5) Hypothyroid rats are more sensitive to T4 and to T4 plus NGF than are normal ones. (6) The synergistic action of both trophic factors, but not that of T4, tend to disappear at long term in hypothyroid rats. (7) The differential sensitivity of the brain areas to T4, NGF, or both trophic factors correlates with their cell acquisition rate, especially in hypothyroid rats. (8) T4 and NGF together act more markedly (but not exclusively) on the cholinergic structures in both normal and hypothyroid rats. (9) RNA appears to be very sensitive to NGF, especially in hypothyroid rats. In close correlation with preliminary morphological observations, the results clearly demonstrate that an interaction between T4 and NGF regulates the ontogeny of a number of neuronal structures in CNS independently of their neurotransmitter phenotype, but with a regional specificity. The possibilities of accounting for this interaction, in particular the major role of thyroxine, are discussed.
