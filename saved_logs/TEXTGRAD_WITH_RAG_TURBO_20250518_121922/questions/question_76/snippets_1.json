        "content": "The\u00a02 main methods of neuraxial anesthesia during labor and delivery are epidural anesthesia and combined spinal-epidural anesthesia. Epidural anesthesia generally has a slower onset to peak effectiveness at 15\u00a0to 20 minutes\u00a0and provides greater sacral dermatomal coverage with more uniformity in the sensory blockade. Combined spinal-epidural is preferred for initiating analgesia in cases of advanced labor due to its expedited onset in 2\u00a0to 5 minutes. Some practices are performing dural puncture epidural anesthesia in place of combined spinal-epidural. [8] [9] Modern labor analgesia regimens for epidurals typically consist of a combination of a dilute local anesthetic with a low-dose opioid (ie, bupivacaine and fentanyl). The combination of\u00a02 low-dose analgesics reduces the risk of local anesthetic systemic toxicity and a high or total spinal anesthetic (encountered with unintentional intrathecal injection). Hemodynamic effects and placental transfer are minimized via this technique. Dilute local anesthetics help mitigate the risk of motor block, which would necessitate instrumental delivery due to compromised ability to push. Initiation of epidural anesthesia involves a bolus of an amide local anesthetic (ie, bupivacaine or ropivacaine) with a lipid-soluble opioid (ie, fentanyl or hydromorphone). After an initial bolus, maintenance of epidural anesthesia can be obtained through various combinations of techniques, including continuous infusion, intermittent bolus, or patient-controlled bolus. An opioid-only intrathecal dose, such as 25 micrograms of fentanyl, provides excellent analgesia for the first and second stages of labor while maintaining hemodynamic stability. Still, it is associated with a high incidence of pruritis. [10] [8]",

        "content": "Uses Pain relief during childbirth Epidural injections are commonly used to provide pain relief (analgesia) during childbirth. This usually involves epidural injection of a local anesthetic and opioids, commonly called an \"epidural\". This is more effective than oral or intra venal (IV) opioids and other common modalities of analgesia in childbirth. After an epidural is administered, a woman may not feel pain, but may still feel pressure. Epidural clonidine is rarely used but has been extensively studied for management of analgesia during labor.",

        "content": "Despite its severity, the disposition of women towards pain during childbirth is influenced by many complex personal and cultural factors. Such influences may inspire a degree of stoicism towards labour pain which would be extraordinary in other painful circumstances. Nevertheless, the majority of women who deliver in a modern obstetric unit request some form of pharmacological pain relief. An important component of proper antenatal education, therefore, is to provide impartial information about the various analgesic alternatives which are available within each centre. Regimens of analgesia which depend on the systemic absorption of drugs (e.g., parenterally administered opioids; inhalational analgesia) are simple to administer but they have limited efficacy and are commonly associated with unpleasant central side effects. While some innovations in actual drug administration have been introduced, it is unlikely that any further major improvements will be feasible using the systemic approach to analgesia. Epidural analgesia has become established as the most effective and consistently reliable method of providing pain relief in labour. Recent advances have demonstrated that many of the adverse effects traditionally associated with epidural analgesia can be substantially reduced by administering local anaesthetics in smaller doses. It is becoming apparent that additional patient benefits are possible when epidural opioids are also used in combination with local anaesthetics. Techniques which allow the mother to exercise personal control over her epidural analgesia requirements are received more favourably and may help reduce the need for obstetric intervention.",
