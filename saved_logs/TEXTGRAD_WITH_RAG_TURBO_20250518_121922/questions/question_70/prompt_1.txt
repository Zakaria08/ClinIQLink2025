Document 1 (Title: Implementation of a trauma team.): A team approach to the initial assessment, investigation and management of potentially seriously injured patients has been instituted. Team members are alerted through an emergency paging system which is activated when a patient fulfills one of a predetermined list of criteria relating to the injury incident, physiological status of the patients and anatomic injuries. Medical members of the team include surgical, intensive care, anaesthetic, and accident and emergency staff. The surgical representative acts as team co-ordinator. Aspects of the function of the trauma team system were assessed over 4 months during which time 721 injured patients were admitted, 240 patients satisfied the trauma team criteria, and the team was called 152 times. The observed 'false alarm' rate was 38% but the true false alarm rate would have been 46%. Injuries sustained by some patients, who satisfied the criteria but who were not evaluated by the team, were of sufficient severity to justify a greater compliance with the system than was observed at this early stage after its implementation. Although a false alarm rate of 46% is higher than desirable, the number of calls per day would still only average 2 in a hospital with a high trauma patient load. The checklist criteria were highly sensitive (97%) in identifying those patients who should have been evaluated by the trauma team. Although hospitals differ in workload and staffing, this trauma team model is recommended for more widespread use and for further evaluation and modification.
Document 2 (Title: Evolutionary game theory): This is because in the war of attrition any strategy that is unwavering and predictable is unstable, because it will ultimately be displaced by a mutant strategy which relies on the fact that it can best the existing predictable strategy by investing an extra small delta of waiting resource to ensure that it wins. Therefore, only a random unpredictable strategy can maintain itself in a population of bluffers. The contestants in effect choose an acceptable cost to be incurred related to the value of the resource being sought, effectively making a random bid as part of a mixed strategy (a strategy where a contestant has several, or even many, possible actions in their strategy). This implements a distribution of bids for a resource of specific value V, where the bid for any specific contest is chosen at random from that distribution. The distribution (an ESS) can be computed using the Bishop-Cannings theorem, which holds true for any mixed-strategy ESS. The distribution function in
Document 3 (Title: Pediatrics_Nelson): The outcome of drowning is determined by the successof immediate resuscitation efforts and the severity of thehypoxic-ischemic injury to the brain. Patients who have regained consciousness on arrival to the hospital will likelysurvive with intact neurologic function. Unfavorable prognostic markers include the need for CPR for more than 25 minutes, continued CPR at the hospital, Glasgow Coma Scaleof 5 or less, fixed and dilated pupils, seizures, and coma formore than 72 hours. Despite the decreased incidence of drowning since the 1990s, few prevention strategies have been shown to be effective. Exceptions include implementation of mandatory four-sided fencing around pools (decreasing the number of children <5 years of age who drown) and immediate provision of CPR to children who drown. The use of safety flotation devices in older children during water sport activities may be beneficial. Enhanced supervision is required to reduce the incidence of infants drowning in bathtubs.
