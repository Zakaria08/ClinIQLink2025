        "content": "Infants in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) require additional considerations regarding newborn screening. Premature newborns have immature enzymes and metabolic instability, which result in more false-positive results. [6] To ensure appropriate sensitivity, infants in the NICU should be re-screened seven days after admission if they were initially screened younger than 24 hours of age. [6] Infants receiving total parenteral nutrition are frequently falsely identified as having carnitine deficiency.\u00a0This false-positive is due to the lack of L-carnitine in the\u00a0total parenteral nutrition substrate, and the infant's levels will likely normalize with the introduction of normal feeding. [6] Most of the diseases on the newborn screening panel manifest after weeks or months after birth; however, some disorders become symptomatic before the results of the\u00a0newborn screening are known. [6] [1] Infants with symptoms suspicious for inborn errors of metabolism should be evaluated for acidemia, hypoglycemia, and hyperammonemia. [6] If an infant in the NICU has not had an echocardiogram, pulse oximetry screening should be performed prior to discharge. [6] Many aspects of prematurity and the NICU experience can predispose to hearing loss, including hypoxia, hyperbilirubinemia, antibiotics, ambient noise, and prolonged supplemental oxygen. [9] [6] All infants residing in the NICU for more than five days should have their hearing screened with\u00a0automated auditory brainstem response to\u00a0screen for neural hearing loss. [11] [9]",
