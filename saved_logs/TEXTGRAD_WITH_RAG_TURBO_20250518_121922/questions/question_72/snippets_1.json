        "content": "Infants in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) require additional considerations regarding newborn screening. Premature newborns have immature enzymes and metabolic instability, which result in more false-positive results. [6] To ensure appropriate sensitivity, infants in the NICU should be re-screened seven days after admission if they were initially screened younger than 24 hours of age. [6] Infants receiving total parenteral nutrition are frequently falsely identified as having carnitine deficiency.\u00a0This false-positive is due to the lack of L-carnitine in the\u00a0total parenteral nutrition substrate, and the infant's levels will likely normalize with the introduction of normal feeding. [6] Most of the diseases on the newborn screening panel manifest after weeks or months after birth; however, some disorders become symptomatic before the results of the\u00a0newborn screening are known. [6] [1] Infants with symptoms suspicious for inborn errors of metabolism should be evaluated for acidemia, hypoglycemia, and hyperammonemia. [6] If an infant in the NICU has not had an echocardiogram, pulse oximetry screening should be performed prior to discharge. [6] Many aspects of prematurity and the NICU experience can predispose to hearing loss, including hypoxia, hyperbilirubinemia, antibiotics, ambient noise, and prolonged supplemental oxygen. [9] [6] All infants residing in the NICU for more than five days should have their hearing screened with\u00a0automated auditory brainstem response to\u00a0screen for neural hearing loss. [11] [9]",

        "content": "Total medical care costs were studied prospectively from neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) discharge to 3 years of age for 60 children, 35 of whom had neurologic and/or developmental deficits detected immediately following NICU discharge and 25 children did not. At the end of the study period the children were classified as unhandicapped (group A), mildly handicapped (group B), or moderately-severely handicapped (group C). Medical costs are reported per infant per month following NICU discharge (mean +/- SD). The outpatient costs in group A were $31 +/- 23 as compared with $86 +/- 93 in group B and $109 +/- 59 in group C (A less than B, A less than C; P less than .001). The greatest contributor to outpatient costs was occupational and physical therapy (with unproven efficiency to date). The inpatient costs were $31 +/- 56 in group A, $328 +/- 574 in group B, and $542 +/- 737 in group C (A less than C; P less than .01). The US Department of Agriculture estimates of medical costs of raising a child at home ranges from $22 to $26.80 per month. The cost of raising one of our NICU infants in an institution was $1,216 per month. Children with and without neurodevelopmental deficits after NICU discharge have significantly higher medical costs than children without.",
