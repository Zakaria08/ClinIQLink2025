Document 1 (Title: EGF-like domain): Impaired coordination of calcium can result in serious disorders. Defective calcium binding to coagulation factor IX contributes to the development of hemophilia B. Individuals afflicted with this hereditary disease tend to develop hemorrhages, potentially leading to life-threatening conditions. The cause of hemophilia B is decreased activity or deficiency of blood coagulation factor IX. Point mutations resulting in decreased affinity of factor IX to calcium are thought to be implicated in this bleeding disorder. On a molecular basis, it appears that hemophilia B can be the result of an impaired ability to localize the Gla module efficiently, as it usually occurs after calcium coordination by the cbEGF module in fully functional factor IX. This defect is thought to impair the biological function of factor IX. A similar problem occurs in patients suffering from hemophilia B and carrying a mutation (Glu78Lys) in factor IX that prevents interaction of the two cbEGF modules with one
Document 2 (Title: Bleeding Disorders -- Epidemiology): Hereditary bleeding disorders are due to the absence or deficiency of specific clotting proteins which act as procoagulants through precise interactions in the clotting cascade.  The three most common are hemophilia A (Factor VIII deficiency), hemophilia B (Factor IX deficiency) and von Willebrand disease.   Hemophilia A is an X-linked recessive genetic disorder affecting 1 in 5000 males making it the most common congenital coagulopathy.  Hemophilia B is an X-linked genetic coagulopathy affecting 1 in 30000 male births.  Hemophilia B is also known as Christmas disease. The origin of its namesake is from Steven Christmas, the first patient diagnosed with Hemophilia B in 1952.  Since hemophilia is genetic, its prevalence increases in populations in which higher levels of consanguinity exists.  Females may be asymptomatic carriers of the hemophilia gene or may be found to have a partial deficiency of the specific factors involved. Von Willebrand disease is an autosomal dominant trait with no predilection for sex; however, women are more likely to exhibit symptoms as a result of increased bleeding during menstruation. [3] Von Willebrand disease was first described in 1926 by Finnish physician Erik Adolf von Willebrand. According to the CDC, von Willebrand disease affects approximately 1% of the general population.

Document 3 (Title: Molecular genetics of hemophilia A.): Hemophilia A is an X-linked bleeding disorder resulting from a defect in coagulation factor VIII. Clinical severity, the level of factor VIII activity and coagulant antigen vary widely. However, the three parameters breed true in families, indicating that the phenotypic expression directly reflects the genetic defect. In about 5%, hemophilia A results from partial deletion of the factor VIII gene and is clinically severe. In another 5% single base mutations have been found, which destroy the binding sites for the restriction enzyme TaqI. They can be "nonsense" mutations resulting in stop codons and clinically severe hemophilia, or "missense" mutations resulting in amino acid changes and milder forms of hemophilia. By the use of the polymerase chain reaction and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis we have detected several point mutations. The formation of anti-factor VIII antibodies appears to be more frequent in patients with defects resulting in absence of factor VIII protein. Carrier detection and prenatal diagnosis can be made with 100% certainty in families with identified mutations. In their absence, polymorphisms affecting recognition sequences for 2 restriction enzymes (BclI and XbaI) within or outside the factor VIII gene can serve as a tag for the mutation and be followed through the pedigree. In the absence of any informative polymorphism the conventional methods for carrier detection are still helpful.--In roughly 1/3 of the patients, the mutation appears "sporadic". However, it can usually be traced within one or two generations of the proband. --Some patients have mosaicism for sporadic mutations, indicating that mutagenesis not necessarily occurs at the level of the gametes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
