There have been instances of accidental overdoses occurring in patients. In\u00a0such a case, the patient was a 79-year-old man who self-administered pegfilgrastim for\u00a08 days in a row. He experienced no symptoms during this time but was monitored closely by his doctor\u00a03 times a week, during which he only complained of bone pain. In another overdose case, the patient was a 69-year-old man who self-administered a 36 mg overdose of pegfilgrastim. He was admitted to the hospital, where clinical staff observed leukocytosis, bone pain, and rhinorrhea. Due to the current lack of appropriate\u00a0treatment for pegfilgrastim overdose, the best course of action for overdose is prevention by vigilant monitoring for signs and symptoms of toxicity.

Where blood pressure is low or the heart rate is increasedlikely from bleeding in the abdomenimmediate surgery bypassing a CT scan is recommended. Modern 64-slice CT scans are able to rule out, with a high degree of accuracy, significant injuries to the neck following blunt trauma. Surgical techniques Surgical techniques, using a tube or catheter to drain fluid from the peritoneum, chest, or the pericardium around the heart, often are used in cases of severe blunt trauma to the chest or abdomen, especially when a person is experiencing early signs of shock. In those with low blood-pressure, likely because of bleeding in the abdominal cavity, cutting through the abdominal wall surgically is indicated. Prevention",

At the clinic visit, hydrochlorothi-azide 25 mg daily is added for better blood pressure control and also to treat symptoms and signs of fluid overload. Two weeks later, the patient presents to the emergency depart-ment with symptoms of weakness, anorexia, and generalized malaise. His blood pressure is now 91/58 mm Hg, and he has lost 15 kg in 2 weeks. His laboratory tests are signifi-cant for a serum creatinine of 10.8 mg/dL. What has led to the acute kidney injury? What is the reason for the weight loss? What precautions could have been taken to avoid this hospitalization?",
