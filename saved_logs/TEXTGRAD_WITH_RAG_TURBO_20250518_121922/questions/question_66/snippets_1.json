Lewis's strict implication is now a historical curiosity, but the formal modal logic in which he grounded that notion is the ancestor of all modern work on the subject. Lewis' notation is still standard, but current practice usually takes its dual, the square notation , meaning \"necessity\", which is stating a primitive notion, while the diamond notation, , is left as a defined (derived) meaning. With square notation \"A strictly implies B\" is simply written as (A\u2192B), which states explicitly that we are only implying the truth of B when A is true, and we are not implying anything about when B can be false, nor what A implies if it is false, in which case B can be false or B can just as well be true.",

        "content": "Occasionally, especially for liver transplantation in children, one cadaver organ can be split between two recipients (one adult and one child). A more viable alternative, transplantation of the right lobe of the liver from a healthy adult donor into an adult recipient, has gained increased popularity. Living donor transplantation of the left lobe (left lateral segment), introduced in the early 1990s to alleviate the extreme shortage of donor organs for small children, accounts currently for approximately one-third of all liver transplantation procedures in children. Driven by the shortage of cadaver organs, living donor transplantation involving the more sizable right lobe is being considered with increasing frequency in adults; however, living donor liver transplantation cannot be expected to solve the donor organ shortage; 246 such procedures were done in 2012, representing only about 4% of all liver transplant operations done in the United States.",

        "content": "Liver transplantation is an effective and widely accepted therapy for children with end-stage liver disease. Major indications include primary liver disease, resulting in hepatic insufficiency, or severe morbidity secondary to chronic non-progressive liver disease and metabolic diseases of the liver. Liver replacement should not be considered if there is an acceptable alternative therapy. Relative contraindications to transplantation include irreversible impairment of other organ systems, major systemic infection and diseases expected to recur after transplantation. Early referral for pre-transplant evaluation is important to confirm the proper diagnosis and determine priority for transplantation, to identify potential contraindications, and to assist in supportive care of the patient with chronic liver disease. Innovations such as reduced-sized liver grafts and most recently, living related liver transplantation have increased the donor supply of organs for small infants and significantly reduced pre-transplant mortality. In addition, living donor transplantation allows infants to benefit from transplantation before developing severe complications of end-stage liver disease and reduces the incidence of primary graft non-function and rejection. Immunosuppression following transplantation is maintained with methylprednisolone, azathioprine and cyclosporine. Acute rejection is treated with short bursts of high-dose corticosteroids and when necessary OKT3. With this approach, 90% of the episodes of rejection can be successfully controlled. Survival after transplantation has steadily improved and survival rates of 70%-90% are routine. Following transplantation, children experience rapid nutritional restoration, increased muscle strength, marked progress in gross motor development and improved general health.",
