Document 1 (Title: Immunology_Janeway): 14.4 True or False: Like other antibodies, IgE is mainly found in body fluids. 14.5 Matching: Match the following options with the best 14.6 Which of the following statements is true? A. Connective tissue mast cells do not participate in the initiation of an anaphylactic reaction. B. Epinephrine should be avoided in patients suffering from anaphylactic shock as it may worsen the patient’s condition. C. During anaphylactic shock, blood vessels lose permeability, and high blood pressure leads to death. D. Penicillin can modify self proteins, causing an immune response with IgE production in some individuals that can lead to anaphylaxis upon re-encountering the drug. 14.7 Multiple Choice: Hypersensitivity reactions can cause pathology through the deposition of immune complexes. Which of the following is a mechanism by which immune complexes can be pathogenic? (More than one may apply.) ___ A. Immune complexes deposit in blood vessel walls.
Document 2 (Title: Diagnostic Testing Accuracy: Sensitivity, Specificity, Predictive Values and Likelihood Ratios -- Issues of Concern -- Application Exercise): Let’s calculate the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, LR+, and LR-. We first can start with a 2X2 Table. The information above allows us to enter the values in the table below. Notice that values in blue cells were not provided, but we can get them based on the numbers above and the utilization of total cells. See Image. Diagnostic Testing Accuracy Table 2. The provider found that a total of 384 individuals actually had the disease, but how accurate was the blood test? Results: Sensitivity Sensitivity=(True Positives (A))/(True Positives (A)+False Negatives (C)) Sensitivity=(369 (A))/(369(A)+15 (C)) Sensitivity=369/384 Sensitivity=0.961 Specificity Specificity=(True Negatives (D))/(True Negatives (D)+False Positives (B)) Specificity=(558 (D))/(558(D)+58 (B)) Specificity=558/616 Specificity=0.906 Positive Predictive Value PPV =(True Positives (A))/(True Positives (A)+False Positives (B)) PPV =(369  (A))/(369 (A)+58(B)) PPV =369/427 PPV =0.864 Negative Predictive Value
Document 3 (Title: Programmed cell death): Basic morphological and biochemical features of PCD have been conserved in both plant and animal kingdoms. Specific types of plant cells carry out unique cell-death programs. These have common features with animal apoptosis—for instance, nuclear DNA degradation—but they also have their own peculiarities, such as nuclear degradation triggered by the collapse of the vacuole in tracheary elements of the xylem. Janneke Balk and Christopher J. Leaver, of the Department of Plant Sciences, University of Oxford, carried out research on mutations in the mitochondrial genome of sun-flower cells. Results of this research suggest that mitochondria play the same key role in vascular plant PCD as in other eukaryotic cells.

Describe in detail how mitochondria contribute to the transformation of lace plant leaves during programmed cell death.
