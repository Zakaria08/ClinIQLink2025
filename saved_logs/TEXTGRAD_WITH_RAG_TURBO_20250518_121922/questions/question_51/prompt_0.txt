With your own knowledge and the help of the following document:

Document 1 (Title: Jasmonate): Following its role in defense, JAs have also been implicated in cell death and leaf senescence. JA can interact with many kinases and transcription factors associated with senescence. JA can also induce mitochondrial death by inducing the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROSs). These compounds disrupt mitochondria membranes and compromise the cell by causing apoptosis, or programmed cell death. JAs' roles in these processes are suggestive of methods by which the plant defends itself against biotic challenges and limits the spread of infections.
Document 2 (Title: Cell_Biology_Alberts): thousands of caspase substrates have been identified. Which ones are the critical proteins that must be cleaved to trigger the major cell remodeling events underlying apoptosis? how did the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis evolve, and what is the advantage of having mitochondria play such a central role in regulating apoptosis? how are “don’t eat me” signals eliminated or inactivated during apoptosis to allow the cells to be phagocytosed? Which statements are true? Explain why or why not. 18–1 In normal adult tissues, cell death usually balances cell division. 18–2 Mammalian cells that do not have cytochrome c should be resistant to apoptosis induced by DNA damage. Discuss the following problems.
Document 3 (Title: Ubiquitin in health and disease.): Studies in recent years have shown that ubiquitin has increasingly important functions in eukaryotic cells; roles which were previously not suspected in healthy and diseased cells. The interplay between molecular pathological and molecular cell biological findings has indicated that ubiquitin may be pivotal in the cell stress response in chronic degenerative and viral diseases. Furthermore, the studies have led to the notion that ubiquitination may not only serve as a signal for nonlysosomal protein degradation but may be a unifying covalent protein modification for the major intracellular protein catabolic systems; these can act to identify proteins for cytosolic proteinases or direct intact and fragmented proteins into the lysosome system for breakdown to amino acids. This unifying role could explain why ubiquitin is restricted to eukaryotic cells, which possess extensive endomembrane systems in addition to a nuclear envelope. Protein ubiquitination is a feature of most filamentous inclusions and certain other intracellular conglomerates that are found in some degenerative and viral diseases. The detection of ubiquitin-protein conjugates is not of great diagnostic importance in these diseases. Protein ubiquitination is not only essential for the normal physiological turnover of proteins but appears to have been adapted as part of an intracellular surveillance system that can be activated by altered, damaged, or foreign proteins and organelles. The purpose of this system is to isolate and eliminate these noxious structures from the cell: as a cytoprotective mechanism this appears to have evolved in the cell akin perhaps to an 'intracellular immune system'. Other heat shock proteins such as hsp 70 may be involved in this process. It is apparent that ubiquitin has a role in embryonic development. Protein ubiquitination is presumably involved in the reorganisation of cytoplasm that accompanies cell differentiation. Ubiquitin is also necessary for the gross intracellular degradative processes which are consequent upon programmed cell death. Cell elimination is of key importance for a number of developmental morphogenetic changes. An understanding of the molecular details of these processes will no doubt provide further insights into the wide ranging roles of ubiquitin in the life process. As it says in the book 'Ubiquitin'; there is no doubt that ubiquitin is a 'lucky' protein. It is lucky in many ways: lucky for scientific progress, lucky for biomedical scientists and lucky for life! If you have not already done so, why don't you get lucky and look for a role for ubiquitin in your experimental system. As Avram Hershko has said "there is plenty to go round"!
