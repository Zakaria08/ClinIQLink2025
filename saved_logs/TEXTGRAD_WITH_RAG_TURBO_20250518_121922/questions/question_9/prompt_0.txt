Document 1 (Title: Difficulties in taking care of business: women addicts as mothers.): This paper is devoted to a discussion of women addicts as mothers. Women who are addicted while pregnant begin their careers as mothers with extreme guilt and a sense of initial failure. Heroin becomes a mechanism for coping with the routine difficulties of childraising. Children can also act as a controlling force on their mother's addiction if she has the option to perform her mothering duties in an otherwise "normal" fashion. If the woman is being supported adequately and can be available for her children, it is possible to combine addiction and mothering. Often, however, the woman has to work outside the home (usually in criminal pursuits) and the general chaos of her life greatly impinges on her ability to fulfill her mothering duties. Children are occasionally mistreated, sometimes neglected physically, and often neglected psychologically by a mother who is frequently absent. Addicted mothers feel extreme guilt and remorse over this neglect, and often take stock of their situation when their roles as a mother is threatened; the children are being taken away physically or growing up and she is losing them to time. The woman addict most often wants "out" of the heroin life when her children and her role as mother--her last remaining option--are in jeopardy.
Document 2 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): A 21-year-old woman comes with her parents to discuss therapeutic options for her Crohn’s disease. She was diag-nosed with Crohn’s disease 2 years ago, and it involves her terminal ileum and proximal colon, as confirmed by colonoscopy and small bowel radiography. She was initially treated with mesalamine and budesonide with good response, but over the last 2 months, she has had a relapse of her symptoms. She is experiencing fatigue, cramping, abdominal pains, and nonbloody diarrhea up to 10 times daily, and she has had a 15-lb weight loss. She has no other significant medical or surgical his-tory. Her current medications are mesalamine 2.4 g/d and budesonide 9 mg/d. She appears thin and tired. Abdominal examination reveals tenderness without guarding in the right lower quadrant; no masses are palpable. On perianal examination, there is no tenderness, fissure, or fistula. Her laboratory data are notable for anemia and elevated C-reactive protein. What are the options for immediate
Document 3 (Title: Outline of cardiology): Ion channels Ion channels are responsible for cell membrane voltage, depolarization, and repolarization. These actions lead to conduction of signals down nerves and contraction of cardiomyocytes. Perhaps the most prominent manipulation of ion channels is through antiarrhythmic agents. These agents are commonly classified by the type of ion they manipulate and named the Vaughan Williams classification: Class I — Sodium channel blockers Class Ia — Fast sodium channels (quinidine, ajmaline, procainamide, disopyramide) Class Ib — Sodium channels (lidocaine, phenytoin, mexiletine, tocainide) Class Ic — Decrease conductivity (encainide, flecainide, propafenone, moricizine) Class II — Beta blockers (carvedilol, propranolol, esmolol, timolol, metoprolol, atenolol, bisoprolol) Class III — Potassium channel blockers (amiodarone, sotalol, ibutilide, dofetilide, dronedarone) Class IV — Calcium channel blockers (verapamil, diltiazem) Class V — Other (adenosine, digoxin, magnesium Sulfate)
