Document 3 (Title: Pennsylvania Child Abuse Recognition and Reporting -- Pearls and Other Issues -- A 13-year-old girl is brought to her pediatrician because of a recent decline in her grades. During a private interview, she admits she has "problems with boys at school" and "bad dreams about boys always staring at her." The child privately admits she regularly gets up in the middle of the night and sleeps with the biological mother on her side of the bed, with her stepfather next to her mother. The child indicates the stepfather has commented that she is a "looker," has "big headlights," and needs to "fend off the boys at school." The pediatrician attended high school with the stepfather and knows he is not the "brightest bulb" but seems to care about the child genuinely. The child indicates the stepfather wears pajamas, has never touched her, and always knocks before entering the bathroom or her room. She says she is very anxious about attending school and is afraid to speak with her mother about her school problems. She says her stepfather has always been "very good" to her mother and is always kind and considerate to her as well. She does not want to get him into trouble but feels his comments about her appearance add to her anxiety. What should the pediatrician do in this situation?): Given the totality of the circumstances, there may not be reasonable cause to suspect child abuse; however, there remain numerous concerns, such as the child's problems at school, nightmares, child co-sleeping at the age of 13, and the stepfather's inappropriate comments to the child. General concerns for a child's safety, health, and well-being may be reported to ChildLine for assessment of services and support. The PA CPSL prescribes that a person, hospital, institution, school, facility, agency, or agency employee acting in good faith shall have immunity from civil and criminal liability that might otherwise result from making a report of suspected child abuse or making a referral for general protective services, regardless of whether the report is required to be made under the PA CPSL.
