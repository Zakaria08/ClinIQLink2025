Document 1 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): A 21-year-old woman comes with her parents to discuss therapeutic options for her Crohn’s disease. She was diag-nosed with Crohn’s disease 2 years ago, and it involves her terminal ileum and proximal colon, as confirmed by colonoscopy and small bowel radiography. She was initially treated with mesalamine and budesonide with good response, but over the last 2 months, she has had a relapse of her symptoms. She is experiencing fatigue, cramping, abdominal pains, and nonbloody diarrhea up to 10 times daily, and she has had a 15-lb weight loss. She has no other significant medical or surgical his-tory. Her current medications are mesalamine 2.4 g/d and budesonide 9 mg/d. She appears thin and tired. Abdominal examination reveals tenderness without guarding in the right lower quadrant; no masses are palpable. On perianal examination, there is no tenderness, fissure, or fistula. Her laboratory data are notable for anemia and elevated C-reactive protein. What are the options for immediate
Document 2 (Title: Jeanne Calment): Medical follow-up Medical student Georges Garoyan published a thesis on Calment when she was 114 years old in January 1990. The first part records her daily routine, and the second presents her medical history. She stated that she had been vaccinated as a child but could not remember which vaccine(s). Apart from aspirin against migraines she had never taken any medicine, not even herbal teas. She did not contract German measles, chickenpox, or urinary infections, and was not prone to hypertension or diabetes. In April 1986, aged 111, she was sent to a hospital for heart failure and treated with digoxin. Later she suffered from arthropathy in the ankles, elbows, and wrists, which was successfully treated with anti-inflammatory medication. Her arterial blood pressure was 140mm/70mm, her pulse 84/min. Her height was , and her weight , showing little variation from previous years. She scored well on mental tests, except on numeric tasks and recall of recent events.
Document 3 (Title: A case of opiate-insensitive pain: malignant treatment of benign pain.): We report the case of a woman with presumed cancer pain treated with escalating doses of opiates despite no evident improvement in her pain and several deleterious side effects. A 62-year-old woman with cervical myelopathy and a diagnosis of a spinal cord tumor was referred to the University of Washington Medical Center complaining of chest tightness, multiple joint pains, nausea, constipation, seizures and a deteriorating memory. At the time of admission she was confined to her bed with a full-time attendant and was receiving 240 milligrams of intravenous morphine per hour for her pain. Diagnostic studies failed to find any evidence of neoplasm and revealed only an old hemorrhage within the cervical spinal cord. A program of increasing physical and occupational therapy and decreasing opiate intake was initiated. Within a month the patient's pain complaints decreased, as did the rest of her presenting complaints. Her activities of daily living greatly increased making attendant care no longer necessary. This case report illustrates some of the hazards of opioid therapy in the management of patients with chronic pain. Our patient's opiate therapy was expensive, gave her undesirable side effects, and did not reduce her pain complaints or improve her function. In the treatment of chronic pain, of noncancerous or cancerous origin, a) systemic opioids may not be effective in reducing pain complaints in every patient, b) treatment efficacy evaluation should always include functional endpoints, and c) nonefficacious treatments should not be continued indefinitely.
