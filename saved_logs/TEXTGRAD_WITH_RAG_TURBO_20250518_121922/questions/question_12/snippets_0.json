        "content": "Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) is an autoimmune disorder that affects the presynaptic portion of the neuromuscular junction. This rare disease can be marked by a unique triad of symptoms: proximal muscle weakness, autonomic dysfunction, and areflexia. Proximal muscle weakness is a product of pathogenic autoantibodies directed against P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channels, which in turn leads to a reduction of acetylcholine release from motor nerve terminals on the presynaptic cell. Examples of autonomic dysfunction caused by LEMS include erectile dysfunction in men, constipation, and, most commonly, dry mouth. Less common dysfunctions include dry eyes and altered perspiration. Areflexia is a condition in which tendon reflexes are reduced and it may subside temporarily after a period of exercise.",

        "content": "In this review the effects of aminopyridines and chemically related compounds are documented in an attempt to analyse the mechanism underlying their presynaptic actions at the vertebrate neuromuscular junction. Aminopyridines and related compounds are of particular interest because they greatly increase the amount of acetylcholine released in response to both conducted nerve impulses and electrotonic depolarizations of tetrodotoxin blocked motor nerve terminals. The apparent rank order of potency for increasing quantal transmitter release evoked by nerve impulse at physiological pH was as follows: 3,4-diaminopyridine greater than 4-aminopyridine greater than 4-aminoquinoline greater than 3-aminopyridine greater than 2,6-diaminopyridine greater than 2-aminopyridine greater than 4-nitropyridine greater than 4-aminopyridine N-oxyde greater than 4-hydroxypyridine greater than 2,4-dihydroxypyridine. The fact that both pyridine and aniline were found to be inactive indicate that both a pyridine ring and an amino-substituent are necessary for activity. A common site of action for the drugs here reported should be rationalized on the basis that their protonated molecular forms generate a common electrostatic potential field pattern. This results together with those concerning the dependence of pyridine activity on extracellular pH leads to the conclusion that this family of compounds exert its activity at the internal face of the motor nerve terminal membrane. Aminopyridines in concentrations that increase transmitter release evoked by nerve impulses block potassium conductance in motor nerve terminals and lengthen the presynaptic action potential, this effect leads to an enhanced calcium influx and consequently to an increase in acetylcholine release. The fact that aminopyridines had no consistent effect on transmitter release at junctions depolarized by elevated potassium ions strongly supports the view that these drugs have no direct effect on voltage-dependent calcium channels and that their primary site of action is on voltage-sensitive potassium channels of motor nerve terminals.",
