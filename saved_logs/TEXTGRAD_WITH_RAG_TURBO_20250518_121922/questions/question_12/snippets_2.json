        "content": "Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) is an autoimmune disorder that affects the presynaptic portion of the neuromuscular junction. This rare disease can be marked by a unique triad of symptoms: proximal muscle weakness, autonomic dysfunction, and areflexia. Proximal muscle weakness is a product of pathogenic autoantibodies directed against P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channels, which in turn leads to a reduction of acetylcholine release from motor nerve terminals on the presynaptic cell. Examples of autonomic dysfunction caused by LEMS include erectile dysfunction in men, constipation, and, most commonly, dry mouth. Less common dysfunctions include dry eyes and altered perspiration. Areflexia is a condition in which tendon reflexes are reduced and it may subside temporarily after a period of exercise.",

        "content": "Elmquist and Lambert, from a series of studies of excised muscle, deduced that there is a defect in the release of ACh quanta from the presynaptic nerve terminals, akin to the effects of botulinum toxin, magnesium excess, and neomycin. The presynaptic vesicles themselves appear to be normal in morphology and content. Also in contrast to myasthenia gravis, the surface area of the postsynaptic receptor membrane in this syndrome is actually increased (A.G. Engel, 1976). The physiologic mechanism in Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome is a loss of voltage-gated calcium channels on the presynaptic motor nerve terminal. The calcium channels become cross-linked and aggregated by IgG autoantibodies, ultimately reducing the number of functioning channels (Fukunaga et al). These antibodies against a specific component of the presynaptic membrane have the effect of reducing the presynaptic release of ACh, virtually the opposite of myasthenia gravis.",
