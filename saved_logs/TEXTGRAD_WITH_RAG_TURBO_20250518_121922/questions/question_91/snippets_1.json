However, an alternative hypothesis to the cause of SLIs has been posited, called the Procedural Deficit Hypothesis. The Procedural Deficit Hypothesis opines that we can explain language impairments due to abnormal development of brain structures that are involved in procedural memory, our memories that remember how to perform different cognitive and motor tasks. The procedural memory system is associated with basal-ganglia circuits in the frontal lobe and further investigation of this particular hypothesis could aid in the development of a clinical neurological picture of what the underlying causes of SLI are.

Biases in study design, data collection, data analysis, or presentation of findings can lead to research findings when they do not truly exist. As bias increases, the positive predictive value (PPV) of a given finding being true decreases considerably. The overall effect of bias again depends on both the power and prestudy odds of a given study.

Medical research operates in areas with low preand poststudy probability for true findings, meaning it may be quite common that observed effect sizes varying around the null hypothesis (what one would expect from chance alone) are simply measuring the prevailing bias of a given field.In addition to bias, the globalization of research means that at any given time it is almost a certainty that multiple research teams are investigating the same",

        "content": "Various psychological factors contribute to the development of personality disorders. Freud posited that certain personality traits result from\u00a0fixations at specific psychosexual developmental stages. For instance, individuals with OCPD\u00a0are theorized to exhibit characteristics\u00a0such as stubbornness, parsimony, and high conscientiousness, which Freud attributed to fixations at the anal stage due to struggles during toilet training. [16] Other psychological frameworks suggest that maladaptive defense mechanisms, such as isolation of affect, reaction formation, intellectualization, and undoing, play a role in developing and perpetuating obsessive-compulsive traits. [17] Parenting styles, specifically those of overly controlling parents, have been posited as a contributing factor in the development of OCPD, although empirical support for this hypothesis is limited. [18] Attachment theory offers another perspective, proposing that individuals with OCPD may have experienced difficulties in forming secure attachments during their formative years. [1] Alternative hypotheses suggest that traits associated with OCPD may stem from cognitive deficits or imbalances related to empathy and rule comprehension. [19] However, it is essential\u00a0to note that these theories face critical scrutiny and require further empirical investigation for validation.",
