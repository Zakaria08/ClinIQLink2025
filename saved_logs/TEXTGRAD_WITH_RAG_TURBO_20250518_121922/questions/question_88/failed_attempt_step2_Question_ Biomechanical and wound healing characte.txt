== Original Prompt ==
Question: Biomechanical and wound healing characteristics of corneas after excimer laser keratorefractive surgery: is there a difference between advanced surface ablation and sub-Bowman's keratomileusis?
Options:
A. True
B. False

Please respond strictly with one of the following JSON formats:
{"answer": "True"}
or
{"answer": "False"}

Please respond **only** with a single valid JSON object in the following format:
{"answer": "True"}  ← if the answer is true
{"answer": "False"} ← if the answer is false
Do not include any other text or comments. Output must be strictly JSON.

== Full Prompt ==
Could you analyze and compare the biomechanical and wound healing characteristics of corneas after excimer laser treatment, specifically focusing on the differences between advanced surface ablation and sub-Bowman's keratomileusis?

Options:
A. True
B. False

Please respond strictly with one of the following JSON formats:
{"answer": "True"}
or
{"answer": "False"}

Please respond **only** with a single valid JSON object in the following format:

{"answer": "False"} ← if the answer is false
Do not include any other text or comments. Output must be strictly JSON.
== Answer ==
{"answer": "True"}

== Feedback ==
Incorrect answer: The prompt requires a comparison of biomechanical and wound healing characteristics, which cannot be answered with a simple true/false; the prompt should ask a question that can be answered with true or false.

== Improved Full Prompt ==
Could you provide a detailed analysis and comparison of the biomechanical properties and wound healing processes, focusing on the differences between advanced surface ablation and sub-Bowman's keratomileusis?
