Document 1 (Title: Refractive surgery): Transepithelial photorefractive keratectomy (TransPRK) is a laser-assisted eye surgery to correct refraction errors of human eye cornea. It employs excimer laser to ablate outer layer of cornea, epithelium, as well its connective tissue, stroma, to correct eye optical power. Laser Assisted Sub-Epithelium Keratomileusis (LASEK) is a procedure that also changes the shape of the cornea using an excimer laser to ablate the tissue from the corneal stroma, under the corneal epithelium, which is kept mostly intact to act as a natural bandage. The surgeon uses an alcohol solution to loosen then lift a thin layer of the epithelium with a trephine blade (usually with a thickness of 50 micrometres). During the weeks following LASEK, the epithelium heals, leaving no permanent flap in the cornea. This healing process can involve discomfort comparable to that with PRK.
Document 2 (Title: Middermal wound healing. A comparison between dermatomal excision and pulsed carbon dioxide laser ablation.): Continuous-wave carbon dioxide lasers are not widely used for the surgical removal of most skin lesions because it is difficult to control laser ablation and the extensive laser-induced thermal damage slows healing. Pulsed lasers provide means to reduce thermal damage produced during laser ablation and permit precise control of tissue removed during ablation. Using a swine model, we compared on a gross and microscopic level the healing of middermal wounds of similar depth and area created by a dermatome and a focused pulsed CO2 laser. Pulsed CO2 laser ablation removed skin precisely and bloodlessly with 85 +/- 15 microns (mean +/- SD) of residual thermal damage covering the surface of the wound. Compared with the dermatome, tissue reepithelialization was delayed in the laser wounds at day 3. By day 7, epithelial coverage of the laser-created wounds was not significantly different from the dermatome-created wounds. No significant difference in the appearance of the two wounds was noted at 42 days. We conclude that the focused pulsed CO2 laser is capable of precisely and bloodlessly ablating skin with conservation of residual subjacent adnexal elements, minimal early interference with epibolic epithelial outgrowth, and no pathologic effects on the wound healing process. Pulsed CO2 lasers may be a valuable instrument for the conservative ablation of skin and skin lesions.
Document 3 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): to younger volunteers.59 In the same volunteers, using a micro-model of fibroplasia, no dif-ference in DNA or hydroxyproline wound accumulation could be demonstrated between the young and elderly groups; how-ever, the young volunteers had a significantly higher amount of total α-amino nitrogen in their wounds, a reflection of total protein content of the wound. Thus, although wound collagen synthesis does not seem to be impaired with advanced age, non-collagenous protein accumulation at wounded sites is decreased with aging, which may impair the mechanical properties of scar-ring in elderly patients. Generally, in a relatively healthy person age will cause a delay in healing rather than nonhealing.Hypoxia, Anemia, and Hypoperfusion. Low oxygen tension has a profoundly deleterious effect on all aspects of wound heal-ing. Fibroplasia, although stimulated initially by the hypoxic wound environment, is significantly impaired by local hypoxia. Optimal collagen synthesis requires oxygen as

Could you provide a detailed analysis and comparison of the biomechanical properties and wound healing processes, focusing on the differences between advanced surface ablation and sub-Bowman's keratomileusis?
