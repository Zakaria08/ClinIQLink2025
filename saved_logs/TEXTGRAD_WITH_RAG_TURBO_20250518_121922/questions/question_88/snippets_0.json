        "title": "[Wound healing of the cornea of New World monkeys after surface keratectomy: Er:YAG-excimer laser].",
        "content": "Corneal wound healing was studied after photoablation with an excimer laser (193 nm, 43 pulses at 180 mJ/cm2 [symbol: see text] 11 microns ablation depth, optical zone 2.0 mm) and with an erbium-YAG laser (2.94 microns, 5 pulses at 2.5 J/cm2 [symbol: see text] 50 microns ablation depth, optical zone 1.6 mm). The corneas of marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) were prepared 5 and 10 days and 4 and 25 weeks after photoablation. The sections were investigated by conventional light microscopy or exposed to antibodies against collagen types I, III, IV, VII and laminin and stained by indirect immunofluorescence. Macroscopically, the time-course of wound healing was comparable to that seen, after laser keratomileusis for correction of myopia in humans (epithelium closure after 24-48 h, subepithelial haze: erbium-YAG less than or equal to excimer). Histologically the time-course of wound healing could be schematically divided into three phases: (1) epithelial hyperplasia, inhomogeneous new synthesis of collagen fibrils subepithelially; (2) reorganization of the epithelium, hyperplasia of keratocytes, incipient reorganization of the collagen fibrils, increase in subepithelial haze; (3) reorganization of the collagen fibrils, decrease in subepithelial haze. The distribution of collagen type VII during the corneal wound healing suggests that the subepithelial haze observed during the healing process after laser keratomileusis for correction of myopia is based on the anchoring fibrils of the basement membrane.",

        "content": "Laser refractive surgeries act upon the surface of the cornea, the transparent, dome-shaped, outermost layer that covers the front of the eye. The first step of PRK requires complete removal of the superficial corneal epithelium down to Bowman\u2019s layer. The excimer laser then ablates the stroma, thereby remodeling the corneal surface. Further information regarding the excimer laser follows below. Following the procedure, re-epithelialization occurs via the migration of fibroblasts and collagen synthesis. [2]",

        "content": "Transepithelial photorefractive keratectomy (TransPRK) is a laser-assisted eye surgery to correct refraction errors of human eye cornea. It employs excimer laser to ablate outer layer of cornea, epithelium, as well its connective tissue, stroma, to correct eye optical power. Laser Assisted Sub-Epithelium Keratomileusis (LASEK) is a procedure that also changes the shape of the cornea using an excimer laser to ablate the tissue from the corneal stroma, under the corneal epithelium, which is kept mostly intact to act as a natural bandage. The surgeon uses an alcohol solution to loosen then lift a thin layer of the epithelium with a trephine blade (usually with a thickness of 50 micrometres). During the weeks following LASEK, the epithelium heals, leaving no permanent flap in the cornea. This healing process can involve discomfort comparable to that with PRK.",
