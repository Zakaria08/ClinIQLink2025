Document 2 (Title: Infant Nutrition Requirements and Options -- Function -- Vitamins:): Preterm infants are prone to vitamin deficiencies due to lower stores, increase requirements, and immature metabolic processes. The opposite is also true that these preterm infants are at higher risk for toxicity due to immature and compromised renal function. Fat-soluble vitamins include vitamins A, D, E, and K. Vitamin A (Retinol) is known to play an essential role in the growth and development of skin, eyes, bones, and pulmonary epithelium. It is thus implicated in chronic lung disease, photophobia, abnormal epiphyseal bone growth, and FTT. Vitamin E (tocopherol) has an antioxidant role in iron-induced hemolysis. Vitamin K plays a vital role in coagulation through carboxylation of prothrombin into its active form, thus essential in preventing hemorrhagic disease of the newborn. Vitamin D plays a crucial role in calcium and phosphorus metabolism in conjunction with parathyroid hormone. Vitamin D deficiency is associated with rickets, osteopenia of prematurity, and failure to thrive. Water-soluble vitamins B and C, on the other hand, require daily intake to meet their requirements.
Document 3 (Title: Aquagenic urticaria): Once known as a separate, rare disease, aquagenic urticaria is now considered a subtype of general urticaria. The first case was reported by Walter B Shelley et al. in 1964. The condition is more common in women than men, and typically presents for the first time during puberty. Genetics may play a part, and the condition may be related to other sensitivities such as lactose intolerance. Prevention Desensitization does not seem to work for aquagenic urticaria; a patient will continue to react to water no matter how gradually or frequently it is introduced. Topical application of antihistamines like 1% diphenhydramine before water exposure is reported to reduce the hives. Oil in water emulsion creams, or petrolatum, applied as barrier agents prior to a shower or bath may control symptoms. Therapeutic effectiveness of various classes of drugs differs from case to case.

Could syncope during bathing in infants be a pediatric form of water-induced urticaria?
