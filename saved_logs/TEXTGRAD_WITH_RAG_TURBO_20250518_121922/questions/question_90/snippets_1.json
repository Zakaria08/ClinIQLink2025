High level of CCL20 in liver chemoattract colorectal carcinoma cells and cause metastases in liver. Novel research has identified a microRNA that is able to downregulate CCR6 in cancer cell lines.

There is a 5% five-year survival rate with no treatment. The five-year survival after curative resection of hepatic lesions may be up to 58%, in contrast to a median of 6 months of survival with no treatment.
