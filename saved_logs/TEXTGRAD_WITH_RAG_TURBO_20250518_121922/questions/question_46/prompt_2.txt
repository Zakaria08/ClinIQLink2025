Document 1 (Title: Anaphylactoid reaction following ketorolac tromethamine administration.): To report a case of an anaphylactoid reaction to injectable ketorolac tromethamine in a patient with no prior history of allergies or risk factors associated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced hypersensitivity reactions. A 37-year-old man without a significant medical history presented to an emergency department with vague, dull, left-sided chest pain. Myocardial infarction was ruled out based on an unremarkable electrocardiogram, chest X-ray, and laboratory data that were within normal limits. Sublingual nitroglycerin 0.4 mg, magnesium/aluminum hydroxide gel 30 mL, and intravenous ranitidine 50 mg were administered without resolution of symptoms. Ketorolac tromethamine 60 mg was administered intramuscularly with resolution of symptoms. The patient was discharged; however, within 30 minutes, he returned to the emergency department with facial swelling, shortness of breath, and chest tightness. Multiple doses of aerosolized albuterol and intravenous methylprednisolone and diphenhydramine were administered, resulting in a slight improvement of symptoms. The patient was admitted for a complete cardiac evaluation that proved negative. The allergic symptoms resolved and the patient was discharged without medication after a three-day hospitalization. Ketorolac tromethamine is the first injectable nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug approved for short-term pain management. A review of the literature revealed no similar cases of anaphylactoid reaction. Healthcare professionals must be aware of the potential risks of anaphylactoid reactions, especially in light of the increased use of injectable ketorolac in the ambulatory setting and availability of the oral formulation.
Document 2 (Title: Anatomy_Gray): A 53-year-old man presented to the emergency department with a 5-hour history of sharp pleuritic chest pain and shortness of breath. The day before he was on a long haul flight, returning from his holidays. He was usually fit and well and was a keen mountain climber. He had no previous significant medical history. On physical examination his lungs were clear, he was tachypneic at 24/min, and his saturation was reduced to 92% on room air. Pulmonary embolism was suspected and the patient was referred for a CT pulmonary angiogram. The study demonstrated clots within the right and left main pulmonary arteries. There was no pleural effusion, lung collapse, or consolidation. He was immediately started on subcutaneous enoxaparin and converted to oral anticoagulation over the course of a couple of days. The whole treatment lasted 6 months as no other risk factors (except immobilization during a long haul flight) were identified. There were no permanent sequelae.
Document 3 (Title: Case Study: 32-Year-Old Male Presenting with Right Lower Quadrant Abdominal Pain (Archived) -- Case Presentation): He describes the pain as coming on suddenly and sharp in nature.   Since the onset, his pain started to improve until the morning of his presentation to the emergency department, when it acutely worsened. He says that the pain is much worse with movement.

A 27-year-old man arrives at the emergency department with acute chest pain, shortness of breath, and excessive sweating. He mentions these symptoms started suddenly while exercising. He has a history of smoking and reports a high-stress lifestyle. Provide a detailed explanation of how these risk factors correlate with his symptoms.
