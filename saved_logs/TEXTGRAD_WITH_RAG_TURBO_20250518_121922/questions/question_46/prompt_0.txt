Document 1 (Title: Biochemistry_Lippinco): .5. A 67-year-old man presented to the emergency department with a 1-week history of angina and shortness of breath. He complained that his face and extremities had taken on a blue color. His medical history included chronic stable angina treated with isosorbide dinitrate and nitroglycerin. Blood obtained for analysis was brown. Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis? A. Carboxyhemoglobinemia B. Hemoglobin SC disease C. Methemoglobinemia D. Sickle cell anemia E. β-Thalassemia
Document 2 (Title: Anaphylactic shock secondary to rattlesnake bite.): Anaphylactic reactions to Crotalidae envenomation are extremely rare. The presentation of anaphylaxis after envenomation can be a confusing variable in the timely diagnosis of both problems. The therapy of this dual disorder involves combining treatment of the obvious shock from the allergic reaction with a standard approach to Crotalidae envenomation. We present the case of a 22-year-old man who presented to the emergency department with urticaria, hypotension, and bronchospasm that developed immediately after his second envenomation from a rattlesnake. His symptoms resolved after administration of 0.8 mg SQ epinephrine, 100 mg IV diphenhydramine, 2,000 mL normal saline IV, and 250 mg IV methylprednisolone. Only one previous case report of anaphylactic shock from a rattlesnake bite could be found in the medical literature.
Document 3 (Title: Latrodectism): Diagnosis There are no tests required to diagnose widow spider bites, or latrodectism symptoms. The diagnosis is clinical and based on historic evidence of widow spider bites. Pathognomonic symptoms such as localized sweating and piloerection provide evidence of envenomation. Diagnosis in most people includes reporting contact with a Latrodectus spider. Overdiagnosis is a risk, without a spider to identify. However, without a history of contact, the diagnosis may be missed as symptoms overlap with a variety of other serious clinical syndromes such as tetanus or acute abdomen. Blood values are typically unimportant but may be needed to show myocarditis or dehydration from vomiting. Treatment People who have been bitten by a black widow spider are recommended to seek professional medical assistance for symptoms. Symptoms self-resolve in hours to days in a majority of bites without medical intervention.

A 27-year-old man arrives at the emergency room with symptoms that suggest a specific diagnosis. Based on his clinical presentation and medical history, what known risk factor could contribute to his most likely diagnosis?

Options:
A. Contaminated beef
B. Epiglottic cyst
C. Mosquito bite
D. Spelunking
