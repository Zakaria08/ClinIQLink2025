Document 1 (Title: NIH conference. Hepatocellular carcinoma.): Hepatocellular carcinoma is the most frequent cancer worldwide, responsible for approximately 1,000,000 deaths annually, most of them in the Far East and in sub-Saharan Africa. It usually presents at an advanced stage and has a poor prognosis. There is evidence of an etiologic role for hepatitis B virus infection in the etiology of hepatocellular carcinoma. Carriers of the virus are 94 times more at risk for hepatocellular carcinoma than noncarriers. In many cases hepatitis B virus DNA is integrated within the cellular genome of the tumor. Programs have been established to detect hepatocellular carcinoma at an early stage; persons at high risk are regularly screened by measurement of serum alpha-fetoprotein levels and ultrasound examination of the liver. Surgical resection offers the only hope of cure at present, as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and immunotherapy have not shown promise. Ideally, surgery should be done on small asymptomatic tumors.
Document 2 (Title: Gynecology_Novak): Clinical Stage II Endometrial cancer involving the cervix either contiguously or by lymphatic spread has a poorer prognosis than disease confined to the corpus (267,278,318–334). Preoperative assessment of cervical involvement is difficult. Endocervical curettage has relatively high false-positive (50% to 80%) and false-negative rates. Histologic proof of cancer infiltration of the cervix or presence of obvious tumor on the cervix is the only reliable means of diagnosing cervical involvement, although ultrasonography, hysteroscopy, or MRI may show cervical invasion. The relatively small number of true stage II cases in reported series and the lack of randomized, prospective studies preclude formulation of a definitive treatment plan. Three areas must be addressed in any treatment plan: 1. For optimal results, the uterus should be removed in all patients. 2.
Document 3 (Title: Hepatocellular Carcinoma  -- Prognosis): Five-year survival of hepatocellular carcinoma is 18% and second to pancreatic cancer. The prognosis of patients with HCC is dependent on the tumor size, differentiation or grade of the tumor on histopathology, severity of the underlying liver disease, presence or absence of metastases, and tumor extension to adjacent structures. HCC with high levels of alpha-fetoprotein is associated with poorly differentiated HCC and confers a poor prognosis. [65] Patients with hepatitis B virus-related HCC and positive serum hepatitis B e antigen(HBeAg) are associated with poor prognosis and higher recurrence of HCC. [66] [67] High levels of serum hepatitis B virus DNA are associated with a higher risk for HCC and recurrence. [68] [69] Diabetes mellitus is a risk factor for the development of HCC and also associated with a poor prognosis. [70]

What is the prognosis for well-differentiated small hepatocellular carcinoma, and is it considered clinically early-stage cancer?
