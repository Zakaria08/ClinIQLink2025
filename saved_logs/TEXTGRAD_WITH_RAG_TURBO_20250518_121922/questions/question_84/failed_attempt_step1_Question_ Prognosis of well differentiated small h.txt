{
    "answer": "True"
}

== Feedback ==
Incorrect answer: The answer should be "False" as well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma is not necessarily clinically early cancer; the prompt should clarify the clinical criteria for "early cancer" to avoid ambiguity.

== Improved Full Prompt ==
What is the prognosis for well-differentiated small hepatocellular carcinoma, and is it considered clinically early-stage cancer?
