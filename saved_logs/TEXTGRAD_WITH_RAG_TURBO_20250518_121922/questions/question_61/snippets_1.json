        "title": "How should results from completed studies influence ongoing clinical trials? The CAFA Study experience.",
        "content": "Seven randomized studies during the past 5 years have evaluated or are evaluating the efficacy of warfarin or aspirin or both in decreasing the risk of embolic events in patients with nonrheumatic atrial fibrillation. By March 1990, two of the studies had been published, both of which showed a statistically significant decrease in embolic events in patients treated with warfarin and a low rate of major bleeding events. The investigators associated with the other ongoing studies were forced to consider how these results should affect the decision to recruit and continue follow-up of patients in their own studies. The Steering Committee of the Canadian Atrial Fibrillation Anticoagulation (CAFA) study thought the newly published results from other studies were valid, clinically important, and generalizable. The committee considered the following options for the CAFA study: continue patient recruitment as planned, provide the data available in CAFA to its External Safety and Efficacy Monitoring Committee for analysis to determine whether the CAFA data already showed a benefit of warfarin, stop patient recruitment but continue to follow patients in the group to which they were assigned, stop the trial immediately and perform a final analysis, and attempt to perform a meta-analysis of all data available from all trials. The Steering Committee of CAFA decided that the evidence of benefit with warfarin, from the two published studies, was sufficiently compelling as to stop recruitment into CAFA without any preliminary examination of the CAFA data.",

        "content": "Left ventricular true aneurysms merit consideration as this can mimic false aneurysms (see Image. Left Ventricular Aneurysm, Ultrasound). This is a relatively frequent complication compared to false aneurysms and occurs in 10% to 35% of patients following myocardial infarction. [17] Differentiating can often be difficult pre-operatively. Unlike a false aneurysm, a true aneurysm contains all\u00a03 layers of the myocardial wall. A true aneurysm is an abnormal left ventricular diastolic contour with systolic dyskinesia or paradoxical bulging, leading to decreased ejection fraction. True aneurysms tend to be on the anterior or apical segments, whereas false aneurysms are more common posteriorly. [9] True aneurysms are generally non-contractile and have a thinned myocardium. Upon evaluation, the neck of the true aneurysm was not seen to be narrower than the size of the cavity. These patients have a much lower risk of rupture than false aneurysms and thus can be managed medically or surgically. [18] Patients with symptoms of angina, arrhythmias, or heart failure benefit from surgical repair. During surgery, true aneurysms can be seen to collapse fully during left ventricular decompression.",
