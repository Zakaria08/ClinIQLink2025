        "content": "In these cases, anticoagulation therapy can prevent formation of dangerous clots or prevent growth of clots. The decision to begin therapeutic anticoagulation often involves the use of multiple bleeding risk predictable outcome tools as non-invasive pre-test stratifications due to the potential for bleeds while on blood thinning agents. Among these tools are HAS-BLED, ATRIA, HEMORR2HAGES, and CHA2DS2-VASc. The risk of bleeding using the aforementioned risk assessment tools must then be weighed against thrombotic risk in order to formally determine patient's overall benefit in starting anticoagulation therapy.",

First, given that the dollars being spent out of pocket are so significant, there are some products and some providers whose primary motivation is monetary. Patients can spend significant dollars based on false promises or claims. Second, patients can postpone effective therapy or treatment by turning to CAM modalities exclusive of conventional approaches. This time can be significant in the treatment of many patients\u2019 diseases. Factors that should increase suspicion for potential misuse are listed in Table 13.6.

        "content": "DOACs offer several advantages over traditional warfarin therapy. One key benefit is that DOACs, unlike warfarin, do not require routine monitoring, making them more convenient for patients. Additionally, these agents have minimal interactions with food, simplifying treatment regimens. DOACs reach therapeutic levels within a few hours of ingestion, providing a rapid onset of action. Overall, DOACs offer a compelling option for anticoagulation therapy due to their ease of use and favorable safety profile.",
