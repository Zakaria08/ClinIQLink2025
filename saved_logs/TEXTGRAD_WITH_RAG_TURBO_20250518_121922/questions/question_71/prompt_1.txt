Document 1 (Title: Obstentrics_Williams): With these methods, some diagnose selective fetal-growth restriction if the AC measurements difer more than 20 mm or if the estimated fetal weight diference is 20 percent or more. That said, several diferent weight disparities between twins have been used to deine discordancy. Accumulated data suggest that weight discordancy greater than 25 to 30 percent most accurately predicts an adverse perinatal outcome. At Parkland, Hollier and coworkers (1999) retrospectively evaluated 1370 delivered twin pairs and stratiied twin weight discordancy in 5-percent increments within a range of 15 to 40 percent. They found that the incidence of respiratory distress syndrome, intraventricular hemorrhage, seizures, periventricular leukomalacia, sepsis, and necrotizing enterocolitis rose directly with the degree of weight discordancy. Rates of these conditions grew substantially if discordancy exceeded 25 percent. The relative risk of fetal death increased significantly to 5.6 if discordancy was more
Document 2 (Title: Diagnostic Testing Accuracy: Sensitivity, Specificity, Predictive Values and Likelihood Ratios -- Issues of Concern -- Application Exercise): Let’s calculate the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, LR+, and LR-. We first can start with a 2X2 Table. The information above allows us to enter the values in the table below. Notice that values in blue cells were not provided, but we can get them based on the numbers above and the utilization of total cells. See Image. Diagnostic Testing Accuracy Table 2. The provider found that a total of 384 individuals actually had the disease, but how accurate was the blood test? Results: Sensitivity Sensitivity=(True Positives (A))/(True Positives (A)+False Negatives (C)) Sensitivity=(369 (A))/(369(A)+15 (C)) Sensitivity=369/384 Sensitivity=0.961 Specificity Specificity=(True Negatives (D))/(True Negatives (D)+False Positives (B)) Specificity=(558 (D))/(558(D)+58 (B)) Specificity=558/616 Specificity=0.906 Positive Predictive Value PPV =(True Positives (A))/(True Positives (A)+False Positives (B)) PPV =(369  (A))/(369 (A)+58(B)) PPV =369/427 PPV =0.864 Negative Predictive Value
Document 3 (Title: Acute respiratory distress syndrome): The primary treatment involves mechanical ventilation together with treatments directed at the underlying cause. Ventilation strategies include using low volumes and low pressures. If oxygenation remains insufficient, lung recruitment maneuvers and neuromuscular blockers may be used. If these are insufficient, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) may be an option. The syndrome is associated with a death rate between 35 and 50%. Globally, ARDS affects more than 3 million people a year. The condition was first described in 1967. Although the terminology of "adult respiratory distress syndrome" has at times been used to differentiate ARDS from "infant respiratory distress syndrome" in newborns, the international consensus is that "acute respiratory distress syndrome" is the best term because ARDS can affect people of all ages. There are separate diagnostic criteria for children and those in areas of the world with fewer resources.

What are the most effective methods to accurately predict the outcome of acute respiratory distress syndrome in children with cancer?
