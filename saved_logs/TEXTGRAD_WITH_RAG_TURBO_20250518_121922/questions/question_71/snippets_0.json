        "content": "The primary treatment involves mechanical ventilation together with treatments directed at the underlying cause. Ventilation strategies include using low volumes and low pressures. If oxygenation remains insufficient, lung recruitment maneuvers and neuromuscular blockers may be used. If these are insufficient, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) may be an option. The syndrome is associated with a death rate between 35 and 50%. Globally, ARDS affects more than 3 million people a year. The condition was first described in 1967. Although the terminology of \"adult respiratory distress syndrome\" has at times been used to differentiate ARDS from \"infant respiratory distress syndrome\" in newborns, the international consensus is that \"acute respiratory distress syndrome\" is the best term because ARDS can affect people of all ages. There are separate diagnostic criteria for children and those in areas of the world with fewer resources.",

        "title": "Predicting respiratory distress by thin-layer chromatography of the newborn gastric aspirate.",
        "content": "The analysis of gastric fluid from newborns for lecithin/sphingomyelin (L/S) ratio evaluation is useful in determining whether respiratory distress will follow an early delivery. Without exception, the L/S ratios obtained on 14 gastric aspirates paralleled and were slightly higher than intrapartum values obtained from corresponding amniotic fluids (5.6 vs 3.7). Of 46 normal infants, only 1 had a gastric aspirate L/S ratio less than 2:1. No false positive results were found. The obstetrician can easily obtain gastric fluid at delivery, and by ordering an L/S ratio determination, the neonatologist can have an estimation of lung surfactant levels within 2 hours after birth. In cases where true respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) must be differentiated from other problems of respiratory distress, this information can assist in the early management of patients with RDS. Even after the development of RDS, the procedure offers a prognostic tool which the clinician can use in discussing the outcome with the parents.",
