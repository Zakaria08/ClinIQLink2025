        "content": "Outcomes Early studies had shown survival benefit with use of ECMO for people in acute respiratory failure especially in the setting of acute respiratory distress syndrome. A registry maintained by ELSO of nearly 51,000 people that have received ECMO has reported outcomes with 75% survival for neonatal respiratory failure, 56% survival for pediatric respiratory failure, and 55% survival for adult respiratory failure. Other observational and uncontrolled clinical trials have reported survival rates from 50 to 70%. These reported survival rates are better than historical survival rates. Even though ECMO is used for a range of conditions with varying mortality rates, early detection is key to prevent the progression of deterioration and increase survival outcomes. In the United Kingdom, veno-venous ECMO deployment is concentrated in designated ECMO centers to potentially improve care and promote better outcomes.",

        "content": "With these methods, some diagnose selective fetal-growth restriction if the AC measurements difer more than 20 mm or if the estimated fetal weight diference is 20 percent or more. That said, several diferent weight disparities between twins have been used to deine discordancy. Accumulated data suggest that weight discordancy greater than 25 to 30 percent most accurately predicts an adverse perinatal outcome. At Parkland, Hollier and coworkers (1999) retrospectively evaluated 1370 delivered twin pairs and stratiied twin weight discordancy in 5-percent increments within a range of 15 to 40 percent. They found that the incidence of respiratory distress syndrome, intraventricular hemorrhage, seizures, periventricular leukomalacia, sepsis, and necrotizing enterocolitis rose directly with the degree of weight discordancy. Rates of these conditions grew substantially if discordancy exceeded 25 percent. The relative risk of fetal death increased significantly to 5.6 if discordancy was more",
