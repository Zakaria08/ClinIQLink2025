Document 1 (Title: Biochemistry_Lippinco): Choose the ONE best answer. .1. A 30-year-old woman of Northern European ancestry presents with progressive dyspnea (shortness of breath). She denies the use of cigarettes. Family history reveals that her sister also has problems with her lungs. Which one of the following etiologies most likely explains this patient’s pulmonary symptoms? A. Deficiency in dietary vitamin C B. Deficiency of α1-antitrypsin C. Deficiency of prolyl hydroxylase D. Decreased elastase activity E. Increased collagenase activity
Document 2 (Title: Surgery for hyperthyroidism: hemithyroidectomy plus contralateral resection or bilateral resection? A prospective randomized study of postoperative complications and long-term results.): Fifty consecutive patients undergoing surgical treatment for hyperthyroidism were randomized to have either bilateral subtotal resection (n = 23) or hemithyroidectomy plus contralateral resection (n = 27). No significant differences in operating time or intra-operative bleeding were found. No postoperative bleeding and no temporary or persistent recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis occurred. Four patients who underwent bilateral resection and 2 patients who had hemithyroidectomy resection needed temporary calcium supplementation, and the serum calcium concentrations were slightly lower during the first few postoperative days in the patient undergoing hemithyroidectomy/resection. No persistent hypocalcemia occurred in either of the groups. At follow-up 3-4 years (mean 3.6 years) postoperatively, 1 patient in the bilateral resection group developed recurrent hyperthyroidism; no patients in the hemithyroidectomy/resection group developed recurrent hyperthyroidism. Twelve (44%) patients in the hemithyroidectomy/resection group and 8 (35%) patients in the bilateral resection group needed thyroxine supplementation because of a rise in thyroid stimulating hormone concentration combined with clinical signs of hypothyroidism that developed during follow-up. Hyperthyroidism can be treated by hemithyroidectomy plus contralateral resection without increasing the risk of complications. The results also suggest that when using this method, a slightly larger thyroid remnant should be left to avoid an increase in the incidence of hypothyroidism postoperatively.
Document 3 (Title: Papillary thyroid cancer): Arguments for total thyroidectomy are: Reduced risk of recurrence, if central compartment nodes are removed at the original surgery. 30-85% of papillary carcinoma is multifocal disease. Hemithyroidectomy may leave disease in the other lobe. However, multifocal disease in the remnant lobe may not necessarily become clinically significant or serve as a detriment to patient survival. Ease of monitoring with thyroglobulin (sensitivity for picking up recurrence is increased in presence of total thyroidectomy, and ablation of the remnant normal thyroid by low dose radioiodine 131 after following a low iodine diet (LID). Ease of detection of metastatic disease by thyroid and neck node ultrasound. Post-operative complications at high-volume thyroid surgery centers with experienced surgeons are comparable to that of hemithyroidectomy. Arguments for hemithyroidectomy:

A 38-year-old woman underwent a hemithyroidectomy for localized thyroid disease. Following the procedure, what symptoms is she most likely to experience? Consider common postoperative complications specific to hemithyroidectomy.
