Document 1 (Title: Individual consistency in behavioral states in neonates.): In this study we identified consistent characteristics of the sleep-wake state of newborn infants. Forty-one normal, full-term infants were observed in a warmer-skin temperature maintained at 36.1 degree C--located in a sound-attenuated room for 1 hr during 2 successive mid-feeding periods. The infant's state was recorded on a check-list every 10 sec using the following categories for sleep and wakefulness: Quiet Sleep A, Quiet Sleep B, Active Sleep Without REM, Active Sleep With REM, Active Sleep With Dense REM, Drowsy, Alert Inactivity, WAKING Activity, Fussing, Crying, and Indefinite State. Immediately following the completion of each observation, the 2 observers made independent judgments of the degree of organization shown by the infant, using a 6-point scale. Over the two 1-hr observations, only Quiet Sleep A, Quiet Sleep B, and Crying showed any consistency. Active Sleep as typically defined showed no consistency whatsoever. However, 2 of the 3 components of Active Sleep were significantly reliability measures for the 2 observations; in sleeping infants all 3 components of active sleep showed high reliability. These results indicate that Active Sleep may be a composite of at least 3 meaningful categories. To look at overall state organization in the neonate, including both sleep and wake states, we considered Active Sleep as 3 separate states and then combined the resulting 11 behavioral states into derived clusters such that each combination of states showed a test-retest reliability above .52. With these 5 state clusters we viewed each infant's state behaviors in terms of a profile depicting the percent of time spent in each state cluster. We found a close association between these profiles and the subjective judgments of sleep-wake state organization made by the observers. The results clearly indicate that a 1-hr observation provides reliable information on individual sleep-wake states in the newborn.
Document 2 (Title: Sudden Infant Death Syndrome -- Deterrence and Patient Education): Medical professionals must be aware of current recommendations for safe sleeping practices and SIDS prevention: do not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs during pregnancy, place the infant on the back to sleep, allow the infant to sleep in his or her own crib in the same room as caregivers, and use a firm and flat surface in a safety-approved crib. Keep soft bedding or objects such as blankets, pillows, bumper pads, or toys out of the sleeping environment. Avoid covering the infant's head and avoid overheating. Avoid second-hand smoke. Smokers should change clothes and wash their hair before coming in contact with the infant. Infants and caregivers benefit from learning to use a pacifier at bedtime - Do Not Prop bottles in the baby's mouth! Breastfeeding and immunizations are beneficial.
Document 3 (Title: Pathology_Robbins): Among the potential environmental causes, prone sleeping position, sleeping on soft surfaces, and thermal stress are possibly the most important modifiable risk factors for SIDS. Many studies have clearly shown increased risk for SIDS in infants who sleep in a prone position, prompting the American Academy of Pediatrics to recommend placing healthy infants on their backs when laying them down to sleep. This “Back to Sleep” campaign has resulted in substantial decreases in SIDS-related deaths since its inception in 1994. The prone position increases the infant’s vulnerability to one or more recognized noxious stimuli (hypoxia, hypercarbia, and thermal stress) during sleep. In addition, the prone position also is associated with decreased arousal responsiveness compared with the supine position.

What specific measures can be taken to ensure the nighttime safety of a 3-month-old infant, minimizing any risks associated with sleep?

Options:
A. Placing the infant in a supine position on a firm mattress while sleeping
B. Keeping the infant covered and maintaining a high room temperature
C. Application of a device to maintain the sleeping position
D. Avoiding pacifier use during sleep
