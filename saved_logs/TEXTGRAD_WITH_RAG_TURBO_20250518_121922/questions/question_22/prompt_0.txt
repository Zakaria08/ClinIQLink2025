Document 1 (Title: Interaction effects of d-amphetamine treatment and ambient temperature on rat's food intake.): The "thermoregulatory theory of hunger" posits that rats placed in a cold environment should increase the amount of food intake, while rats placed in a hot environment should decrease their food intake. d-Amphetamine causes hyperthermia among rats kept at warm ambient temperature, and results in hypothermia among animals kept in a cold environment. d-Amphetamine-caused-hyperthermia should therefore result in decreased eating behavior, and d-amphetamine-caused hypothermia should result in increased eating behavior. One must take into account the fact that d-amphetamine is an anorexic drug. The interaction between (a) ambient temperature, (b) body temperature and (c) food intake were tested on groups of rats injected with various doses of d-amphetamine (1.5-15 mg/kg) and placed in ambient temperatures ranging from 4-37 degrees C. No increase in food intake was revealed under any dosage or temperature condition. The decrease in food intake found with d-amphetamine treated animals could not be explained in the "thermoregulatory theory of hunger". Our data indicate that d-amphetamine anorexic effects and thermal effects are mediated by different mechanisms.

Document 3 (Title: Pregnancy Medications -- Clinical Significance -- Previous Pregnancy-Risk Categories): These have been in use since 1979 and are defined as follows: Category A: No risk in human studies (studies in pregnant women have not demonstrated a risk to the fetus during the first trimester). Category B: No risk in animal studies (there are no adequate studies in humans, but animal studies did not demonstrate a risk to the fetus). Category C: Risk cannot be ruled out. There are no satisfactory studies in pregnant women, but animal studies demonstrated a risk to the fetus; potential benefits of the drug may outweigh the risks. Category D: Evidence of risk (studies in pregnant women have demonstrated a risk to the fetus; potential benefits of the drug may outweigh the risks). Category X: Contraindicated (studies in pregnant women have demonstrated a risk to the fetus, and/or human or animal studies have shown fetal abnormalities; risks of the drug outweigh the potential benefits).
