Document 2 (Title: Oxcarbazepine): Research has investigated the use of oxcarbazepine as a mood stabilizer in bipolar disorder, with further evidence needed to fully assess its suitability. It may be beneficial in trigeminal neuralgia. Pregnancy Oxcarbazepine is listed as pregnancy category C. There is limited data analyzing the impact of oxcarbazepine on a human fetus. Animal studies have shown increased fetal abnormalities in pregnant rats and rabbits exposed to oxcarbazepine during pregnancy. In addition, oxcarbazepine is structurally similar to carbamazepine, which is considered to be teratogenic in humans (pregnancy category D). Oxcarbazepine should only be used during pregnancy if the benefits justify the risks. Pregnant women on oxcarbazepine should be closely monitored, as plasma levels of the active metabolite licarbazepine have been shown to potentially decrease during pregnancy.
Document 3 (Title: Pregnancy Medications -- Clinical Significance -- Previous Pregnancy-Risk Categories): These have been in use since 1979 and are defined as follows: Category A: No risk in human studies (studies in pregnant women have not demonstrated a risk to the fetus during the first trimester). Category B: No risk in animal studies (there are no adequate studies in humans, but animal studies did not demonstrate a risk to the fetus). Category C: Risk cannot be ruled out. There are no satisfactory studies in pregnant women, but animal studies demonstrated a risk to the fetus; potential benefits of the drug may outweigh the risks. Category D: Evidence of risk (studies in pregnant women have demonstrated a risk to the fetus; potential benefits of the drug may outweigh the risks). Category X: Contraindicated (studies in pregnant women have demonstrated a risk to the fetus, and/or human or animal studies have shown fetal abnormalities; risks of the drug outweigh the potential benefits).
