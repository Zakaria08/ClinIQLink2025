== Original Prompt ==
Question: An investigator is studying the function of the lateral nucleus of the hypothalamus in an experimental animal. Using a viral vector, the genes encoding chloride-conducting channelrhodopsins are injected into this nucleus. Photostimulation of the channels causes complete inhibition of action potential generation. Persistent photostimulation is most likely to result in which of the following abnormalities in these animals?
Options:
A. Hypothermia
B. Hyperthermia
C. Polydipsia
D. Anorexia

== Feedback ==
Incorrect answer: The answer should be "D" for anorexia, and the prompt should clarify the role of the lateral hypothalamus in feeding behavior to guide the correct choice.

== Improved Full Prompt ==
An investigator conducts research on the lateral function in animals. What abnormalities might arise as a result of this study?

Options:
A. Hypothermia
B. Hyperthermia
C. Polydipsia
D. Anorexia
