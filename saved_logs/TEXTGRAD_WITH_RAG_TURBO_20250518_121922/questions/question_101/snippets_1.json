Overprescribing may contribute to increasing future antibiotic resistance to the drug, so a pharmacy consult is necessary for the prescriber to ensure directed therapy. The documentation already exists regarding increased resistance to metronidazole in the treatment of C. difficile infections. Also, prescribers, nurses, and pharmacists should routinely educate patients to abstain from alcoholic beverages while taking metronidazole, which will help lead to fewer disulfiram reaction symptoms; nursing will play a role in this monitoring and for other potential adverse effects. The patient should also be informed by the health care provider of the possible change in urine color while on this medicine. The team of health professionals, including physicians, physician assistants, nurses, and pharmacists, must work together to provide the best care for these patients when using metronidazole in any formulation.

        "title": "Pharmacokinetics and therapeutic efficacy of metronidazole at different dosages.",
        "content": "Metronidazole, a drug effective against certain protozoal and anaerobic infections, was given female patients with Trichomoniasis urogenitalis. Group I received twice daily 250 mg of metronidazole (supplied as 250 mg tablets Vagimid). Group II received in a single dose 1.0 g (4 tablets); and group III, 2.0 g (8 tablets). Serum and urine metronidazole levels were measured polarographically. Kinetic parameters were determined from the measured values of the concentration time curve by a computing program. An exact control of the therapeutic result was carried out. In all patients peak serum levels occurred within 1-3 hr and averaged 5.1 +/- 1.7 microgram/ml after 250 mg doses, 19.6 +/- 3.8 microgram/ml after 1.0 g doses and 40.6 +/- 9.3 microgram/ml after 2.0 g doses. About 35% of the administered dose was recovered in the urine in 12 hr and about 50% in 24 hr. Metronidazole shows protein binding of 10-20% equally in vivo and in vitro. Minimum trichomonacidic concentrations of nearly 1 microgram/ml were still present 12 hr after oral application of 250 mg metronidazole, and 24 hr to 36 hr, respectively after 1.0 g and 2.0 g daily doses. The cure rate was 100%. No serious side effects ocurred in any of the patients.",

        "content": "Nitroimidazole antibiotics From the chemistry perspective, nitroimidazole antibiotics can be classified according to the location of the nitro functional group. Structures with names 4- and 5-nitroimidazole are equivalent from the perspective of drugs since these tautomers readily interconvert. Drugs of the 5-nitro variety include metronidazole, tinidazole, nimorazole, dimetridazole, pretomanid, ornidazole, megazol, and azanidazole. Drugs based on 2-nitromidazoles include benznidazole. Nitroimidazole antibiotics have been used to combat anaerobic bacterial and parasitic infections. Perhaps the most common example is metronidazole. Other heterocycles such as nitrothiazoles (thiazole) are also used for this purpose. Nitroheterocycles may be reductively activated in hypoxic cells, and then undergo redox recycling or decompose to toxic products. References Disulfiram-like drugs",
