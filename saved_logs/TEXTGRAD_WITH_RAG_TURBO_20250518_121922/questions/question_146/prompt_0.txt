Document 1 (Title: Isolation of keratinophilic fungi from the dust of ferry boats and trains in Italy.): The occurrence of fungi of the genera Epidermophyton, Microsporum, Trichophyton and Chrysosporium in dust collected from 10 ferry boats and 11 railway cars in Italy was studied. Ferry boats: 101 colonies of fungi were isolated. Of the dermatophytes, E. floccosum represented 2.0% of all the colonies isolated, M. canis 3.0%, M. gypseum 5.0% and Tr. mentagrophytes represented 2.0%. E. floccosum was isolated from 2 ferry boats, M. canis from 3, M. gypseum from 4 and Tr. mentagrophytes from 2. Only two ferry boats appeared to be free of pathogenic fungi. Of all the species isolated, Chr. pannorum was the most numerous (45.4%). In all five species of Chrysosporium were isolated. Railway cars: The final destination of the trains, coming from various cities, was Rome's Termini Station. 336 strains were isolated. The following species were found: E. floccosum 3%, Tr. mentagrophytes 4.8%, Tr. tonsurans 0.3%, Tr. ajelloi 0.6%, Trichophyton spp. 3%, M. canis 5% and M. gypseum 1.5%. Seven different species of Chrysosporium were isolated. Chr. pannorum was the most numerous one (71% of all). Regarding the occurrence of dermatophytes, E. floccosum was isolated from 8 of the 11 trains examined, M. canis from 10, M. gypseum from 4, Tr. mentagrophytes from 8 and Tr. tonsurans from only 1 of the trains. All of the trains were positive for pathogenic fungi, ranging from a minimum of 2 species to a maximum of 4.
Document 2 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): The topical imidazoles, which include clotrimazole, econazole, ketoconazole, luliconazole, miconazole, oxiconazole, sertaconazole, and sulconazole, have a wide range of activity against dermatophytes (Epidermophyton, Microsporum, and Trichophyton) and yeasts, including Candida albicans and Pityrosporum orbiculare (see Chapter 48). Miconazole (Monistat, Micatin) is available for topical application as a cream or lotion and as vaginal cream or suppositories for use in vulvovaginal candidiasis. Clotrimazole (Lotrimin, Mycelex) is available for topical application to the skin as a cream or lotion and as vaginal cream and tablets for use in vulvovaginal candidiasis. Efinaconazole (Jublia) is available as a 10% solution for the treatment of onychomycosis of the toenails. Daily application to affected toenails should be continued for 48 weeks.
Document 3 (Title: Dermatophyte): Trichophyton: rubrum, tonsurans, mentagrophytes, verrucosum, and schoenlenii Microsporum: canis, audouinii, and gypseum Epidermophyton: floccosum About 76% of the dermatophyte species isolated from humans are Trichophyton rubrum. 27% are Trichophyton mentagrophytes 7% are Trichophyton verrucosum 3% are Trichophyton tonsurans Infrequently isolated (less than 1%) are Epidermophyton floccosum, Microsporum audouinii, Microsporum canis, Microsporum equinum, Microsporum nanum, Microsporum versicolor, Trichophyton equinum, Trichophyton kanei, Trichophyton raubitschekii, and Trichophyton violaceum. The mixture of species is quite different in domesticated animals and pets (see ringworm for details). Epidemiology Since dermatophytes are found worldwide, infections by these fungi are extremely common. Infections occur more in males than in females, as the predominantly female hormone, progesterone, inhibits the growth of dermatophyte fungi.

Please identify which of the following fungi are considered dermatophytes.

Options:
1. Epidermophyton floccosum
2. Aspergillus fumigatum
3. Microsporum canis
4. Trichophyton mentagrophytes
5. Candida albicans
