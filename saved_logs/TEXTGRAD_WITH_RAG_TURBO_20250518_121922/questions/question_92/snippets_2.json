        "content": "Currently, splenectomy followed by long-term follow-up is the recommended treatment for LCA, given its malignant potential. Since LCA can be associated with splenomegaly, performing a laparoscopic splenectomy (LS) can be challenging. It should only be performed by an experienced surgeon with particular attention to prevent splenic capsule rupture and, consequently, any tumor cell dissemination. A study done by Cai et al. demonstrated that it is feasible and safe to do LS for patients with LCA. Conversion to hand-assisted laparoscopic splenectomy (HALS) or even open surgery may be necessary when dealing with cases having extensive adhesions or massive splenomegaly, especially in patients with malignant tumors.
