Document 1 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): failure to appreciate the solid or debris-filled contents of a pseudocyst that appears to be fluid filled on CT scan, and a failure to document true adherence with an adjacent portion of the stomach before attempting transgas-tric internal drainage.If the pseudocyst has failed to resolve with conserva-tive therapy and symptoms persist, internal drainage is usu-ally preferred to external drainage to avoid the complication of a pancreaticocutaneous fistula. Pseudocysts communicate with the pancreatic ductal system in up to 80% of cases,206 so external drainage creates a pathway for pancreatic duct leak-age to and through the catheter exit site. Internal drainage may be performed with either endoscopic methods (transgastric or transduodenal puncture and multiple stent placements, with or without a nasocystic irrigation catheter), or surgical methods (a true cystoenterostomy, biopsy of cyst wall, and evacuation of all debris and contents). Surgical options include a cystogastros-tomy
Document 2 (Title: Intraabominal Abscesses -- Treatment / Management): The approach to abscess treatment varies by anatomic location. While a subdiaphragmatic abscess can be drained percutaneously, a pelvic abscess is accessed transrectally or transvaginally. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided drainage provides a safe and effective minimally invasive treatment option. [69] [70] Transesophageal and transgastric approaches have been used for a subphrenic abscess. [71] Splenic abscesses have been traditionally treated with splenectomy, but percutaneous drainage has been correlated with lower mortality and complication rates. [72] Results from a study showed that abscess size, age, inflammatory markers, leukocytosis, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were predictive of the need for surgical intervention due to failure of pharmacologic treatment. [73]
Document 3 (Title: Operative assessment of intestinal viability.): Acute intestinal ischemia and infarction remain serious clinical problems despite early operative intervention. Accurate intraoperative assessment of intestinal viability is essential in determining the limits of resection in patients with intestinal infarction. Clinical features of bowel viability such as color and peristalsis do not correlate uniformly with bowel survival, and as a result, several techniques have been developed to assess intestinal blood flow at the time of operation. The requirements of an ideal viability test are: 1. The technique must have ready availability, preferably in every operating theater dealing with abdominal emergencies. 2. The necessary equipment must not be cumbersome or require specialized personnel. 3. The method must be accurate with a minimum of false-negative results and, more importantly, few false positives. A false-negative results leaves in situ nonviable bowel, which may lead to early perforation and late stricturing. This situation may be recoverable with further surgical intervention, however. On the other hand, a false-positive assessment of bowel viability results in the resection of potentially recoverable intestine, which is lost forever and may represent a vital difference for morbidity-mortality and long-term nutrition. 4. The technique must be objective and be reproducible. 5. The method must be cost effective. To date, only two tests have found widespread acceptance and clinical applicability: fluorescein assessment and Doppler studies either with ultrasound or as refined in laser velocimetry. Although other techniques may be of some value today or in the future, the most practical approach would appear to be to use fluorescein assessment under a modified Wood's lamp as the initial method of evaluating intestinal viability and either Doppler ultrasound or perfusion fluorometry for any areas of particularly doubtful viability.

Assess the practical viability and potential obstacles in conducting a transgastric endoscopic splenectomy.
