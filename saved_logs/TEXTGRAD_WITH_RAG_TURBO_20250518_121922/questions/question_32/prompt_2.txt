Document 1 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): Ahmed A. Negm, MD, & Daniel E. Furst, MD twice daily. His symptoms are reduced at this dosage, but he com-plains of significant heartburn that is not controlled by antacids. He is then switched to celecoxib, 200 mg twice daily, and on this regimen his joint symptoms and heartburn resolve. Two years later, he returns with increased joint symptoms. His hands, wrists, elbows, feet, and knees are all now involved and appear swollen, warm, and tender. What therapeutic options should be considered at this time? What are the possible complications? A 48-year-old man presents with complaints of bilateral morning stiffness in his wrists and knees and pain in these joints on exercise. On physical examination, the joints are slightly swollen. The rest of the examination is unremarkable. His laboratory findings are also negative except for slight anemia, elevated erythrocyte sedi-mentation rate, and positive rheumatoid factor. With the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, he is started on a regimen
Document 2 (Title: Schizoaffective Disorder -- History and Physical): Two or more of the following presentations, each present for a significant amount of time during a 1-month period (or less if successfully treated). At least one of these must be from the first three below. Delusions Hallucinations Disorganized speech (e.g., frequent derailment or incoherence). Grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior Negative symptoms (i.e., diminished emotional expression or avolition.) B. Hallucinations and delusions for two or more weeks in the absence of a major mood episode (manic or depressive) during the entire lifetime duration of the illness. C. Symptoms that meet the criteria for a major mood episode are present for most of the total duration of both the active and residual portions of the illness. D. The disturbance is not the result of the effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of misuse or a medication) or another underlying medical condition. The following are specifiers based on the primary mood episode as part of the presentation.
Document 3 (Title: Vertebrobasilar insufficiency): Alternative diagnoses VBI is often considered when a patient complains of dizziness. It is important to distinguish dizziness caused by vertigo from the sensation of being light-headed, as the latter is more commonly a result of other conditions. Brief episodes of vertigo brought on by head movements are more likely to be Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. Alternatively, carotid sinus hypersensitivity can cause episodes of dizziness and collapse on head turning if the neck brushes against clothing. Treatment The main treatment for VBI is to address risk factors for atherosclerosis such as smoking, hypertension and diabetes. Patients are often started on an antiplatelet (e.g. aspirin, clopidogrel) or occasionally an anticoagulant (e.g. warfarin) to reduce the risk of future strokes. Where VBI is causing reproducible symptoms due to stenosis, lifestyle modification to avoid provoking factors (e.g. dehydration, standing rapidly from sitting or lying) may reduce symptoms.

A 69-year-old man presents with frequent episodes of dizziness. What would be the most effective treatment plan to prevent these episodes from occurring in the future?
