Document 1 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): Christian Lüscher, MD A 15-year-old high school student is brought to the emergency department after his parents found him in his room staring at the ceiling and visibly frightened. Earlier that evening, he attended a party but was depressed because his girlfriend just broke up with him. Jerry is failing this year at school and has stopped playing soccer. His parents are also worried about a change in his behavior over the last few months. He has lost interest in school, at times seems depressed, and tells his par-ents that his pocket money is not sufficient. When questioned by the intern, he reports that space-cookies were served at the party. He also says that smoking marijuana has become a habit (three to four joints a week) but denies consumption of alcohol and other drugs. How do you explain the state he was found in? What is the difference between hashish and marijuana? What may be the link to his poor performance at school? Are all drug users necessarily using several drugs?
Document 2 (Title: The impact of illness in adolescence and coping behavior.): The emotional impact of serious illness or injury bears just as much potential for being disabling to an adolescent as does the condition itself. It is also these concerns and the possibilities for difficult behavior on the part of teenagers on the ward which frequently cause staff members to feel at a loss when caring for this reputedly difficult age group. But if one carefully examines the specific developmental stresses of illness and the various coping mechanisms by which the youth may counter them, a logical management approach emerges. To a large degree this approach depends on compensation, intellectualization, displacement and constructive denial but also recognizes that destructive denial, regression and projection do normally and naturally occur at various points in the course of illness and hospitalization and that panic and acting out may also readily occur, but less frequently. The deterence of the more deleterious responses and promotion of the more felicitious dependes on a ward setting which provides for the adolescent's growing need for independence and self-determination; for continued reassurance about body image integrity, for resumption of mastery and control; and for the maintenance or restoration of his sense of self-worth. These goals are achieved by encouraging the youth to be an active partner in his own care; to share in decisions made about his condition; to pursue just as much independent self-management as he can; to actively engage in establishing a peer group with other adolescents in the ward; to continue with his education, socialization, personal interests and outside peer contacts as much as possible; and to feel that the staff respects his dignity and privacy, likes him as a person and appreciates the courage and effort with which he is facing a difficult time.
Document 3 (Title: 4th Time Around): not to use Dylan's songs as a "crutch" for his own songwriting. Later, however, he changed his opinion on the track to become more favourable when he considered Dylan's effort to be more a playful homage. This shift can be seen when he was asked about his opinion on the track in a 1968 Rolling Stone Magazine interview, in which he stated:"I was very paranoid about that. I remember he played it to me when he was in London. He said, what do you think? I said, I don’t like it. I didn’t like it. I was very paranoid. I just didn’t like what I felt I was feeling – I thought it was an out and out skit, you know, but it wasn’t. It was great. I mean he wasn’t playing any tricks on me. I was just going through the bit."

A 16-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his parents due to recent changes in his behavior. They report that he has become more socially withdrawn and spends much of his time in his room. He has also started using the phrase "I don’t want to talk about it" when asked about his feelings or problems. Evaluate which defense mechanisms are likely involved in this teenager's behavior changes.
