Document 1 (Title: Clinical pharmacokinetic properties of the macrolide antibiotics. Effects of age and various pathophysiological states (Part I).): The pharmacokinetic aspects in humans of macrolide antibiotics that are currently or soon to be on the market (i.e. erythromycin, oleandomycin, spiramycin, josamycin, midecamycin, miocamycin, rosaramycin, roxithromycin and azithromycin) are reviewed. Macrolide antibiotics are basic compounds, poorly soluble in water, which are mostly absorbed in the alkaline intestinal environment. They are acid unstable, but the newer semisynthetic derivatives (i.e. roxithromycin and azithromycin) are characterised by increased stability under acidic conditions. Macrolides are highly liposoluble and consequently penetrate well into tissue, especially bronchial secretions, prostatic tissue, middle ear exudates and bone tissues, as evidenced by tissue/serum concentration ratios greater than 1. They do not penetrate well into the CSF. Macrolides undergo extensive biotransformation in the liver. With a few exceptions (e.g. miocamycin), the metabolites of these drugs are characterised by little or no antimicrobial activity. Plasma protein binding is variable from one compound to another. At therapeutic concentrations, protein-bound erythromycin accounts for 80 to 90% of the total drug present in the blood, and the fraction is 95% for roxithromycin. The lowest values of protein-bound fraction are observed for midecamycin and josamycin (about 15%), and intermediate values are reported for spiramycin and miocamycin. However, the clinical relevance of this parameter is not clearly established. Plasma half-life (t1/2) values vary for the macrolides described: erythromycin, oleandomycin, josamycin and miocamycin have a t1/2 ranging from 1 to 2 hours; spiramycin, erythromycin stearate, the mercaptosuccinate salt of propionyl erythromycin and rosaramicin have an intermediate t1/2 (about 7, 6.5, 5 and 4.5 hours, respectively); the newer semisynthetic compounds roxithromycin and azithromycin are characterised by high t1/2 values (i.e. 11 and 41 hours, respectively). Under normal conditions, the major route of elimination is the liver. Renal elimination also takes place but it contributes to total clearance only to a small degree, as evidenced by low renal clearance values. The degree of modification of macrolide pharmacokinetics by renal insufficiency or hepatic disease is usually not considered clinically relevant, and no recommendation for dose modification is necessary in these patients. The pharmacokinetics of macrolides are modified in elderly patients. Accordingly, their use must be accompanied by a closer than usual clinical monitoring of the older patient.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
Document 2 (Title: Acne Vulgaris -- Treatment / Management -- Oral Antibiotics): Oral antibiotics effectively inhibit the growth of C acnes within the pilosebaceous unit. Tetracyclines, in particular, have anti-inflammatory properties, making them the preferred antibiotic for treating acne vulgaris. If tetracyclines are ineffective or not well-tolerated by patients, other antibiotics (such as macrolides, cephalosporins, penicillins, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) may be considered alternatives. [41] To reduce the development of antibiotic resistance, it is necessary to limit the duration of the treatment to the shortest possible period (ideally, 3-4 months). This can be complemented by the concurrent use of a topical retinoid, which can aid in the discontinuation of the antibiotic, or by incorporating the use of benzoyl peroxide. Preferred tetracyclines for acne treatment include doxycycline, minocycline, and sarecycline. Doxycycline and other tetracyclines should not be prescribed to patients who are children aged less than 8 or pregnant women. Long-term treatment with oral antibiotics may lead to tooth discoloration in developing teeth. Moreover, doxycycline can cause gastrointestinal distress, esophagitis, and pseudotumor cerebri (idiopathic intracranial hypertension). Photosensitivity is also one of the adverse effects of oral antibiotics; therefore, sun protective measures are advised while on treatment with tetracyclines.
Document 3 (Title: Whooping cough): Treatment The antibiotics erythromycin, clarithromycin, or azithromycin are typically the recommended treatment. Newer macrolides are frequently recommended due to lower rates of side effects. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) may be used in those with allergies to first-line agents or in infants who have a risk of pyloric stenosis from macrolides. A reasonable guideline is to treat people age >1 year within 3 weeks of cough onset and infants age <1 year and pregnant women within 6 weeks of cough onset. If the person is diagnosed late, antibiotics will not alter the course of the illness, and even without antibiotics, they should no longer be spreading pertussis. When used early, antibiotics decrease the duration of infectiousness, and thus prevent spread. Short-term antibiotics (azithromycin for 3–5 days) are as effective as long-term treatment (erythromycin 10–14 days) in eliminating B. pertussis with fewer and less severe side effects.
