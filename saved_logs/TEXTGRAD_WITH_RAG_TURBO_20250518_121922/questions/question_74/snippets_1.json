        "title": "False pregnancy",
        "content": "Duration of symptoms typically ranges from several weeks to nine months. Causes and mechanism The exact mechanisms behind false pregnancy are not completely understood, but psychological and endocrine components may play a substantial role. Women who experience false pregnancy often experience related feelings of stress, fear, anticipation, and general emotional disturbance. These strong emotions, along with dysfunctional changes in hormonal regulation, can significantly increase prolactin levels. Prolactinemia (high prolactin levels) can lead to many of the symptoms of true pregnancy, such as amenorrhea, galactorrhea, and tender breasts. Heightened activity of the central nervous system may contribute to the abdominal distension, sensations of fetal movement, and assumed contraction pains experienced by many women with false pregnancy.",

Do you suppose such rearrangements are likely to be causative events in the cancers in which they are found, or are they probably just passenger events that are unrelated to the cancer?

        "content": "While every patient with true Bell palsy recovers facial motor function to some extent, many will develop synkinesis, particularly if\u00a0presenting with severe or total hemifacial paralysis. The clinician is responsible for identifying these aberrant facial movements, as patients may not recognize the difference between the initial flaccid weakness and the hypertonicity that follows it, characterizing the chronic movement disorder as a continuation of the acute palsy rather than as a different, but related, clinical entity. Nevertheless, persistent facial asymmetry and mimetic dysfunction can have major adverse impacts on quality of life, causing patients to seek care. Physiotherapy and chemodenervation are sufficient for most individuals, although operative options do exist for patients who are dissatisfied with the results of conservative measures or who would prefer to avoid a prolonged course of regular botulinum toxin injections.",
