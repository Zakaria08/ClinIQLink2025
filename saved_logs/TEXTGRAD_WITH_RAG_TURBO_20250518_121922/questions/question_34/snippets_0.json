If a child remains well after a period of observation, with no spreading of the rash, a normal platelet count and no physical signs or signs of infection on blood tests (raised white cell count and inflammatory markers), they may be discharged home. If IMD is likely, urgent intravenous antibiotics as per local guidelines should be administered, with close observations after admission to the ward or intensive care unit. Some patients may receive a dose of antibiotics\u00a0pre-hospital if high clinical suspicion of IMD is present.

        "content": "Antibiotics Antibiotic therapy is empirical, it is given until culture and sensitivity results are obtained. The empirical therapy should be effective against both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria species commonly involved in Ludwig's Angina. Only when culture and sensitivity results return should therapy be tailored to the specific requirements of the patient. Empirical coverage should consist of either a penicillin with a B-lactamase inhibitor such as amoxicillin/ticarcillin with clavulanic acid or a Beta-lactamase resistant antibiotic such as cefoxitin, cefuroxime, imipenem or meropenem. This should be given in combination with a drug effective against anaerobes such as clindamycin or metronidazole. Parenteral antibiotics are suggested until the patient is no longer febrile for at least 48 hours. Oral therapy can then commence to last for 2 weeks, with amoxicillin with clavulanic acid, clindamycin, ciprofloxacin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, or metronidazole.",

        "title": "Is noninvasive risk stratification sufficient, or should all patients undergo cardiac catheterization and angiography after a myocardial infarction?",
        "content": "From the foregoing discussion, it becomes apparent that although noninvasive risk stratification is a reasonable approach to assessment of patients following an uncomplicated myocardial infarction, the performance of early cardiac catheterization and angiography on nearly all such patients is not unreasonable and may in fact be the most practical approach. The basis for this rationalization may be summarized as follows: 1. Many subgroups will need early catheterization anyway a. Myocardial infarction complicated by recurrent ischemia, heart failure, or complex ventricular arrhythmias b. Patients receiving thrombolytic treatment c. \"Young\" patients (less than 50 years old?) d. \"Older\" patients (over ages 65 to 70?) in otherwise good medical condition e. Patients unable to exercise f. Patients with abnormal or inconclusive noninvasive test results (approximately 70 percent of patients) 2. Cardiac catheterization and angiography as a single test provides the two most powerful prognostic variables following myocardial infarction, namely, the extent of coronary artery disease and residual left ventricular function. This knowledge is reassuring to both physician and patient and allows for planning of optimal long-term management. 3. Certain limitations exist in noninvasive risk assessment strategies. 4. This approach need not be significantly more costly, if all tests are used wisely. The major risk inherent in the definition of the extent of coronary artery disease in all survivors of acute myocardial infarction might be the performance of unnecessary revascularization procedures (percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty or coronary bypass surgery). The burden rests with the individual clinician to (1) collect all useful and necessary data; (2) assess reliability and accuracy of various tests available at one's own institution; (3) avoid performing unnecessary and repetitive tests; (4) interpret the data in the proper context; and (5) counsel patients appropriately, correctly, and judiciously about their prognosis and therapeutic options. In this manner, all patients who might benefit appropriately from revascularization can be discovered early and offered this therapeutic option. Other patients can also be managed more appropriately; for example, those who are truly at very low risk (normal left ventricular function and either normal coronary arteries or \"mild\" coronary artery disease). However, it is most important to avoid unnecessary revascularization procedures. Although this discussion has focused on noninvasive and invasive testing following myocardial infarction, it is necessary to emphasize that comprehensive management of coronary artery disease and its complications should not be neglected in these patients; for example, control or amelioration of risk factors for coronary artery disease is mandatory in all these patients, and in their families as well.",
