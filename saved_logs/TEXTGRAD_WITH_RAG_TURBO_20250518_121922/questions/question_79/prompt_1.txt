Document 1 (Title: Oxygen therapy): Immunological effects Hyperoxic environments have been observed to decrease granulocyte rolling and diapedesis in specific circumstances in humans. In regard to anaerobic infections, cases of necrotizing fasciitis have been observed to require fewer debridement operations and have improvement in regard to mortality in patients treated with hyperbaric oxygen therapy. This may stem from oxygen intolerance of otherwise anaerobic microorganisms. Oxidative Stress Sustained exposure to oxygen may overwhelm the body's capacity to deal with oxidative stress. Rates of oxidative stress appears to be influenced by both oxygen concentration and length of exposure, with general toxicity observed to occur within hours in certain hyperoxic conditions.
Document 2 (Title: [Hyperbaric oxygenation in the treatment of necrotizing fasciitis].): The authors present the results of treatment provided to 11 patients with necrotizing fasciitis who were after a surgical operation and after administration of antibiotics treated in a hyperbaric chamber. A total of 8 patients (82%) recovered completely. The authors discuss the theory of action of hyperbaric oxygen on microorganisms and draw attention to the possible reduction of mortality of this serious disease when using hyperbaric oxygenation. The latter is considered an important auxiliary method which supplements surgical treatment, rational antibiotic therapy and in particular careful intensive care.
Document 3 (Title: Necrotizing Fasciitis -- Treatment / Management -- Soft-tissue Reconstruction): The plastic surgeon should be consulted once all the necrotic tissue is removed and there is evidence of granulation tissue. In most cases, primary closure is not possible, and hence the plastic surgeon may be required to reconstruct the soft tissues and close the wound with a muscle flap. If there is no adequate natural skin available for a skin graft, then one may need to use artificial skin. Another method of treatment includes the use of hyperbaric oxygenation. While the literature does suggest this modality can be used, most of these patients are in the intensive care unit attached to a variety of medical equipment, thus making the journey to the hyperbaric oxygen therapy facility difficult. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy may be effective for small wounds, but there is no evidence that this therapy improves healing or prolongs life for large wounds. Finally, it should be noted that hyperbaric oxygen therapy is an adjunctive treatment and not a substitute for surgical debridement. Hyperbaric oxygen treatment may be useful when the patient is stable. Some data show that this treatment can help reduce mortality. Hyperbaric oxygen is not a substitute for surgery but a complementary treatment.

What are the recommendations and evidence regarding the use of hyperbaric oxygenation therapy in treating necrotizing fasciitis?
