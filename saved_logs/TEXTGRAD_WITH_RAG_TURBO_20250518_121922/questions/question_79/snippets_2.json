        "title": "Management of perineal necrotizing fasciitis (Fournier's gangrene).",
        "content": "Eleven cases of perineal necrotizing fasciitis were treated in the Department of Surgery, University of Turku, Finland. In 10 cases the diagnosis was made on the basis of the fulminating progression of the infection to scrotal gangrene, identification of multiple underlying pathogenic organisms and toxaemia. In one female patient a corresponding infection developed in the labia majora. Each patient suffered nonspecific symptoms before the gangrene became evident. The management included surgical debridement of the necrotic tissue with incisions and drainage of the involved areas, antibiotic therapy and hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) treatment. The infection originated from the anorectal area in 5 patients, 1 patient had sustained scrotal trauma and in 5 cases the underlying condition was unknown. Colostomy was performed in 6 patients. One patient died 2 days after the admission. All the infections proved to be multimicrobial. Hyperbaric oxygenation was employed as a therapeutic adjunct in the present series, but it should neither replace nor delay surgical intervention. The key points in the management include early diagnosis with prompt surgical debridement and antibiotic therapy. After healthy granulation has appeared, the healing time can be shortened with reconstructive surgical procedures.",

        "title": "Necrotizing Fasciitis -- Treatment / Management -- Soft-tissue Reconstruction",
        "content": "The plastic surgeon should be consulted once all the necrotic tissue is removed and there is evidence of granulation tissue. In most cases, primary closure is not possible, and hence the plastic surgeon may be required to reconstruct the soft tissues and close the wound with a muscle flap. If there is no adequate natural skin available for a skin graft, then one may need to use artificial skin. Another method of treatment includes the use of hyperbaric oxygenation. While the literature does suggest this modality can be used, most of these patients are in the intensive care unit attached to a variety of medical equipment, thus making the journey to the hyperbaric oxygen therapy facility difficult. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy may be effective for small wounds, but there is no evidence that this therapy improves healing or prolongs life for large wounds. Finally, it should be noted that\u00a0hyperbaric\u00a0oxygen therapy\u00a0is an adjunctive treatment and not a substitute for surgical debridement. Hyperbaric oxygen\u00a0treatment may be useful when the patient is stable. Some data show that this treatment can help reduce mortality.\u00a0Hyperbaric oxygen is not a substitute for surgery but a complementary treatment.",
