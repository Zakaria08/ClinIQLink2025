== Original Prompt ==
Question: A 31-year-old G2P2 female at 40 weeks gestation presents to the hospital following a rush of water that came from her vagina. She is 4 cm dilated and 80% effaced. Fetal heart tracing shows a pulse of 155/min with variable decelerations. About 12 hours after presentation, she gives birth to a 6 lb 15 oz baby boy with APGAR scores of 8 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. Which of the following structures is responsible for inhibition of female internal genitalia?
Options:
A. Spermatogonia
B. Allantois
C. Syncytiotrophoblast
D. Sertoli cells

== Answer ==
{"answer_choice": "D"}

== Feedback ==
Incorrect answer: The answer should be "D" as Sertoli cells produce anti-Müllerian hormone, which inhibits the development of female internal genitalia; the prompt should clarify the context of embryonic development to avoid confusion.
