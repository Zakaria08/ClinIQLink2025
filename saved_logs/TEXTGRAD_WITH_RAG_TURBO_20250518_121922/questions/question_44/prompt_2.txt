Document 1 (Title: Telomerase reverse transcriptase): such as isoprenoids, genistein, curcumin, etc. These chemicals play a role in inhibiting the mTOR pathway via down-regulation of phosphorylation. The mTOR pathway is very important in regulating protein synthesis and it interacts with telomerase to increase its expression. Several other chemicals have been found to inhibit telomerase activity and are currently being tested as potential clinical treatment options such as nucleoside analogues, retinoic acid derivatives, quinolone antibiotics, and catechin derivatives. There are also other molecular genetic-based methods of inhibiting telomerase, such as antisense therapy and RNA interference.
Document 2 (Title: Respiratory symptoms, lung function, and mortality in a screening center cohort.): Numerous studies have documented the effects of smoking and reduced pulmonary function on all-cause mortality. The effects of respiratory symptoms are less well studied. This paper examines the joint effects of respiratory symptoms, lung function, and smoking using 11-year mortality data on 698 subjects aged 25 years and older. Copies of death certificates were obtained for all 120 confirmed deaths, and cause of death was coded by a nosologist using the rules of the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision. Symptoms of cough/phlegm, wheeze, and dyspnea were significantly associated with all-cause mortality in separate univariate analyses. On a cause-specific basis, these associations appeared to hold for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, and vascular disease. Further analysis indicated that, for both smokers and nonsmokers, the presence of chronic cough and/or sputum production was related to mortality only in the presence of wheezing. In addition, among smokers, the presence of both cough/phlegm and wheeze. In addition, among smokers, the presence of both cough/phlegm and wheeze was significantly associated with mortality only among subjects with low initial lung function. Although the limited number of deaths and the nonrandom nature of the cohort limit the generalizability of our findings, it seems clear, based on these results and other published studies, that symptoms of cough, phlegm, and/or wheeze have important adverse health implications even in the absence of smoking and reduced lung function. More studies using common methodological approaches are needed.
Document 3 (Title: HIV and AIDS -- Treatment / Management): Nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), INSTIs, and protease inhibitors are used in treatment-naive patients. NRTIs inhibit viral replication by binding the viral reverse transcriptase and terminating DNA prolongation in HIV-1 and HIV-2 infections. NNRTIs block DNA prolongation by binding the viral reverse transcriptase at a separate site but are only active against HIV-1. INSTIs inhibit the transcribed viral DNA from integrating into the host genome. Protease inhibitors block the last step in the viral maturation process, rendering assembled viral particles immature and noninfectious. The most common drugs within each class in the initial treatment of HIV are listed below.[NIH. HIV Guidelines. 2023] [23]
