Document 1 (Title: Can short hospital admissions be avoided? A review of admissions of less than 24 hours' duration in a paediatric teaching hospital.): To review the records of children admitted to hospital for less than 24 hours to assess the appropriateness of the admission and subsequent discharge, and the suitability of these patients for admission to a short stay area rather than the hospital wards. Retrospective study consisting of a one in three sample of all children admitted to the hospital's general medical units over one year. All admissions were listed sequentially, and every third patient was included in the study. Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne; a tertiary paediatric hospital with a major primary care role. There were a total of 660 patients eligible for inclusion in the study; 220 were selected, and all records were reviewed. It was found that although 87.7% of admissions could be justified on medical grounds alone, the children quickly recovered with at least 65% being fit for discharge within 12 hours of admission. In spite of this the mean duration of admission was 17.0 hours. The majority of patients were suffering from easily diagnosed and treated disorders, with 78.9% falling into four diagnostic groups (asthma, ingestions, infections, and convulsions). Criteria for admission to a short stay observation area were satisfied in 65% of patients (at the time of the study no such area existed in the hospital). No patients were discharged inappropriately early. A significant number of children require brief hospitalisation for relatively minor illness, but unnecessary delays caused by administrative aspects of hospital admission and relatively infrequent inpatient review by medical staff often lengthen the period of admission. Significant cost savings are possible with the use of a short stay facility, and a large number of patients are suitable for this form of care.
Document 2 (Title: Video-Assisted Thoracoscopy -- Clinical Significance): Despite the initial higher cost associated with VATS procedures, the overall cost-effectiveness for the hospital system is enhanced due to shorter hospital stays and reduced rates of complications, making it an economically viable option. [20] Long-term survival outcomes are comparable between VATS and open procedures, with no statistically significant differences observed in overall 3-year survival rates among patients undergoing VATS lobectomy compared to open lobectomy. [21] Therefore, VATS has become the recommended standard of care for lobectomies, endorsed by a consensus of experts in thoracic surgery. [22] Additionally, VATS segmentectomy has demonstrated favorable outcomes, including fewer postoperative complications and shorter hospital stays, further supporting its preference over traditional thoracotomy. [23] VATS esophagectomy has also shown promising results regarding oncologic outcomes, safety, and effective surgical techniques, indicating its potential as a viable alternative to open esophagectomy. [24] [25] [26] [27] Overall, the clinical significance of VATS lies in its ability to provide safer, more efficient, and cost-effective surgical interventions for a wide range of thoracic conditions, ultimately improving patient outcomes and quality of care.
Document 3 (Title: Croydon University Hospital): The Acute Medical Unit was opened in 2012; it contains 42 beds and provides rapid assessment and treatment for patients admitted from GPs or A&E. Patients may be discharged from AMU after a short stay (normally under 48 hours) or admitted to a specialty ward. The unit is also home to an Acute Care of the Elderly unit, and a Rapid Assessment Medical Unit with 13 beds, where patients can be quickly assessed by acute medicine doctors and either admitted to the AMU or to a specialist ward. In 2018, the trust opened its new Emergency Department. The new department is 30% larger than the previous department, and cost over £21 million to build. Facilities in the department include:

Assess the impact and success of a short stay or 23-hour observation ward in both general and academic children's hospitals, focusing on patient outcomes, efficiency, and overall hospital workflow.
