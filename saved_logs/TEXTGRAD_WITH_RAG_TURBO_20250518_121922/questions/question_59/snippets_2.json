        "content": "This management science as applied to the surgical suite is gaining more attention because of increasing market pressures on hospitals from competitors (e.g., other surgical suites including office based surgery) and from payers seeking lower prices. The surgical suite is often considered a profitable hospital unit. As such, surgical suites also comprise an important fraction of hospital budget spending. Holding patient safety constant, the opportunity to increase financial gain through modifying the use of already existing resources is a prime target for managerial analysis. Incremental improvements in operating room utilization and operating room efficiency can have major impacts on hospital staff and finances. Some hospital administrators perceive efficiency in the operating room as throughput, completing the most surgical cases within budget. Later in this article we will provide examples of tools a manager may use to analyze efficiency.",

        "content": "Despite the initial higher cost associated with VATS procedures, the overall cost-effectiveness for the hospital system is enhanced due to shorter hospital stays and reduced rates of complications, making it an economically viable option. [20] Long-term survival outcomes are comparable between VATS and open procedures, with no statistically significant differences observed in overall 3-year survival rates among patients undergoing VATS lobectomy compared to open lobectomy. [21] Therefore, VATS has become the recommended standard of care for lobectomies, endorsed by a consensus of experts in thoracic surgery. [22] Additionally, VATS segmentectomy has demonstrated favorable outcomes, including fewer postoperative complications and shorter hospital stays, further supporting its preference over traditional thoracotomy. [23] VATS esophagectomy has also shown promising results regarding oncologic outcomes, safety, and effective surgical techniques, indicating its potential as a viable alternative to open esophagectomy. [24] [25] [26] [27] Overall, the clinical significance of VATS lies in its ability to provide safer, more efficient, and cost-effective surgical interventions for a wide range of thoracic conditions, ultimately improving patient outcomes and quality of care.",
