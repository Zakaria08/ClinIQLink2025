Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease itself has four main forms, the sporadic (sCJD), the hereditary/familial (fCJD), the iatrogenic (iCJD) and the variant form (vCJD). These conditions form a spectrum of diseases with overlapping signs and symptoms. TSEs in non-human mammals include scrapie in sheep, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in cattle \u2013 popularly known as \"mad cow disease\" \u2013 and chronic wasting disease (CWD) in deer and elk. The variant form of Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease in humans is caused by exposure to bovine spongiform encephalopathy prions.",
