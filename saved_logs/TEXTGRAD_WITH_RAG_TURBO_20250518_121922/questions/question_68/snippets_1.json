        "title": "Closed-circuit TV: an effective patient education tool.",
        "content": "Patient education is well accepted to be an integral component of professional nursing practice. Although most nurses value patient teaching, the reality of the nursing shortage demands that innovative strategies be utilized to plan, implement and evaluate in-hospital patient education programs. Advances in computer technology have made closed-circuit television (CCTV) an attractive option for hospitals to fulfil their patient education mandate. As a delivery system, CCTV can be of considerable value. But as is true of other instructional media used to supplement educational efforts, CCTV also provides many traps that can limit its effectiveness. The biggest danger is the misuse of the tool by attempting to replace rather than supplement human interaction during the education process. This paper provides practical suggestions for the creative use of CCTV as a teaching tool to enhance patient education efforts. Pitfalls inherent in planning and implementing a CCTV system will be discussed.",

        "content": "Another form of learner self-assessment is the SHARP method. [16] Initially created to debrief events in the operating room, in this model, participants describe what went well (or not) and why. The acronym \"SHARP\" stands for: Set learning objectives: Determine what learners want to obtain from participating in the case and what the educator's goals are Ask, \"How did it go?\": Ask students to self-identify areas of strength and weakness. Address concerns: Discuss with students where improvements are possible. Review specific teaching points: This can include basic science and pathophysiology to students' communication and teamwork. Plan: Have students identify what they will take away from the case and incorporate it into their practice. [16] Because the SHARP method includes opportunities for teaching and incorporation into clinical practice, it may be a valuable tool for in situ simulation debriefs.",
