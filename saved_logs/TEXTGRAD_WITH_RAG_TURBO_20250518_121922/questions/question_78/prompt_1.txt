Document 1 (Title: Histology_Ross): ADI POS E TI SS U E 266 Adipose tissue is widely distributed throughout the body and in varying amounts in different individuals. It is a specialized connective tissue consisting of fat-storing cells, adipocytes, and has a rich blood supply. Two types of adipose tissue are recognized. The more common and abundant is referred to as white adipose tissue. Its adipocytes are very large cells whose cytoplasm contains a single large vacuole in which the fat is stored in the form of triglycerides. When observed in a typical H&E section, white adi-pose tissue appears as a mesh-like structure (see orientation micrograph). The second type is brown adipose tissue. It consists of smaller cells. Their cytoplasm is characterized by numerous vesicles that occupy much of the cells’ volume. It also is very richly vascu-larized. Brown adipose tissue is found in human newborns where it assists in maintaining body temperature. ORIENTATION MICROGRAPH: Shown here is white adipose tissue from the
Document 2 (Title: Adipose tissue): An excess of visceral fat is known as central obesity, or "belly fat", in which the abdomen protrudes excessively. New developments such as the Body Volume Index (BVI) are specifically designed to measure abdominal volume and abdominal fat. Excess visceral fat is also linked to type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance, inflammatory diseases, and other obesity-related diseases. Likewise, the accumulation of neck fat (or cervical adipose tissue) has been shown to be associated with mortality. Several studies have suggested that visceral fat can be predicted from simple anthropometric measures, and predicts mortality more accurately than body mass index or waist circumference.
Document 3 (Title: Quantification of adipose tissue by MRI: relationship with anthropometric variables.): This study had two objectives: 1) to establish magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a tool for measuring total and regional adipose tissue (AT) distribution in humans and 2) to assess the relationship between selected anthropometric variables and MRI-measured AT. Twenty-seven healthy men varying in age [40.8 +/- 14.5 (SD) yr], body mass index (28.5 +/- 4.8), and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR, 0.96 +/- 0.07) participated in the study. Total AT volume was determined using a linear interpolation of AT areas obtained on consecutive slices (n = 41) taken from head to toe (10-mm thickness, 50-mm centers). The mean change for repeated measures of total AT volume was 2.9% (range 0.9-4.3%). Large interindividual differences were observed for total AT volume (6.9-59.3 liters), subcutaneous AT (6.3-49.8 liters), and visceral AT (0.5-8.5 liters). Visceral AT represented 18.3% of the total AT. The single best predictor of total adiposity was waist circumference (R2 = 0.92). For visceral AT volume, WHR was the strongest anthropometric correlate (r = 0.85, P less than 0.01). When controlled for age and adiposity, however, WHR explained only 12% of the variation in absolute visceral AT and less than 1% of the variation in visceral-to-subcutaneous ratio. Age was a better predictor of visceral-to-subcutaneous ratio than level of adiposity or WHR. The results of this study demonstrate that MRI offers a reliable measure of regional and total AT distribution in humans and, thus, is of value as a research tool.

How accurately does measuring visceral adipose tissue at a single cross-sectional level estimate the overall volume of visceral adipose tissue in the body?
