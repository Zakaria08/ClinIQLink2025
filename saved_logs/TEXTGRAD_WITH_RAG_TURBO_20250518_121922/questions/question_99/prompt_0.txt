Document 1 (Title: Gynecology_Novak): Breast Cancer Sexual dysfunction following breast cancer treatment is likely to persist more than 1 year after diagnosis of breast cancer (63). Chemotherapy appears to be responsible for most of the resulting sexual difficulties, including loss of desire, subjective arousal, vaginal dryness, and dyspareunia (64). A small study of women with past breast cancer and complex endocrine status resulting from ongoing antiestrogen therapy found that, whereas relationship factors predicted desire, history of chemotherapy predicted disorders of arousal lubrication, orgasm, and dyspareunia but there was no connection between sexual function and androgen levels including androgen metabolites (65). A model for predicting sexual interest, function, and satisfaction after breast cancer has evolved from two large independent groups of breast cancer survivors (64). The most important predictors of sexual health were absence of vaginal dryness, presence of emotional well-being, positive body image,
Document 2 (Title: Postmenopausal Syndrome -- Treatment / Management -- Sexual Dysfunction): Sexual dysfunction is multifactorial. Treating hot flashes, vaginal dryness, and mood changes have been found to improve sexual dysfunction. Some of the symptoms, especially post-surgical menopause, are attributed to a decreased level of androgen. Low-dose vaginal estrogen and DHEA can be used in dyspareunia. Several randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials suggest that testosterone therapy improves sexual function like desire and frequency in postmenopausal women. The potential benefit and harm and the limited data on long-term use need to be discussed. Also, all safer options like relationship intervention, sex therapy sessions, optimizing treatment of depression, and treatment of another postmenopausal problem should be done before the trial of testosterone therapy. Transdermal and oral preparations are preferred in women.
Document 3 (Title: Intercorrelations among general arousability, emerging and current sexual desire, and severity of sexual dysfunction in women.): Intercorrelations among general trait arousability, emerging sexual desire, current sexual desire, lack of sexual desire perceived as a problem, and sexual dysfunction were assessed in 65 women currently involved in marital or de facto heterosexual relationships. The Stimulus Screening Test was used to measure general arousability and the Assessment of Sexual Function and Dysfunction Questionnaire was used to measure emerging sexual desire, current sexual desire lack of sexual desire, and sexual dysfunction. Analysis showed that arousability was positively associated with current levels of sexual desire which was negatively associated with sexual dysfunction. There was a curvilinear relationship between arousability and sexual dysfunction, with women experiencing both high and low levels of arousability being more likely to score higher on measures of sexual dysfunction than those experiencing medium levels of arousal. The possible implications of these results are discussed.
