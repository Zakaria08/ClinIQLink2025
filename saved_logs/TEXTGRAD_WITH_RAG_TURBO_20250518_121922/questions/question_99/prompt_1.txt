Document 1 (Title: The impact of breast cancer on sexuality, body image, and intimate relationships.): For women, breast cancer remains a common and dreaded experience. It is normal for a diagnosis of breast cancer to evoke grief, anger, and intense fear. Most women, however, face this crisis and master it without developing major psychiatric disorders or severe sexual dysfunction. The options of breast conservation and reconstruction give women a new sense of control over their treatment and are quite successful in helping women feel comfortable with their bodies again. The effectiveness of breast conservation and reconstruction in preventing or ameliorating sexual problems after breast cancer diagnosis is less clear, however. Any impact these options have on sexuality is subtle and may relate more to a woman's feelings of being desirable than to how often she has sex, her lovemaking practices, or how much she enjoys sex. We need more information on how chemotherapy and hormonal therapy affect women's sex lives. As clinicians, we should pay more attention to our patients' complaints of vaginal pain, dryness, and overall loss of sexual desire during systemic treatment. Practical advice on lovemaking techniques and a clinician's open attitude towards discussing sexual issues can prevent a great deal of anxiety and sadness as women with breast cancer search for ways to keep their sex lives satisfying.
Document 2 (Title: Postmenopausal Syndrome -- Treatment / Management -- Sexual Dysfunction): Sexual dysfunction is multifactorial. Treating hot flashes, vaginal dryness, and mood changes have been found to improve sexual dysfunction. Some of the symptoms, especially post-surgical menopause, are attributed to a decreased level of androgen. Low-dose vaginal estrogen and DHEA can be used in dyspareunia. Several randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials suggest that testosterone therapy improves sexual function like desire and frequency in postmenopausal women. The potential benefit and harm and the limited data on long-term use need to be discussed. Also, all safer options like relationship intervention, sex therapy sessions, optimizing treatment of depression, and treatment of another postmenopausal problem should be done before the trial of testosterone therapy. Transdermal and oral preparations are preferred in women.
Document 3 (Title: Cell_Biology_Alberts): A. Which of the two models in Figure Q20–2 accounts more readily for the features of these highly rearranged chromosomes? Explain your reasoning. B. For whichever model you choose, suggest how such multiple rearrangements might arise. (The true mechanism is not known.) C. Do you suppose such rearrangements are likely to be causative events in the cancers in which they are found, or are they probably just passenger events that are unrelated to the cancer? If you think they could be driver events, suggest how such rearrangements might activate an oncogene or inactivate a tumor suppressor gene. 20–8 Virtually all cancer treatments are designed to kill cancer cells, usually by inducing apoptosis. However, one particular cancer—acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL)— has been successfully treated with all-trans-retinoic acid, which causes the promyelocytes to differentiate into neutrophils. How might a change in the state of differentiation of APL cancer cells help the patient?

Can you explain how androgen levels influence sexual desire in women, and discuss any factors that might affect this relationship?
