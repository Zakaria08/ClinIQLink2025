Document 1 (Title: Pathoma_Husain): 4. Rouleaux formation ofRBCs on blood smear-Increased serum protein decreases charge between RBCs (Fig. 6.20B). 5. Primary AL amyloidosis-Free light chains circulate in serum and deposit in tissues. 6. Proteinuria-Free light chain is excreted in the urine as Bence Jones protein; deposition in kidney tubules leads to risk for renal failure (myeloma kidney). II. MONOCLONAL GAMMOPATHY OF UNDETERMINED SIGNIFICANCE (MGUS) A. Increased serum protein with M spike on SPEP; other features of multiple myeloma are absent (e.g., no lytic bone lesions, hypercalcemia, AL amyloid, or Bence Jones proteinuria). B. Common in elderly (seen in 5% of 70-year-old individuals); 1 % of patients with MGUS develop multiple myeloma each year. III. WALDENSTROM MACROGLOBULINEMIA A. B-cell lymphoma with monoclonal IgM production B. Clinical features include
Document 2 (Title: Bence-Jones Protein -- Introduction): While this seminal observation led to the first description of multiple myeloma (MM), it did not hold up to scrutiny over time. Today BJP is known as the light chain of immunoglobulins without the accompanying heavy chain and can be accurately quantified by electrophoretic techniques, including immunofixation electrophoresis (IFE). The other crucial teaching point is that BJP is undetectable by dipsticks used to detect proteinuria since they detect albumin and not BJP. [4] In this brief review, we describe the evolution of BJP, its biochemistry, and its high clinical relevance.
Document 3 (Title: Multiple myeloma): Overall, some 2–4% of multiple myeloma cases eventually progress to plasma cell leukemia. Diagnosis Blood tests The globulin level may be normal in established disease. A doctor may request protein electrophoresis of the blood and urine, which might show the presence of a paraprotein (monoclonal protein, or M protein) band, with or without reduction of the other (normal) immunoglobulins (known as immune paresis). One type of paraprotein is the Bence Jones protein, which is a urinary paraprotein composed of free light chains. Quantitative measurements of the paraprotein are necessary to establish a diagnosis and to monitor the disease. The paraprotein is an abnormal immunoglobulin produced by the tumor clone.

Identify the accurate statements about Bence-Jones protein, focusing on its clinical importance and biochemical attributes.

Options:
1. It is a thermostable urinary protein
2. It allows excluding multiple myeloma of bones
3. It is a light chain of immunoglobulin
4. It is a protein whose level is increased during inflammatory states
5. It can be revealed by immuno-electrophoresis
