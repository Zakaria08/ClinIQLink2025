The natural history of renal failure depends on the etiology of the disease but ultimately involves early homeostatic mechanisms involving hyperfiltration of the nephrons. The kidney maintains GFR, despite the progressive destruction of nephrons because the remaining normal nephrons develop hyperfiltration and compensatory hypertrophy. As a result, the patient with mild renal impairment can show normal creatinine values, and the disease can go undetected for some time. [24]",

An abrupt \u2193 in renal function leading to the retention of creatinine and BUN. \u2193 urine output (oliguria, defined as < 500 cc/day) is not required for ARF. ARF is categorized as follows (see also Table 2.16-3): Prerenal: \u2193 renal perfusion. Intrinsic: Injury within the nephron unit. Postrenal: Urinary out\ufb02ow obstruction. Generally, both kidneys must be obstructed before one can see a significant \u2191 in BUN and creatinine. Alcoholics are the most common patient population with hypomagnesemia.",
