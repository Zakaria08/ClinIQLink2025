Document 1 (Title: Capreomycin): Capreomycin was discovered from Streptomyces capreolus in 1960. It was removed from the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines in 2019. Spectrum of susceptibility Capreomycin is most commonly used to treat Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections. Mycobacterium tuberculosis growth has been found to be inhibited at a concentration of 2.5 μg/mL. Side effects High incidence: hematuria, urine output or urinary frequency significantly increased or decreased, loss of appetite or extreme thirst (hypokalemia, renal toxicity). Less incidence: hearing loss, tinnitus, gait instability, dizziness, dyspnea, lethargy, extreme weakness (neuromuscular blockade, renal toxicity, hypokalemia), nausea or vomiting. Significant renal toxicity: blood creatinine increase, blood urea nitrogen increase, poor creatinine clearance, proteinuria (need routine blood monitoring of renal functions and urine analysis) during usage of this medication.
Document 2 (Title: First_Aid_Step2): Labs may show concurrent hypocalcemia and hypokalemia. ECG may reveal prolonged PR and QT intervals. IV and oral supplements. Hypokalemia and hypocalcemia will not correct without magnesium correction. See Figure 2.16-2 for a diagnostic algorithm of acid-base disorders. A net ↓ in either tubular H+ secretion or HCO3 reabsorption that leads to a non–anion gap metabolic acidosis. There are three main types of RTA; type IV (distal) is the most common form (see Table 2.16-2). An abrupt ↓ in renal function leading to the retention of creatinine and BUN. ↓ urine output (oliguria, defined as < 500 cc/day) is not required for ARF. ARF is categorized as follows (see also Table 2.16-3): Prerenal: ↓ renal perfusion. Intrinsic: Injury within the nephron unit. Postrenal: Urinary outﬂow obstruction. Generally, both kidneys must be obstructed before one can see a significant ↑ in BUN and creatinine. Alcoholics are the most common patient population with hypomagnesemia.
Document 3 (Title: Renal function during erythropoietin therapy for anemia in predialysis chronic renal failure patients.): Recombinant human erythropoietin (r-HuEPO) therapy for anemia in chronic renal failure patients could have unfavorable renal effects since reversal of anemia can raise blood pressure and accelerate experimental glomerular injury. Thus, the effects of r-HuEPO on renal and systemic hemodynamics and the progression of renal disease were studied in predialysis chronic renal failure patients. The clearances of inulin and p-aminohippurate, fractional excretions of albumin and immunoglobulin G, cardiac output, plasma renin activity and aldosterone concentration were assessed at baseline, after short-term r-HuEPO (n = 4) or placebo (n = 4) therapy, and after long-term r-HuEPO for all patients (n = 8). In addition, the slope of l/serum creatinine with time was determined before and during continued r-HuEPO therapy. In contrast to placebo therapy, hematocrit increased with r-HuEPO from 32 to 37% after 7.6 +/- 2.7 weeks (mean +/- SD). Antihypertensive drug therapy was increased in 2 patients in each group. Renal function, cardiac output, plasma renin activity and aldosterone did not change significantly in either group. After 18 +/- 9 weeks of therapy for all patients, hematocrit increased from 31 to 39%. Antihypertensive drug therapy was increased in 5 patients and decreased in 1. Renal function decreased while proteinuria tended to increase. Cardiac output, plasma renin activity and aldosterone did not change. During 37 +/- 22 weeks of r-HuEPO therapy, the slope of l/serum creatinine did not worsen in any patient.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
