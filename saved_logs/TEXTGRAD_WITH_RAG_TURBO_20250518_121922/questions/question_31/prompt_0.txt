Document 1 (Title: Neurology_Adams): Rather than relying on the patient’s report to distinguish between fatigability and weakness, it is more informative to observe the patient during the performance of certain common activities such as walking, climbing stairs, and arising from a sitting, kneeling, squatting, or reclining position or using the arms over the head. Difficulty in performing these tasks signifies weakness rather than fatigue. Sometimes, the weakness of a group of muscles becomes manifest only after a period of activity; for example, the feet and legs may “drag” only after the patient has walked a long distance. The physician, upon being told this by the patient, should attempt to conduct the examination under circumstances that duplicate the complaints. Of course, these impairments of muscle function may be caused by a neuropathic or central nervous system (CNS) disturbance rather than of a myopathic one, but usually these conditions can be separated by the basic methods indicated further on in this chapter
Document 2 (Title: [A case of motor and sensory neuropathy with elevated serum lactate and pyruvate which responded to large dose of coenzyme Q10 therapy].): A 16-year-old high school male student was admitted to our hospital with complaints of difficulty in walking and muscle atrophy of the lower legs. He noticed his gait disturbance when he was about 12 years old and his symptoms had gradually increased. On examination, he was unable to walk on his heels and on his toes. He had mild pes cavus and marked muscle wastes of the lower legs. The weakness was limited to the feet, lower legs, and hands. Mild sensory losses were demonstrated inside of the feet. Autonomic dysfunction was not present. The deep tendon reflexes were diminished. Nerves were not enlarged or excessively firm. On laboratory examinations, pyruvate and lactate were elevated in both serum and cerebrospinal fluid. The serum level of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) was low (0.57 micrograms/ml). Nerve conduction velocities were normal or just below normal except sural nerves and amplitudes of M waves were decreased. The sural nerve finding revealed marked reduction in number of large myelinated fibers and no onion bulb formation. The teased myelinated fiber analysis suggested ongoing axonal degeneration. Electron microscopy showed no mitochondrial abnormalities in muscle and nerve. The therapeutic trial of large dose of CoQ10 (120 mg/day) was dramatically effective to muscle weakness and atrophy at about third week after therapy. His gait disturbance disappeared after about 16 months. These findings may indicate an alteration of mitochondrial function in this case.
Document 3 (Title: Astrocyte): Metabolic support: They provide neurons with nutrients such as lactate. Glucose sensing: normally associated with neurons, the detection of interstitial glucose levels within the brain is also controlled by astrocytes. Astrocytes in vitro become activated by low glucose and are in vivo this activation increases gastric emptying to increase digestion. Blood–brain barrier: The astrocyte end-feet encircling endothelial cells were thought to aid in the maintenance of the blood–brain barrier, but recent research indicates that they do not play a substantial role; instead, it is the tight junctions and basal lamina of the cerebral endothelial cells that play the most substantial role in maintaining the barrier. However, it has recently been shown that astrocyte activity is linked to blood flow in the brain, and that this is what is actually being measured in fMRI.

A 38-year-old man comes to his physician reporting double vision and difficulty walking. Upon examination, he displays signs consistent with multiple sclerosis, such as muscle weakness and sensory disturbances. What is the underlying pathophysiology affecting the central nervous system in this patient?

Options:
A. Decreased α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase activity in astrocytes
B. Increased extracellular concentration of glutamate
C. Increased astrocyte lactate
D. Breakdown of the blood-brain barrier
