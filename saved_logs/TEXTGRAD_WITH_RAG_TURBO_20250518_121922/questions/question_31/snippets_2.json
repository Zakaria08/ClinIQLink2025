Glucose sensing: normally associated with neurons, the detection of interstitial glucose levels within the brain is also controlled by astrocytes. Astrocytes in vitro become activated by low glucose and are in vivo this activation increases gastric emptying to increase digestion. Blood\u2013brain barrier: The astrocyte end-feet encircling endothelial cells were thought to aid in the maintenance of the blood\u2013brain barrier, but recent research indicates that they do not play a substantial role; instead, it is the tight junctions and basal lamina of the cerebral endothelial cells that play the most substantial role in maintaining the barrier. However, it has recently been shown that astrocyte activity is linked to blood flow in the brain, and that this is what is actually being measured in fMRI.",

        "content": "The most plausible hypothesis relates hepatic coma to an abnormality of nitrogen metabolism, wherein ammonia, which is formed in the bowel by the action of urease-containing organisms on dietary protein, is carried to the liver in the portal circulation but fails to be converted into urea because of hepatocellular disease, portal\u2013 systemic shunting of blood, or both. As a result, excess NH3 reaches the systemic circulation, where it interferes with cerebral metabolism in a way that is not fully understood. The ammonia theory best explains the basic neuropathologic change. Because the brain is lacking in urea cycle enzymes, Norenberg has proposed that the hypertrophy of the astrocytic cytoplasm and proliferation of mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum, as well as the increase in the astroglial glutamic dehydrogenase activity, all reflect heightened metabolic activity of these systems within astrocytes associated with ammonia detoxification.

        "content": "The work described in this chapter has indicated that improved outcome from an experimental head injury model can be achieved by drugs which are non-diuretic derivatives of loop diuretics, namely indanyl and fluorenyl compounds which are derivatives of ethacrynic acid. These drugs were originally identified by us on the basis of their efficacy in inhibiting [K+]-stimulated, HCO3(-)-dependent swelling of brain cerebrocortical slices. Swelling of glial cells (astrocytes) has long been known to be associated with such slice swelling and astrocyte swelling is a major locus of cytotoxic or cellular brain edema. Qualitative and quantitative electron microscope studies have shown that L644,711, a particularly effective member of the fluorenyl class of drugs, inhibits astrocytic swelling associated with an experimental animal head injury model. We have suggested that astrocytic swelling in pathological states may be partly due to activation of Cl-/HCO3- and Na+/H+ exchange systems driven by increased astrocytic intracellular hydration of CO2, and recent work has indeed shown that the ability of the indanyl and fluorenyl drugs to inhibit brain slice swelling and protect against head injury correlates closely with their ability to inhibit Cl-/HCO3- exchange. All these data suggest that astrocytic swelling, which seems to precede neuronal degeneration and breakdown of the blood-brain barrier, is deleterious and that prevention of such swelling can lead to effective therapy. We have used primary astrocytic cultures to explore reasons why astrocytic swelling could be harmful. Exposing such astrocytes to hypotonic medium causes rapid swelling with a slower return to normal volume in the continued presence of hypotonic medium, a process known as regulatory volume decrease or RVD. Such RVD is associated with marked release of several amino acids, including L-glutamate. L644,711 and other Cl-/HCO3- transport inhibitors such as SITS and furosemide, but not the selective Na+ + K+ + 2Cl- co-transport inhibitor bumetanide, inhibit such swelling-induced release of L-glutamate. Thus, L644,711 and other drugs may be effective in promoting recovery from head injury and other pathological states in which astrocytic swelling occurs either by initially preventing the swelling or inhibiting the release of excitotoxic excitatory amino acids if swelling does occur, perhaps depending at what time the drug is given.",
