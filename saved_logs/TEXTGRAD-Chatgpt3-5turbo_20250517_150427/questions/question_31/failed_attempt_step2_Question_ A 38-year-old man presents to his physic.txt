== Original Prompt ==
Question: A 38-year-old man presents to his physician with double vision persisting for a week. When he enters the exam room, the physician notes that the patient has a broad-based gait. The man’s wife informs the doctor that he has been an alcoholic for the last 5 years and his consumption of alcohol has increased significantly over the past few months. She also reports that he has become indifferent to his family members over time and is frequently agitated. She also says that his memory has been affected significantly, and when asked about a particular detail, he often recollects it incorrectly, though he insists that his version is the true one. On physical examination, his vital signs are stable, but when the doctor asks him where he is, he seems to be confused. His neurological examination also shows nystagmus. Which of the following options describes the earliest change in the pathophysiology of the central nervous system in this man?
Options:
A. Decreased α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase activity in astrocytes
B. Increased extracellular concentration of glutamate
C. Increased astrocyte lactate
D. Breakdown of the blood-brain barrier

== Full Prompt ==
What are the underlying mechanisms affecting the central nervous system in this 38-year-old man who presents with double vision? Consider the specific pathophysiological processes involved.

Options:
A. Decreased α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase activity in astrocytes
B. Increased extracellular concentration of glutamate
C. Increased astrocyte lactate
D. Breakdown of the blood-brain barrier

== Answer ==
{"answer_choice": "B"}

== Feedback ==
Incorrect answer: The answer should be "D" as breakdown of the blood-brain barrier is a common mechanism affecting the CNS in cases of double vision; the prompt could specify symptoms or conditions linked to each option to guide the choice.

== Improved Full Prompt ==
Identify the specific pathophysiological mechanisms affecting the central nervous system that result in double vision. Discuss the contributing factors and processes.
