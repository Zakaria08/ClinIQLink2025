== Original Prompt ==
Question: Do nomograms designed to predict biochemical recurrence (BCR) do a better job of predicting more clinically relevant prostate cancer outcomes than BCR?
Options:
A. True
B. False

== Answer ==
{"answer": "True"}

== Feedback ==
Incorrect answer: The answer should be "False" because nomograms predicting BCR are not necessarily better at predicting more clinically relevant outcomes, and the prompt could be improved by providing more context or definitions for terms like "clinically relevant outcomes."

== Improved Full Prompt ==
Do nomograms accurately predict more clinically relevant prostate cancer outcomes compared to the prediction of biochemical recurrence (BCR)?
