== Original Prompt ==
Question: Do nomograms designed to predict biochemical recurrence (BCR) do a better job of predicting more clinically relevant prostate cancer outcomes than BCR?
Options:
A. True
B. False

== Full Prompt ==
How do nomograms compare to biochemical recurrence (BCR) predictions in forecasting clinically significant prostate cancer outcomes?

Options:
A. True
B. False

== Feedback ==
Incorrect answer: The prompt is unclear as it asks for a comparison but provides options that imply a true/false statement; it should be rephrased to ask a specific true/false question about the comparison.
