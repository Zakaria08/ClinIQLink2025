== Original Prompt ==
Question: Among the following statements, which one(s) is (are) correct? The catabolism of saturated fatty acids:
Options:
1. Occurs in the cytoplasm
2. Is accompanied by ATP biosynthesis
3. Requires NADP-dependent dehydrogenase
4. Requires substrates activated by coenzyme A
5. Gives rise to alpha-beta unsaturated metabolites of the trans form

Respond strictly in valid JSON format as shown below:
{"answer": ["1", "3"]} ← if options 1 and 3 are correct
Only output the JSON object. Do not include explanations, labels, markdown, or any other text.

== Full Prompt ==
Among the following statements, identify any that accurately describe the catabolism process of saturated fatty acids.

Options:
1. Occurs in the cytoplasm
2. Is accompanied by ATP biosynthesis
3. Requires NADP-dependent dehydrogenase
4. Requires substrates activated by coenzyme A
5. Gives rise to alpha-beta unsaturated metabolites of the trans form

== Answer ==
{"answer": ["1", "3", "4"]}

== Feedback ==
Incorrect answer: The answer incorrectly includes option "2" which is not directly related to the catabolism of saturated fatty acids; the prompt should specify that only direct processes should be considered.

== Improved Full Prompt ==
Identify the statements among the following options that correctly explain the catabolic process of saturated fatty acids.
