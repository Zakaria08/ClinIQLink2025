== Original Prompt ==
Question: Among the following statements, which one(s) is (are) correct? The catabolism of saturated fatty acids:
Options:
1. Occurs in the cytoplasm
2. Is accompanied by ATP biosynthesis
3. Requires NADP-dependent dehydrogenase
4. Requires substrates activated by coenzyme A
5. Gives rise to alpha-beta unsaturated metabolites of the trans form

Respond strictly in valid JSON format as shown below:
{"answer": ["1", "3"]} ← if options 1 and 3 are correct
Only output the JSON object. Do not include explanations, labels, markdown, or any other text.

== Answer ==
```json
{"answer": ["2", "4"]}
```

== Feedback ==
Incorrect answer: The answer incorrectly includes option "2" which is not directly related to catabolism, and the prompt could be improved by specifying that only options directly related to the catabolic process should be considered.

== Improved Full Prompt ==
Among the following statements, identify any that accurately describe the catabolism process of saturated fatty acids.

Options:
1. Occurs in the cytoplasm
