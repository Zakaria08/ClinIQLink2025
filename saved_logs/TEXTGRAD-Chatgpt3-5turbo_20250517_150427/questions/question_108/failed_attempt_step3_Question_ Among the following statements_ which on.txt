== Original Prompt ==
Question: Among the following statements, which one(s) is (are) correct? Reversed-phase polarity chromatography:
Options:
1. Uses a polar stationary phase
2. Uses a hydro-organic mobile phase
3. Can be applied to ionized species
4. Elutes the most polar solutes first
5. Uses an unmodified silica stationary phase

Respond strictly in valid JSON format as shown below:
{"answer": ["1", "3"]} ← if options 1 and 3 are correct
Only output the JSON object. Do not include explanations, labels, markdown, or any other text.

== Full Prompt ==
Select the statement that accurately describes the concept of reversed-phase polarity chromatography.

Options:
1. Uses a polar stationary phase
2. Uses a hydro-organic mobile phase
3. Can be applied to ionized species
4. Elutes the most polar solutes first
5. Uses an unmodified silica stationary phase

== Answer ==
{"answer": ["2", "3"]}

== Feedback ==
Incorrect answer: The answer should be {"answer": ["2", "4"]} because reversed-phase chromatography uses a non-polar stationary phase and elutes the most polar solutes first; the prompt could specify that only one or two options are correct to guide the selection.

== Improved Full Prompt ==
Please choose the statement that best explains the principle and concept of reversed-phase polarity chromatography.
