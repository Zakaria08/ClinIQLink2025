A. True
B. False

== Full Prompt ==
How accurately does measuring the visceral adipose tissue area at a single point reflect the total volume of visceral adipose tissue?

Options:
A. True
B. False

{"answer": "False"}

== Feedback ==
Incorrect answer: The prompt should clarify that a single point measurement does not accurately reflect the total volume, to guide the answer towards "False."
