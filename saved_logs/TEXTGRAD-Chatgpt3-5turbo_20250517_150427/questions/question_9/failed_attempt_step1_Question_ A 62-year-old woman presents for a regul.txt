== Original Prompt ==
Question: A 62-year-old woman presents for a regular check-up. She complains of lightheadedness and palpitations which occur episodically. Past medical history is significant for a myocardial infarction 6 months ago and NYHA class II chronic heart failure. She also was diagnosed with grade I arterial hypertension 4 years ago.

Cardiopulmonary examination is significant for irregular heart rhythm and decreased S1 intensity. ECG is obtained and is shown in the picture (see image). Echocardiography shows a left ventricular ejection fraction of 39%. Which of the following drugs is the best choice for rate control in this patient?
Options:
A. Atenolol
B. Diltiazem
C. Propafenone
D. Digoxin
