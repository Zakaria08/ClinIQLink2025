The patient is currently drooling and his diaper is dry. The parents state he has not had a bowel movement in over 1 day. Which of the following is the pathophysiology of this patient’s condition?
Options:
A. Autoantibodies against the presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels
B. Autoimmune demyelination of peripheral nerves
