== Original Prompt ==
Question: An investigator is studying the function of the lateral nucleus of the hypothalamus in an experimental animal. Using a viral vector, the genes encoding chloride-conducting channelrhodopsins are injected into this nucleus. Photostimulation of the channels causes complete inhibition of action potential generation. Persistent photostimulation is most likely to result in which of the following abnormalities in these animals?
Options:
A. Hypothermia
B. Hyperthermia
C. Polydipsia
D. Anorexia

== Feedback ==
Incorrect answer: The answer should be "D" for anorexia, and the prompt should clarify the role of the lateral hypothalamus in feeding behavior to guide the correct choice.

== Improved Full Prompt ==
An investigator is examining the function of the lateral hypothalamus in animals. What abnormalities might arise in these animals if the lateral hypothalamus is damaged or dysfunctional?

Options:
A. Hypothermia
B. Hyperthermia
C. Polydipsia
D. Anorexia
