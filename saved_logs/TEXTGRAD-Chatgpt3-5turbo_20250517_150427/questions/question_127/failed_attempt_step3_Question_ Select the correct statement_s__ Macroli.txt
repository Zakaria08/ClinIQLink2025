== Answer ==
{"answer": ["2", "5"]}

== Feedback ==
Incorrect answer: The answer incorrectly includes option "2" and omits option "5"; the prompt should specify that macrolides do not act on DNA replication and are not always active against enterococci to guide correct option selection.

== Improved Full Prompt ==
