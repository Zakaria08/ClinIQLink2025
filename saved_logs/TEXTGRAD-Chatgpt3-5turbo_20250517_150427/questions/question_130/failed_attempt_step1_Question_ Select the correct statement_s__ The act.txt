== Original Prompt ==
Question: Select the correct statement(s): The activation energy of an enzymatic reaction is:
Options:
1. The energy needed to activate the enzyme concerned
2. The energy needed to activate the substrate
3. The energy released during the reaction
4. The energy retained in the reaction products
5. The energy provided by the reaction products

== Answer ==
{"answer": ["1"]}
```json
{"answer": ["1", "3"]}
```

== Feedback ==
Incorrect answer: The answer incorrectly includes option "3", and the prompt could be improved by clarifying that activation energy is not energy released during the reaction.

== Improved Full Prompt ==
Please identify the accurate statement(s) regarding the activation energy of an enzymatic reaction:
