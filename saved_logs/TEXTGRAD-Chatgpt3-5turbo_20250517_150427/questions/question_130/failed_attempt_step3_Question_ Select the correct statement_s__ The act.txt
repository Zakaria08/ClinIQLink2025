== Original Prompt ==
Question: Select the correct statement(s): The activation energy of an enzymatic reaction is:
Options:
1. The energy needed to activate the enzyme concerned
2. The energy needed to activate the substrate
3. The energy released during the reaction
4. The energy retained in the reaction products
5. The energy provided by the reaction products

Respond strictly in valid JSON format as shown below:
{"answer": ["1", "3"]} ← if options 1 and 3 are correct

== Answer ==
{"answer": ["1", "2"]}

== Feedback ==
Incorrect answer: The answer should include option "2" as well, and the prompt could be improved by clarifying that activation energy specifically refers to the energy required to initiate the reaction by activating the substrate.

== Improved Full Prompt ==
Identify the accurate statements regarding the activation energy in enzymatic reactions, considering how enzymes affect the energy required for the reaction to proceed.
