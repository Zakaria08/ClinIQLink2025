== Original Prompt ==
Question: Select the correct statement(s) that apply to the diffusion of an electrically neutral solute in a solvent:
Options:
1. The diffusion coefficient is expressed in m²·s⁻¹
2. The diffusion flux has the same direction as the concentration gradient
3. Diffusion decreases when temperature decreases
4. Diffusion increases when the viscosity of the solvent increases
5. Diffusion decreases when the molar mass of the solute decreases

Respond strictly in valid JSON format as shown below:

== Answer ==
{"answer": ["1", "2", "4"]}

== Feedback ==
Incorrect answer: The answer incorrectly includes option "5" and omits option "2"; the prompt should clarify the relationship between diffusion flux and concentration gradient to avoid confusion.
