Document 1 (Title: [Cerebral ischemia or post traumatic thrombosis of the A. carotis occuring to a car driver (author's transl)].): A short while after leaving a public-house a 71 year old man as the driver of his car was involved in a head-on collision with another car. On admission to a hospital he was unconscious with a distinct debility for the left side of his body and showed a changing anisocoria. Angiography of the right carotid artery revealed an occlusion. It was suspected that this was the terminal state of a generalized arteriosclerotic occlusion which was considered being the reason for the accident. The autopsy-findings showed, however, a posttraumatic thrombosis (whiplash-trauma of the cervical vertebral column) of the right arteria carotis and of the right arteria vertebralis with thromboembolia in a small pontine artery with an infarct-like ischemic softening. The differentiation from an apoplexia is of importance for the differential diagnosis.
Document 2 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): extension and positive surgical margins should be noted by the pathologist and correlated anatomically so that the surgeon and radiation oncologist can ensure appropriate radiation treatment.Thymic Carcinoma. Thymic carcinomas are unequivocally malignant at the microscopic level. Suster and Rosai classified thymic carcinomas into low-grade and high-grade tumors.160 Low-grade tumors are well differentiated with squamous cell, mucoepidermoid, or basaloid features. High-grade thymic car-cinomas include those with lymphoepithelial, small cell neu-roendocrine, sarcomatoid, clear cell, and undifferentiated or anaplastic features. Care must be taken to differentiate thymic carcinoma from lung cancer metastatic to the thymus gland as the histologic features can be similar between the two. Com-pared with thymomas, they are a more heterogeneous group of malignancies with a propensity for early local invasion and widespread metastases. Malignant pleural and pericardial effu-sions occur
Document 3 (Title: Ball differential): A ball differential is a type of differential typically used on radio-controlled cars. It differs from a geared differential by using several small ball bearings rotating between two plates, instead of bevel gears. History The first ball differential for Radio-controlled Cars was designed by Cecil Schumacher, a British motor sport engineer working at Cosworth and founder/owner of his eponymous model brand. Although a patent was applied for, it was denied as the idea had already been implemented into a lawn mower. Radio-controlled cars were still a new application for the ball differential and Schumacher is generally considered the modern day inventor of the concept. Such was the popularity of the ball differential, originally applied in 1/12 on-road cars, that he formed his eponymous company.
Document 4 (Title: Bronchoalveolar Cancer (Archived) -- Etiology): The earliest description of adenocarcinoma lung with peripheral pneumonic invasion can be traced to as early as 1876 by Malassez describing a multinodular pulmonary tumor as "cancer encephaloid du poumon'. Subsequently, in 1903, Muser described a similar diffuse growth pattern in a pulmonary tumor. History waited another 57 years before Dr. Averill Liebow coined the term BAC in 1960. He used it to describe a well-differentiated form of adenocarcinoma, which exhibits any of the three growth patterns: single nodular, multinodular, or diffuse pneumonic pattern. [4] [5] [6]
Document 5 (Title: Cancer-Associated Retinopathy -- Differential Diagnosis): It is important to differentiate CAR from a number of other conditions.
