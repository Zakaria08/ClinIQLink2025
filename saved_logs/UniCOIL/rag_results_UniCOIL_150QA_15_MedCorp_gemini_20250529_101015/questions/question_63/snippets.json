At the time, Maron was physician for the Seattle SuperSonics sports team, and sought to provide luxury primary care services similar to what he had been providing these athletes. MD²'s model included physician patient loads of 50 families, dramatically reduced compared with the conventional American patient load of about 3,000 patients per year. Advantages include very quick access to your personal physician as needed, and the ability to see doctors in any of 10 major cities at a greatly increased cost. MD² clients have insurance to cover additional services beyond primary care, but MD²'s fees cover the full costs of their services and MD² does not bill insurance.",

The Ambulatory Sentinel Practice Network (ASPN) conducted a 6-month study of primary care patients of all ages presenting after a fall, or with medical problems resulting from a fall. ASPN clinicians collected information about the history, physical examination findings, and follow-up of these patients. Causes of falls were grouped into three categories: external reasons for falling, internal reasons related to gait, and internal reasons unrelated to gait. Participating clinicians identified 431 patients who had falls out of the 256,680 seen for any reason during the study period. The patients ranged in age from 1 to 94 years. The rate of falls for patients increased rapidly after age 65 years. Most falls occurred for reasons external to the patient, but internal reasons, both nonlocomotor and locomotor, increased after age 65 years. No nonlocomotor causes for a fall were found in patients younger than 65 years of age. Also, the rate of hospitalization of patients seen for falls was greater in the geriatric age group.
