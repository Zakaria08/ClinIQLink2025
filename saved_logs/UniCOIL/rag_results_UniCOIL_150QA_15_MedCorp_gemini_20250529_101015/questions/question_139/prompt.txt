Document 1 (Title: Influence of scheduling, dose, and volume of administration of a perfluorochemical emulsion on tumor response to radiation therapy.): Studies were carried out with a new, concentrated perfluorochemical emulsion (PFCE) of the perfluorochemical F44E (48% V/V). When given at 4, 1.6, or 1 g/kg in undiluted injection volumes iv 1 hr prior to a range of single doses of radiation with inspired carbogen dose modifying factors (DMF's) based on tumor growth delay (TGD) in the Lewis lung tumor of 2.5, 1.7, and 1.5, respectively, were produced. When the PFC dose was administered in a volume of 0.2 ml, the dose modifying factors produced by 4 g/kg (0.1 ml undiluted) did not change significantly (2.6), but the dose modifying factors produced by 1.6 g/kg (0.04 ml undiluted) and by 1.0 g/kg (0.025 ml undiluted) increased significantly to 2.0 and 1.8 (p less than 0.05), respectively. Using the tumor excision assay at 24 hr post treatment in the FSaIIC fibrosarcoma, administration of 6, 4, or 2 g/kg in 0.2 ml injections plus carbogen breathing 1 hr prior to and during treatment resulted in dose modifying factors of 1.5, 1.6, and 1.3, respectively.

Document 2 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Unburned cured tobacco used orally contains nicotine, carcinogens, and other toxicants capable of causing gum disease, oral and pancreatic cancers, and an increase in the risk of heart disease. When tobacco is burned, the resultant smoke contains, in addition to nicotine, more than 7000 other compounds that result from volatilization, pyrolysis, and pyrosynthesis of tobacco and various chemical additives used in making different tobacco products. The smoke is composed of a fine aerosol and a vapor phase; aerosolized particles are of a size range that results in deposition in the airways and alveolar surfaces of the lungs.

Document 4 (Title: The stereoselectivity of the 'single drug binding site' of human alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (orosomucoid).): The stereoselective binding of six pairs of basic, one pair of acidic drug enantiomers, and one pair of diastereomers for human alpha 1-acid glycoprotein was investigated by means of competition experiments against [3H]propranolol- or [14C]nicardipine-labelled binding sites using equilibrium dialysis to separate free from bound marker ligand. The affinity constants (Ka) for association of [3H]propranolol and [14C]nicardipine with alpha 1-AGP were 1.2 +/- 0.6 X 10(5) M-1 and 3.4 +/- 1.4 X 10(5) M-1, respectively, and control binding amounted to 57 +/- 7 and 91 +/- 2%, respectively. The following selectivity factors, calculated as the ratio of the higher over the lower enantiomer concentrations displacing 15% of control radiomarker binding (IC15-value), were obtained against propranolol and nicardipine: (-)/(+) propranolol: 1.9 and 1.7.; (+)-/(-)-disopyramide: 2.8 and 1.4; (+)-/(-)-verapamil: 1.6 and 1.9; (+)-(S)-/(-)-(R)-202-791, a dihydropyridine derivative: 2.6 and 2.0; (-)-/(+)-asocainol: 1.7 and 3.0; (+)-/...
