        "content": "The incidence of cancer was studied in a population-based cohort of 9,353 individuals (8,340 men and 1,013 women) with a discharge diagnosis of alcoholism in 1965-83, followed up for 19 years (mean 7.7). After exclusion of cancers in the first year of follow-up, 491 cancers were observed cf 343.2 expected through 1984 (standardized incidence ratio [SIR] = 1.4, 95 percent confidence interval [CI] = 1.3-1.6). A similar excess risk of cancer was seen among men (SIR = 1.4, CI = 1.3-1.6) and among women (SIR = 1.5, CI = 1.1-2.0). We observed the established associations with cancers of the oral cavity and pharynx (SIR = 4.1, CI = 2.9-5.7), esophagus (SIR = 6.8, CI = 4.5-9.9), larynx (SIR = 3.3, CI = 1.7-6.0), and lung (SIR = 2.1, CI = 1.7-2.6), although confounding by smoking likely increased these risk estimates. While there was evidence of increased risk for pancreatic cancer (SIR = 1.5, CI = 0.9-2.3), alcoholism did not elevate the incidence of cancer of the stomach (SIR = 0.9, CI = 6-1.4), large bowel (SIR = 1.1, CI = 0.8-1.5), prostate (SIR = 1.0, CI = 0.8-1.3), urinary bladder (SIR = 1.0, CI = 0.6-1.5), or of malignant melanoma (SIR = 0.9, CI = 0.3-1.9). Among women, the number of breast cancers observed was close to expected (SIR = 1.2, CI = 0.6-2.2), although a significant excess number of cervical cancers occurred (SIR = 4.2, CI = 1.5-9.1).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "content": "In order to explore the genetic risk of a child with a family history of allergies developing asthma, allergic rhinitis, or atopic dermatitis, questionnaires filled in by 6665 families were analysed. The data were collected in a population based cross sectional survey of 9-11 year old schoolchildren living in Munich and southern Bavaria. The relation between asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis and the number of allergic first degree relatives, and the type of allergic disease was examined. Analyses were done separately for families with single or multiple allergic diseases. In families with one allergic parent the risk of the child developing asthma was increased by asthma in a parent, with an odds ratio (OR) of 2.6 (95% confidence interval 1.7 to 4.0) but not by parental allergic rhinitis with OR 1.0 (0.7 to 1.5) or atopic dermatitis, OR 1.0 (0.6 to 1.6). For allergic rhinitis the highest risk with OR 3.6 (2.9 to 4.6) was observed with allergic rhinitis of one parent, apparently lower for asthma of one parent, OR 2.5 (1.6 to 4.0) or atopic dermatitis, OR 1.7 (1.1 to 2.5). Children with parental atopic dermatitis had a high risk for atopic dermatitis, OR 3.4 (2.6 to 4.4), compared with children with parental asthma, OR 1.5 (1.0 to 2.2), or parental allergic rhinitis, OR 1.4 (1.1 to 1.8). Risk factors in families with combined allergies of two relatives (parents and siblings) were analysed separately for the different combinations. These results support the hypothesis that asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis are multifactorial diseases brought about by various familial and environmental influences.",

        "title": "Expression of the alpha-fetoprotein gene in adult rat liver.",
        "content": "The adult rat liver contains three alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) mRNAs of 2.2 (minor), 1.7, and 1.5 kb. These transcripts share a common 3' sequence, but the 1.7- and 1.5-kb AFP mRNAs lack sequences present in the first seven 5' exons of the 2.2-kb AFP mRNA. S1 nuclease analysis maps the 1.7-kb mRNA at the 5' boundary of the eighth exon of the 2.2-kb AFP mRNA and the 1.5-kb mRNA in the middle of the eight exon. In a transformed fetal rat liver cell line, we have previously identified a 1.7-kb AFP mRNA which is encoded by an AFP cDNA (ARFP5) isolated from an adult rat liver cDNA library. The 90-bp 5' sequence of ARFP5, which is located in the seventh intron of the rat AFP gene, is not present in the 2.2-kb fetal AFP mRNA, although ARFP5 does contain nucleotide sequence present in the 2.2-kb AFP mRNA extending from the beginning of its eighth exon (nucleotide 873) to the 3' end. The 1.7-kb RNA in adult liver also hybridizes with the 90-bp 5' sequence of ARFP5, suggesting that the two 1.7-kb AFP mRNAs are similar. The developmental profile of these AFP transcripts shows that fetal rat liver contains mainly the 2.2-kb mRNA which decreases to a very low level around the fifth week after birth. The 1.7- and 1.5-kb AFP mRNAs can be visualized about the third and fourth weeks after birth, respectively, and are the major AFP mRNAs in the liver of rats that are older than 4 weeks. The levels of the AFP mRNAs in adult liver are approximately 0.4% of the AFP mRNA level in 18-day-old fetal liver. Both the 1.7- and 1.5-kb AFP mRNAs are actively translated; they direct the cell-free synthesis of two polypeptides of 50K and 44K. A 50K polypeptide is also the encoded product of the 1.7-kb mRNA in the transformed fetal rat liver cell line, suggesting that the 44K polypeptide may be encoded by the 1.5-kb AFP mRNA.",
