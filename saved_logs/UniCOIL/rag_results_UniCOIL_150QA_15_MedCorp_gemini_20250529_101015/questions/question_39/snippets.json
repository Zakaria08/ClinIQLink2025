        "content": "The enzyme 3-methylaspartate ammonia-lyase (EC 4.3.1.2) catalyzes the exchange of the C-3 hydrogen of the substrate, (2S,3S)-3-methylaspartic acid, with solvent hydrogen. The mechanism of the exchange reaction was probed using (2S,3S)-3-methylaspartic acid and its C-3-deuteriated isotopomer. Incubations conducted in tritiated water allowed the rate of protium or deuterium wash-out from the substrates to be measured as tritium wash-in. The primary deuterium isotope effects for the exchange under essentially Vmax conditions ( [S] much greater than Km) were 1.6, 1.5, and 1.5 at pH 9.0, 7.6, and 6.5. The deamination reaction, measured spectrophotometrically on the same incubations, showed isotope effects of 1.7, 1.6, and 1.4 at pH 9.0, 7.6, and 6.5, in agreement with the values of DV and D(V/K) reported previously [Botting, N.P., Akhtar, M., Cohen, M.A., &amp; Gani, D. (1988) Biochemistry 27, 2956-2959]. The ratio of the rate of exchange to the rate of deamination, however, varied widely with pH. Together with the identical values of the primary isotope effects for the two reactions, this result indicates that the partition between reaction pathways occurs after the slowest steps in the common part of the reaction coordinate pathway, almost certainly after the cleavage of the C-N bond at the level of the enzyme-ammonia-mesaconic acid complex, and not at the putative carbanion level as was previously suggested. The enzyme requires both K+ and Mg2+ ions for activity, although ammonium ion is also able to bind in the K+ site and act as an activator. Variation of the metal ion concentration alters the magnitude of the primary deuterium isotope effects. The variation of potassium ion concentration causes the most marked changes: at 1.6 mM K+, DV and D(V/K) are 1.7, whereas at 50 mM K+, DV and D(V/K) are reduced to 1.0. The isotope effects are also reduced at low K+ concentration due to the emergence of a slow-acting high K+ affinity monopotassium form of the enzyme. The binding order and role of the metal ion cofactors and their influence in determining the formal mechanism of the reaction is discussed, and the failure of previous workers to observe primary deuterium isotope effects for the deamination process is explained. The product desorption order was tested by product inhibition, alternative product inhibition, and isotope exchange experiments. Ammonia and mesaconic acid debind in a random fashion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

        "content": "We have determined the binding of sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) to the human red cell glucose transporter (polypeptide, Mr 54,117) and to a water-soluble enzyme, N-5'-phosphoribosylanthranilate isomerase-indole-3-glycerol-phosphate synthase (PRAI-IGPS) from Escherichia coli (Mr 49,484). [35S]SDS was equilibrated with each protein on molecular-sieve chromatography at a series of SDS concentrations. The binding ratios of SDS to protein were determined by flow scintillation detection and automated amino acid analyses. Unexpectedly the glucose transporter, which is a transmembrane protein, bound about the same amount of SDS per gram of protein as did the enzyme. At 1.6 mM SDS, slightly below the critical micelle concentration (CMC) (1.8 mM) in the eluent, the binding ratio was 1.6 g SDS/g protein for both the glucose transporter and PRAI-IGPS. At 2.0 mM SDS (above the CMC) the glucose transporter showed a binding ratio of 1.7 g SDS/g protein. The corresponding value for the enzyme was about 1.5 g/g. The SDS-glucose transporter complex seems to be more compact than the SDS-enzyme complex as judged by molecular-sieve chromatography and by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Recent neutron scattering results have shown a protein-decorated triple-micelle structure for the SDS-PRAI-IGPS complex. Hypothetically, the more compact SDS-glucose transporter complex may therefore consist of a dual-micelle structure. The molecular-sieve gel beads bound considerable amounts of SDS. The SDS binding to the gel matrix and to the proteins increased with increasing SDS concentration up to at least 1.6-2.0 mM SDS. In the case of the water-soluble enzyme a shoulder was observed in the binding curve at 1 mM SDS, probably reflecting a change in the conformation of the complex.",

Unexpectedly the glucose transporter, which is a transmembrane protein, bound about the same amount of SDS per gram of protein as did the enzyme. At 1.6 mM SDS, slightly below the critical micelle concentration (CMC) (1.8 mM) in the eluent, the binding ratio was 1.6 g SDS/g protein for both the glucose transporter and PRAI-IGPS. At 2.0 mM SDS (above the CMC) the glucose transporter showed a binding ratio of 1.7 g SDS/g protein. The corresponding value for the enzyme was about 1.5 g/g. The SDS-glucose transporter complex seems to be more compact than the SDS-enzyme complex as judged by molecular-sieve chromatography and by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Recent neutron scattering results have shown a protein-decorated triple-micelle structure for the SDS-PRAI-IGPS complex. Hypothetically, the more compact SDS-glucose transporter complex may therefore consist of a dual-micelle structure. The molecular-sieve gel beads bound considerable amounts of SDS. The SDS binding to the gel matrix and to the proteins increased with increasing SDS concentration up to at least 1.6-2.0 mM SDS. In the case of the water-soluble enzyme a shoulder was observed in the binding curve at 1 mM SDS, probably reflecting a change in the conformation of the complex.",

        "content": "Male Wistar rats were exposed to 0.2 ppm ozone (O3) for 14 days and at intervals alveolar macrophages were collected by bronchoalveolar lavage to examine the effects of O3. The specific activities of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and glutathione peroxidase of alveolar macrophages increased to 1.6-fold (on the 3rd day) and 1.5-fold (on the 5th day), respectively, those of the control values. Similarly, the specific activities of pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, and hexokinase also increased to 1.6-fold, 1.4-fold, and 1.2-fold, respectively, those of the control values on the 3rd day. The activities of all enzymes tested were maintained at significantly higher levels until the 14th day. Furthermore, the incorporation of [14C]thymidine into alveolar macrophages increased twice the control values on the 1st and 3rd days and was almost completely inhibited by the addition of 1.23 x 10(-4) M aphidicolin, a competitive inhibitor of DNA polymerase alpha. The number of alveolar macrophages collected from exposed animals also increased to 1.5-fold that of the control value on the 3rd day and was maintained at significantly higher level until the 14th day. It was noted that alveolar macrophages of small size preferentially increased between the 5th and 14th days. These results show that exposures to 0.2 ppm O3 induced a metabolic enhancement of the peroxidative metabolism, glycolysis, and DNA synthesis in alveolar macrophages and increased the macrophages of small size.",
