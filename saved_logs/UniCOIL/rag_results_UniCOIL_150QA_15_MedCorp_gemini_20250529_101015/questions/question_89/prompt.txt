Document 1 (Title: Tamoxifen treatment increases the concentration of 52K-cathepsin D and its precursor in breast cancer tissue.): The pro-cathepsin D of Mr 52,000 is regulated by estrogens via the estrogen receptor (RE) and is secreted by breast cancer cells in vitro. In an attempt to predict the hormone responsiveness of breast cancer in vivo, we have assayed total 52K cathepsin D and its precursor in the primary breast cancer cytosol of 36 patients treated before surgery with 30 mg of tamoxifen daily for 1 to 5 weeks (average, 3 weeks). Compared to a similar control population, total 52K cathepsin D was increased by tamoxifen (P = 0.02) but less so than its precursor (P less than 0.001). Furthermore, 45% of the RE-positive tumors from tamoxifen-treated patients had a higher cathepsin D precursor concentration than the same type of tumor from control patients, or than RE-negative tumors from tamoxifen-treated patients. This 3-week challenge test was probably too short to avoid partial estrogenic activity of tamoxifen (flare) and the authors infer that longer time of treatment would decrease rather than increase the concentration of cat...
Document 2 (Title: Oophorectomy -- Indications -- Risk-Reducing): A risk-reducing BSO (however, it could be unilateral) refers to removing both fallopian tubes and ovaries to reduce the risk of re-operation or cancer. Risks of re-operation compared to risks of menopause should be discussed in patients with a history of pelvic inflammatory disease, TOAs, endometriosis, pelvic adhesions, or primary dysmenorrhea. [1] Other candidates for risk-reducing BSO include those with hereditary syndromes (such as BRCA mutations) that carry a substantially increased lifetime risk of ovarian malignancy or hormone-sensitive breast cancers.
