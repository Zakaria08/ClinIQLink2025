        "content": "Self-recognition between pollen and stigma during pollination in Brassica oleracea is genetically controlled by the multiallelic self-incompatibility locus (S). We describe the S receptor kinase (SRK) gene, a previously uncharacterized gene that resides at the S locus. The nucleotide sequences of genomic DNA and of cDNAs corresponding to SRK predict a putative transmembrane receptor having serine/threonine-specific protein kinase activity. Its extracellular domain exhibits striking homology to the secreted product of the S-locus glycoprotein (SLG) gene and is connected via a single pass transmembrane domain to a protein kinase catalytic center. SRK alleles derived from different S-locus genotypes are highly polymorphic and have apparently evolved in unison with genetically linked alleles of SLG. SRK directs the synthesis of several alternative transcripts, which potentially encode different protein products, and these transcripts were detected exclusively in reproductive organs. The identification of SRK may provide new perspectives into the signal transduction mechanism underlying pollen recognition.",

By ultrastructural, biochemical and immunofluorescent investigations it has been shown that a cytoskeletal apparatus plays a central role in pollen tube growth. Microfilaments and microtubules, in which main components are, respectively, actin and tubulin, represent the most investigated cytoskeletal components. New information has been recently provided by the identification of myosin and also of a kinesin-like protein. The pollen tube cytoskeleton consists of two different cytoskeletal systems: the vegetative cell cytoskeleton, namely the cytoskeleton of the pollen grain and pollen tube, and the gamete cytoskeleton (generative cell and sperm cell cytoskeleton). The vegetative cell cytoskeleton plays a fundamental role in assuring the cytoplasmic movement of organelles, vesicles and gametes from the pollen grain to the pollen tube apex and consists mainly of microtubules and microfilaments. Also myosin and the kinesin-like protein are involved in the process of organelle and vesicle movement. The gamete cytoskeleton has a central role in sperm cell formation and in the reshaping process during gamete movement inside the pollen tube. It consists mostly of microtubules and partially characterized microtubule-associated structures. Actin filaments have recently also been identified.",

Integrating the biological perspective into a holistic paradigm and progressing toward a discipline in which the biological, psychological, and social interact coherently and interdependently requires a dual focus on understanding and treating patients and their social and physical environments.
