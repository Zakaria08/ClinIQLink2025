It is the purpose of this study to evaluate the relationship between roentgenographic feature of initial chest roentgenogram (less than 10 hours old) and outcome in infants with meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS). We analyzed retrospectively the clinical data and initial chest roentgenograms of 65 infants who had MAS and who were admitted to NICU of Mackay Memorial Hospital in 1987. The incidence and the mortality rate in this hospital were 0.33% and 15.4% respectively. Infiltration was seen in 52, consolidation or atelectasis in 18, hyperinflation in 17, air leak in 11, and cardiomegaly in 4. The outcome was similar between infants with the first four features. Four infants with cardiomegaly also had other types of roentgenographic feature and PH value of initial blood gas less than 7.0, which means that their poor outcome was influenced by multiple factors. From this observation we concluded that the initial chest roentgenogram is a useful aid for the diagnosis and treatment of MAS, but it is not suitable for predicting the outcome of infants with MAS.",

From March 1983 to May 1990, 17 children with ARDS were admitted and treated at the pediatric intensive care unit of the University Hospital of Graz. The ARDS score was evaluated as a predictor of outcome. The score is based on four variables: mean airway pressure, oxygenation index, additional number of organ system failure and a radiological score, each of which was assigned a score between 0 and 3 (Table 3). The score was recorded on admission or immediately after respiratory failure and after 24, 48 and 72 h. The patients were divided into survivors and non-survivors. After 24 h of mechanical ventilation the ARDS score was 7.16 +/- 0.79 in survivors and 10.4 +/- 0.4 points in non-survivors (P less than 0.0006). Similar differences were found after 48 and 72 h of therapy. In addition, the predictive power of the ARDS score after 24 h was tested at a level of 8 points. The sensitivity and the positive predictive value were 90%, while specificity and negative predictive value were 85.7%. The correct prediction was 88.2%. We conclude that this simple ARDS score can be an useful prognostic factor in patients with ARDS.",
