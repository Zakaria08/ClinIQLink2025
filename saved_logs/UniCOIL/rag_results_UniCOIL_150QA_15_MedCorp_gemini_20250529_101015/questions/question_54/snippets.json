        "content": "To determine the relationship between lower esophageal sphincter (LES) intraluminal pressure and its intraluminal pH, we studied six healthy volunteers. We recorded intraluminal pressure and pH concurrently using rapid pull-through, slow pull-through, and station pull-through, as well as, rapid push-through and slow push-through techniques. The results showed that LES length was 35 +/- 4 (SE) mm by RPT and 30 +/- 3 mm by SPT. The pressure was maximal in the proximal half of the LES. On rapid pull-throughs, the intraluminal pH rose from about 1.5 to reach a value of about 2.5 at the peak of the high pressure zone. With continued withdrawal into the esophageal body, the recorded pH rose minimally to about 3-4. On push-throughs, the pH recorded along the LES was the same as that of the esophageal body. After the electrode cleared the LES, the pH abruptly fell to gastric pH. During station pull-through with the electrode 0.5-1.5 cm proximal to the distal LES margin, transient pH drops were observed with swallows. With rapid swallows, however, the pH drop did not occur until after the last swallow. This finding suggests that the pH drops with swallows were due to axial LES movement rather than gastroesophageal acid reflux. We conclude that 1) the relationship of the gastroesophageal pH transition zone and LES high pressure zone is better defined by a sphincter push-through than a pull-through; 2) the transition between gastric and esophageal pH occurs either at or slightly distal to the distal LES margin; and 3) swallow-induced axial LES movement may cause spurious recording of acid reflux when the pH probe is positioned within the distal half of the LES.",

Six female nursing students with prior patient transfer experience served both as nurses and as passive patients. Static biomechanical evaluation showed that the mean trunk flexion moments, erector spinae muscle forces and compressive and shear forces at the L5S1 disc for the four pulling methods ranged from 92 to 125 Nm, 1845 to 2507 N, 1973 to 2641 N and 442 to 580 N, respectively, as compared to about 213 Nm, 4260 N, 5050 N and 926 N for two-person manual lifting. Perceived stress ratings for the shoulder, upper back, lower back and whole body were significantly lower for pulling methods than those for lifting the patient (p less than or equal to 0.01).

These patient handling tasks were studied using five manual techniques and three hoist-assisted techniques. The manual techniques involved one-person and two-person transfers. One manual technique involved a two-person lift of the patient under the arms; the others used a rocking and pulling action and included the use of assistive devices (a gait belt using a two-person transfer, a walking belt with handles using a one-person and a two-person transfer, and a patient handling sling with cutout areas to allow for a hand grip (Medesign) for a one-person transfer). The three mechanical hoists were Hoyer, Trans-Aid and Ambulift. Six female nursing students with prior patient transfer experience served both as nurses and as passive patients. Static biomechanical evaluation showed that pulling techniques, as compared to lifting the patient, required significantly lower hand forces and produced significantly lower erector spinae and compressive forces at the L5/S1 disc (P greater than or equal to 0.01). Shear force, trunk moments and the percentage of females who were capable of performing the transfers (based on static strength simulation) also favoured pulling methods.

The clutch cover is put on top of the bar and it is secured through these bolts. The number of bolts is determined by the size of the saw. Bar types Different bar types are available:",

This is basically the thickness of the drive links. 0.063 in or 1.6 mm 0.058 in or 1.5 mm 0.050 in or 1.3 mm 0.043 in or 1.1 mm Oil holes The end of the saw power head has two oil holes, one on each side. These holes must match with the outlet of the oil pump. The pump sends the oil through the hole in the lower part of the gauge.

Members of this enzyme family include long-chain, medium-chain, and short-chain acyl CoA dehydrogenases (LCAD), (MCAD), and (SCAD), respectively. These enzymes catalyze the formation of a trans double bond between the alpha and beta carbons on acyl CoA molecules by removing two electrons to produce one molecule of FAD(H2), which eventually accounts for 1.5 ATP molecules produced in the electron transport chain (ETC).",

Kanakuri had a rough 18-day-long trip to Stockholm, first by ship and then by train all through the Trans-Siberian Railway, and needed five days to recover for the race. The race was held in Sollentuna Municipality, in Sweden, in – for this time – unexpected 25 °C (77 °F) heat, and over half of the runners in the event had hyperthermia. Kanakuri, weakened by the long journey from Japan, and having problems with the first-experienced white nights and the local foods, and making the things worse, the Japanese team coach, Hyozo Omori, had been mostly bedridden due to tuberculosis during his stay in Stockholm, resulted in the insufficient amount of pre-game training given to 2 athletes including Kanakuri, pulled out midway through the race, and was cared for by a local family. Being embarrassed from his \"failure\" he silently returned to Japan without notifying race officials.",
