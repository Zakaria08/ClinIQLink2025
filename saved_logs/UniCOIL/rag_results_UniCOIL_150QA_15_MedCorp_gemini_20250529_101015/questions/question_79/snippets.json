        "content": "Past work in the isolated perfused cat lung has shown that acute hypoxia (H) changes the response to norepinephrine (NE) from vasoconstriction to vasodilation but has no effect on the response to serotonin (S). These results could be related to the increase in pulmonary arterial pressure or vascular resistance during the hypoxic pressor response or a direct effect of H. We addressed this question, in the same preparation, by comparing responses to NE under four conditions in each experimental animal (n = 12): 1) NE infused during normoxia; 2) NE infused after vascular resistance (Rpv) was increased with serotonin; 3) NE infused after Rpv was increased by H; 4) NE infused after lobar pressure was raised by an increase in flow (P/F). PO2 values during H were varied (27-56 Torr). S and H produced a 137 +/- 35 and 43 +/- 8% delta Rpv increase in lobar vascular resistance, respectively. P/F increased lobar pressure 91 +/- 10%. Only NE infusion during H demonstrated significant differences in lobar pressure and Rpv compared with control normoxic periods. There was no correlation between responses to NE during S, H, and P/F and degree to which each stimulus increased Rpv or lobar pressure (r = 0.003, 0.28, 0.24). A significant relationship between response to NE during H vs. PO2 during H was observed (r = 0.78; P less than 0.001). In a subset of animals, we repeated the infusion of NE during H and P/F post-beta-blockade. The decrease in vascular response to NE during H and the correlation of PO2 with NE response were abolished (n = 7).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

The critical parameters in the approximation are the coefficient of inbreeding due to nonrandom mating (F) and the effective population size (Ne), which also depends on F and the variance of family size.

For Poisson family size (independent Poisson distributions of selfed and nonselfed offspring with partial selfing, and independent Poisson distributions of male and female numbers with partial sib mating), Ne = N/(1 + F), and the time until fixation is approximately equal to Ne/N times the time to fixation with random mating, but this relation does not hold, however, for other distributions of family size. The cumulative nonadditive variance until fixation or loss for dominant genes is reduced with increasing F while for recessive genes it is increased with intermediate values of F.
