Replacement of the P-NH group by P-CH2 (1----3 and 4----6) weakens the overall binding free energy by about 1.5 kcal/mol. A negligible difference in solvation energy has been measured for these pairs, and the basicity of the P-O- ligand for zinc in each pair remains nearly unchanged as determined by pH titration of their 31P NMR resonances.

In the presence of extracellular calcium (Ca2+]o), shear stress induced an inward current at a holding potential of 0 mV which is accompanied by a rise in intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i). In the absence of extracellular calcium shear stress was unable to evoke a calcium signal but still induced a membrane current. The voltage dependence of the shear stress induced current was obtained from difference currents evoked by linear voltage ramps before and during application of shear stress. Its reversal potential Erev shifted from -2.3 +/- 0.8 mV (n = 4) in a nominally Ca2+ free solution to +1.5 +/- 1.6 mV at 1.5 mM [Ca2+]o (n = 4) and to +21.9 +/- 4.4 mV (n = 7) at 10 mM [Ca2+]o.

PBCO administration leads to liver enlargement. This is associated with induction of microsomal cytochrome P-450 levels (1.6- to 2.0-fold) and dependent mixed-function oxidase activities (7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase and 7-pentoxyresorufin-O-depentylase, representing cytochrome P-450I and cytochrome P-450IIB isoenzymes respectively, 9- to 15-fold; omega-oxidation of lauric acid representing the cytochrome P-450IVA1 isoenzyme, 1.4- to 1.5-fold) along with peroxisomal beta-oxidation (palmitoyl CoA oxidation, 2- to 5-fold). It was observed that rats exposed to PBCO showed an increase in renal microsomal cytochrome P-450 content (1.6- to 2.3-fold), cytochrome P-450I activity (5- to 8-fold) and omega-oxidation activity (1.3- to 1.4-fold). However, renal peroxisomal beta-oxidation was unaltered. Serum total triglycerides were lowered by 41-46% after PBCO exposure.
