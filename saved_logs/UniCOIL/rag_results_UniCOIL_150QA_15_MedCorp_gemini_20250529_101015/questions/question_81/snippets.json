        "content": "Ultrasonic vocalizations were measured when male rats were placed with ovariectomized females that had experienced various hormonal and behavioral treatments. In Experiment 1, 18 males were tested with females in each of the following conditions: nonestrous (OVX), estrogen treated (E), estrogen and progesterone treated (EP), and estrogen and progesterone treated and given two intromissions from a stud male prior to testing (EPI). Control conditions included clean cage (CL) and cage soiled by an estrous female (SOI). The treatments differed in effect on rate and maintenance of vocalization: EP greater than E greater than EPI = OVX greater than SOI greater than CL. In tests in which males produced a high rate of vocalization, some males with short intromission latencies shifted from the normal 50-kHz pulse to a 22-kHz pulse. In Experiment 2, the effect of the female's vocalization and movement on the rate of and latency to vocalization was measured. Twenty-one males were presented with each of the following stimulus conditions: estrous female with red light (EP), estrous female without red light (EP dark), estrous anesthetized female (EP anes), and nonestrous anesthetized female (OVX anes). Effects on vocalization of various treatments were as follows: EP = EP dark greater than EP anes greater than OVX anes. These data suggest that the 50-kHz vocalizations constitute a graded response influenced by the female's hormonal and sexual condition.",

In the simplest case, if we denote the enzyme by E, the substrate by S, and the product by P, the basic reaction path is E + S → ES →EP → E + P. There is a limit to the amount of substrate that a single enzyme molecule can process in a given time. Although an increase in the concentration of substrate increases the rate at which product is formed, this rate eventually reaches a maximum value (Figure 3–46). At that point the enzyme molecule is saturated with substrate, and the rate of reaction (Vmax) depends only on how rapidly the enzyme can process the substrate molecule. This maximum rate divided by the enzyme concentration is called the turnover number.

        "content": "Three monoclonal antibodies specific for different carbohydrate antigens were used to analyze the development of the olfactory system in rats. CC2 antibodies react with a subset of main olfactory neurons, their axons, and terminals in the olfactory bulb. CC2 antigens are expressed on dorsomedial neurons in the olfactory epithelium (OE) from embryonic (E) day 15 to adults. In the olfactory bulb (OB), only dorsomedially located glomeruli express CC2 glycoconjugates from postnatal day (P) 2 to adults. Thus CC2 defines a dorsomedially organized projection that is established early in embryonic development and continues in adults. P-Path antibodies react with antigens that are expressed on the olfactory nerve in embryos, and are also detected on cell bodies in the neuroepithelium and in glomeruli of the OB at P2. At P14, P-Path staining is weaker, but remains present on many cells in the epithelium and in many glomeruli in the bulb. Postnatally, P-Path immunostaining continues to decrease in most regions of the OE and OB. At P35 and afterwards, only a few P-Path-positive neuronal cells can be detected in the OE. Furthermore, after P35 only two groups of glomeruli in the OB are P-Path immunoreactive. One is situated adjacent to the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB) at the dorsocaudal surface of the OB. The other is adjacent to the AOB at the ventrocaudal surface of the OB. Thus, in adults, P-Path glycoconjugates are expressed in neurons and axons that project only to a specific subset of caudal glomeruli of the OB. Monoclonal antibody 1B2, reacts with beta-galactose-terminating glycolipids and glycoproteins. At P2, 1B2 immunoreactivity is seen on a subset of cell bodies that are distributed throughout the OE and is expressed in most glomeruli in the OB at this age. By P35 and in adults, 1B2 continues to be expressed on a subset of neurons in the OE that project to only a small subset of glomeruli in the OB. Unlike CC2 and P-Path antigens that define specific groups of glomeruli, 1B2-immunoreactive glomeruli do not have a detectable spatial pattern. It is more likely that 1B2 antigens define a specific stage in the maturation of connections between the OE and OB.",

        "contents": "Prim's algorithm. Let P be a connected, weighted graph. At every iteration of Prim's algorithm, an edge must be found that connects a vertex in a subgraph to a vertex outside the subgraph. Since P is connected, there will always be a path to every vertex. The output Y of Prim's algorithm is a tree, because the edge and vertex added to tree Y are connected. Let Y1 be a minimum spanning tree of graph P. If Y1=Y then Y is a minimum spanning tree. Otherwise, let e be the first edge added during the construction of tree Y that is not in tree Y1, and V be the set of vertices connected by the edges added before edge e. Then one endpoint of edge e is in set V and the other is not. Since tree Y1 is a spanning tree of graph P, there is a path in tree Y1 joining the two endpoints. As one travels along the path, one must encounter an edge f joining a vertex in set V to one that is not in set V. Now, at the iteration when edge e was added to tree Y, edge f could also have been added and it would be added",
