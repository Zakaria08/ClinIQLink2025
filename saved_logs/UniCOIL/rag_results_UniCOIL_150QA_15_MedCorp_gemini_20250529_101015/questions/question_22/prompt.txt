Document 1 (Title: Effects of kainic acid lesions in rat ventral lateral geniculate nucleus upon field potentials of the superior colliculus: correlation between morphological and physiological observations.): Morphological and physiological effects of kainic acid (KA) lesions in rat ventral lateral geniculate nucleus (LGV) were studied 1.5 and 6 h after KA injection. Morphological changes were examined mainly by electron micrographs. At 1.5 h after KA injection dendrites were dilated and some vacuolations occurred in both dendrites and perikarya including geniculotectal relay neurons while axons were completely intact and cell organelles almost remained intact. Six h after KA injection dendrites and cell bodies were massively dilated with degeneration of cell organelles accompanied by sparse cytoplasm and deformed chromatin in the nucleus. However, almost all presynaptic axons, mainly retinogeniculate fibers, still remained intact. The electron micrographs demonstrate that destruction occurred first in dendrites, next in cell bodies and finally axons were likely to be affected. These morphological changes induced by KA are compatible with physiological effects which were assessed by the field response of the super...
Document 2 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): The Active Cell Membrane In atrial and ventricular cells, the diastolic membrane potential (phase 4) is typically very stable. This is because it is dominated by a potassium permeability or conductance that is due to the activity of channels that generate an inward-rectifying potassium current (IK1). This keeps the membrane potential near the potassium SCN5A/Nav 1.5 Ca2+ L-type CACNA1/Cav 1.2 current T-type CACNA1G,H/Cav 3.1, 3.2 transient lto,f KCND3/Kv 4.3 outward lto,s KCNA4/Kv 1.4 lKur KCNA5/Kv 1.5 lK,ACh KCNJ3, 5/Kir 3.1, 3.4 lCl CFTR/CFTR inward rectifier, lK1 KCNJ2/Kir 2.1 pacemaker current, lf HCN2, 4/HCN2, 4 Na+/Ca2+ exchange SLC8A1/NCX 1 Na+/K+-ATPase NKAIN1-4/Na, K-pump

Document 4 (Title: Calcium Gluconate -- Administration -- Beta-Blocker and Calcium Channel Blocker Toxicity): When treating calcium channel blocker toxicity, a dose of calcium gluconate can be given as a bolus or continuous infusion. Bolus dosing is 0.6 mL/kg (60 mg/kg) of 10% calcium gluconate solution, repeated as needed every 10 to 20 minutes for 3 to 4 times and followed by a continuous infusion of 0.6 to 1.5 mL/kg/h (60 to 150 mg/kg/h). Throughout the process, ionized calcium levels require monitoring to achieve a calcium level 2 times the normal. Calcium supplementation is often an adjunct to other therapies, such as glucagon, atropine, and hyperinsulinemia/euglycemia therapy, to treat CCB toxicity. [3]
Document 5 (Title: Biochemistry, Electron Transport Chain -- Molecular Level): Flavin adenine dinucleotide has 4 redox states, 3 of them being FAD (quinone, fully oxidized form), FADH- (semiquinone, partially oxidized), and FADH2 (hydroquinone, fully reduced). FAD is made up of an adenine nucleotide and a flavin mononucleotide (FMN), connected by phosphate groups. FMN is synthesized in part from vitamin B2 (riboflavin). FAD contains a highly stable aromatic ring, and FADH2 does not. When FADH2 oxidizes, it becomes aromatic and releases energy, as seen in Reaction 3. This state makes FAD a potent oxidizing agent, with an even more positive reduction potential than NAD. FADH2 enters the ETC at complex II and creates a total of 1.5 ATP (4 H+ from complex III, and 2 H+ from complex IV; 6/4 H+ per ATP = 1.5 ATP per FADH2 **some sources round up**). [18] Reaction 3: FADH2 -> FAD +  2 H+ + 2 e-

Question: An investigator is studying the function of the lateral nucleus of the hypothalamus in an experimental animal. Using a viral vector, the genes encoding chloride-conducting channelrhodopsins are injected into this nucleus. Photostimulation of the channels causes complete inhibition of action potential generation. Persistent photostimulation is most likely to result in which of the following abnormalities in these animals?
Options:
A. Hypothermia
B. Hyperthermia
C. Polydipsia
D. Anorexia
