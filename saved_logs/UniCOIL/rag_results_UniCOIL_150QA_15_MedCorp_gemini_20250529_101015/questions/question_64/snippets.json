        "content": "Education of residents in disaster-related topics is also quite variable depending on the specialty and individual training program. While disaster preparedness training is required for emergency medicine and often provided in general surgery residencies, there is no standardized curriculum. Specialties such as family medicine and anesthesiology recommend disaster response training for residents, although it is not required. In emergency medicine residencies, the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) requires residents to have experience in “emergency preparedness and disaster management” and “participation in multi-casualty incident drills.” There are no specific requirements regarding the methods or amount of time spent on these topics. One study evaluated the average number of hours of disaster training for several specialties per year. Emergency medicine residents appear to receive the most training (7.5 hours), followed by general surgery (3.1 hours), internal medicine (1.1 hours), and pediatrics (0.5 hours). Residents in each of these specialties desired significantly more training than they received. A survey of emergency medicine program directors published in 2017 evaluated training in disaster medicine for emergency medicine residents. Of program directors surveyed, 51.6% felt “too little” time was spent on disaster medicine concepts, while only 3.1% felt they currently spend “too much” time on disaster medicine. Reasons cited for not including more disaster topics include “limited time” and “limited resources.” Topics covered at nearly all responding programs included patient triage and decontamination. Lectures and hospital disaster exercises were the most common methods of disaster training for emergency medicine residents. Less commonly used methods were tabletop exercises, rotations, and formal courses such as Basic and Advanced Disaster Life Support. According to a study comparing emergency medicine to general surgery, emergency medicine residents receive significantly more training than general surgery residents in disaster response. Despite the increased training, emergency medicine residents felt only slightly more comfortable with the concepts of disaster response than general surgery residents. Military training, decontamination training, participation in exercises, and being involved in actual disaster response were all associated with higher levels of self-reported comfort in caring for patients in a disaster situation. The existing data suggest the need for increased training in disaster response and preparedness for all resident physicians who may have a role in a disaster or mass casualty incident.",

A 22-item questionnaire was administered to residents in conjunction with the yearly American Board of Emergency Medicine inservice examination. Demographic information and factors influencing career intent were elicited. Respondents were classified by intent on a career in emergency medicine. A three-way analysis of variance was used to address group differences for eight specific factors impacting on career decision. Chi-square analysis was used to address questions involving relationships among variables with dichotomous or categorical responses. The survey was distributed to 1,654 residents, and 1,238 (75%) completed the questionnaire. Motivating factors demonstrating significant differences between those residents planning an academic career and those not interested in academe were a desire to do research, desire to teach, desire to make a contribution to medicine, and exposure to role models, with less emphasis on the need for free time for other interests and less concern regarding practice location. More than 80% of those not going into academic emergency medicine believed they were adequately exposed to research in residency compared with 65% of those intent on a career in academe (P less than .01). Research in medical school, residency, and authorship of a research paper were significantly more prevalent for those residents desiring a career in academe (P less than .01). Twenty-six percent of residents responded that their role models for research were less than adequate. Seventeen percent of residents intend to take fellowship training. The most popular fields for fellowships were toxicology (25%), emergency medical services (21%), pediatrics (15%), and research (9%). The results of this survey address attitudes among residents toward a career in academic emergency medicine.

        "content": "Ultra low-dose estrogen from a Silastic ring or vaginal cream or vaginal pill is an emerging therapy, to avoid the (albeit) small systemic absorption from current formulations of ring (releasing 7.5 μg estradiol daily) or estradiol tablets (containing 25 μg estradiol daily). These ultra low-dose formulations may prove appropriate for women with past history of breast cancer. Every woman with such history currently is treated individually by her oncologist, taking into account her sexual symptoms, the importance to her of penetrative sex, as well as her particular tumor endocrinology. Investigational local vaginal DHEA may benefit vulvar vaginal atrophy, in the absence of systemic absorption of either DHEA or the intracellularly produced estrogen or testosterone. Early research shows a generalized sexual benefit in terms of coital comfort, ease of orgasm, and sexual motivation (108).",

        "content": "A consensus project by Frallicciardi et al utilized emergency medicine simulation experts. It sought to define core content for emergency medicine simulation fellowships, which may also apply to nonemergency medicine fellowships. [4] These essential curricular objectives build a common foundation for emergency medicine simulation fellowship training. As outlined in this project, key domains were agreed upon to be crucial to fellow education and were further defined into curricular content; this included the development of a simulation-based curriculum domain, with comprehension and utilization of a variety of conceptual frameworks in simulation design, as well as evaluation of simulation-based training education efficacy and participant performance.",
