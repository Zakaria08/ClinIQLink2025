Document 1 (Title: Emergency ultrasound): Training Emergency and point-of-care ultrasound is taught in a variety of settings. Many physicians are currently taught bedside ultrasound during the emergency medicine residency or critical care fellowship training programs in the United States. It can also be learned as part of the continuing education process, through formal didactics, one-on-one training, training software, and clinical application and practice. Other specialists may learn during their residency or fellowship training programs. There are specialized fellowship training programs for bedside ultrasound in emergency medicine, but these are not required nor expected for the use of this tool in practice. Training has been expanded to other specialties in medical and surgical fields and is expected to expand in the future.

Document 2 (Title: EMS Management Of Traumatic And Medical Disorders In A Wilderness Environment -- Issues of Concern -- Education): Physicians and medical students have several other avenues available for advanced training. Many medical schools and residency programs, especially emergency medicine, now offer wilderness medicine experiences. However, these are highly variable. Several options exist for medical students and residents to complete rotations ranging from 1 to 4 weeks. In addition to these rotations, multiple universities have developed full fellowships devoted to wilderness medicine. Several fellowships focusing on EMS have also begun incorporating wilderness medicine into their curriculum. However, the ACGME has not yet accredited these wilderness medicine fellowships. The increased interest and need for greater physician involvement in WEMS has led the WMS and NAEMSP to collaborate in developing a Wilderness EMS Medical Director Course taught at several national conferences.

Document 4 (Title: Attending coverage in academic emergency medicine: a national survey.): We surveyed the 66 accredited emergency medicine residency programs in the United States during 1986 on the issue of attending coverage. Responses were received from 411 residents and 288 faculty; this accounted for 42% of the residents and 56% of the faculty from the 56 responding programs. Seventy-three percent of emergency medicine residency programs had 24-hour attending coverage. According to residents, faculty from programs with 24-hour coverage spent a greater percentage of their shift doing primary patient care than faculty from programs without 24-hour coverage (35% vs 17%, respectively, P less than .0001), and a smaller percentage of their shift educating residents (21% vs 30%, respectively, P less than .0001). Ninety-five percent of faculty and 71% of residents thought that the quality of patient care was better when faculty were present in the ED (P less than .0001). Sixty-one percent of residents and 60% of faculty did not think that 24-hour attending coverage in academic emergency medicine shoul...
Document 5 (Title: Obstentrics_Williams): Court ruling in the case of Who/� Woman 5 Health v. Helerstedt. With this, the justices noted that abortion laws must confer health safety benefits that outweigh burdens on access. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (2014a, 2017 d) supports the legal right of women to obtain an abortion prior to fetal viability and advocates for improved access. he College also (2017 a) supports abortion training, and the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education mandates that obstetrics and gynecology residency education must include access to experience with induced abortion. The Kenneth J. Ryan Residency Training Program was established in 1999 to work with residency programs to improve abortion and contraceptive training. Moreover, postresidency training in these techniques is available in formal 2-year Family Planning fellowships.
