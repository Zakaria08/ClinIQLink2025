        "content": "Data from the North American Pediatric Renal Transplant Cooperative Study were analyzed to determine the effect of donor age on graft survival for pediatric recipients of cadaver donor renal transplants. Between January 1, 1987, and November 16, 1990, 787 cadaver donor renal transplants in children less than 18 years of age were registered in the study. The ages of the donors were less than or equal to 5 years in 203 transplants, between 6 and 9 years in 87, between 10 and 39 in 389, and greater than or equal to 40 years in 108. The risk of graft loss was related to donor age by a proportional hazards analysis. The ideal donor age was 20-25 years. The risk of graft loss was increased by both young and old donor age. The risk of graft loss from a neonate donor was 2.7-fold that of the ideal donor, and the risk from a 50-year-old donor was 1.8-fold that of the ideal donor. The relationship between donor age and graft survival was not affected by the age of the recipient. Cold storage time had an added impact on graft survival: grafts with cold storage time greater than 24 hr were 1.5 times more likely to fail than grafts with shorter cold storage time for all donor ages. Analysis of the causes of graft failure revealed that 9.9% of grafts from donors less than or equal to 5 years of age were lost due to vascular thrombosis, primary nonfunction, and other technical causes, compared with 4.6% in 6-9, 4.4% in 10-39, and 2.8% in greater than or equal to 40-year-old donors. We conclude that kidneys from both young and old donors are at increased risk for graft loss, and this increased risk is seen in all recipient age groups. Many of the losses from the young donors--but not older donors--may be due to technical causes. Knowledge of these risks can be used to develop strategies for optimal utilization of kidneys from young and old donors.",
