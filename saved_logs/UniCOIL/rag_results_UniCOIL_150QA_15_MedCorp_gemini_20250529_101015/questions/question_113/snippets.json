Dopamine (2.5 to 5 mug/kg per min) and isoproterenol (0.125 to 0.25 mug/kg per min) were randomly infused for 20 minutes, and segmental tension (Walton-Brodie gauge) of central ischemic, border and nonischemic myocardial zones and epicardial electrograms (10 to 12 sites) were simultaneously recorded. After coronary occlusion, tension in border zones decreased to 73.5 +/- 6.4 percent (mean +/- standard error of the mean) and tension in central zones to 60.6 +/- 9.9 percent (P less than  0.001) of control level, whereas total S-T elevation (sigmaST) rose from 10.8 +/- 1.6 to 98.4 +/- 14.0 mv and average S-T elevation (ST) from 1.6 +/- 0.2 to 10.8 +/- 1.6 mv (P less than 0.001). Isoproterenol increased heart rate from 148.7 +/- 6.9 to 170.6 +/- 7.7 beats/min (P less than 0.010) and improved tension in the border zone to 110.5 +/- 8.5 percent (P less than 0.010) and improved tension in the border zone to 110.5 +/- 8.5 percent (P less than 0.005) and nonischemic zone to 128.4 +/- 6.7 percent (P less than 0.02).

Dopamine did not change heart rate but increased tension in the border zone from 72.4 +/- 7.9 to 124.4 +/- 16.8 percent (P less than 0.001) and tension in the nonischemic zone from 86.0 +/- 10.0 to 133.3 +/- 10.0 percent (P less than 0.01).

Atrial pacing was used to increase heart rate during infusion of dopamine to 180.0 +/- 7.6 beats/min but neither sigmaST nor ST increased.

        "content": "Studies were carried out with a new, concentrated perfluorochemical emulsion (PFCE) of the perfluorochemical F44E (48% V/V). When given at 4, 1.6, or 1 g/kg in undiluted injection volumes iv 1 hr prior to a range of single doses of radiation with inspired carbogen dose modifying factors (DMF's) based on tumor growth delay (TGD) in the Lewis lung tumor of 2.5, 1.7, and 1.5, respectively, were produced. When the PFC dose was administered in a volume of 0.2 ml, the dose modifying factors produced by 4 g/kg (0.1 ml undiluted) did not change significantly (2.6), but the dose modifying factors produced by 1.6 g/kg (0.04 ml undiluted) and by 1.0 g/kg (0.025 ml undiluted) increased significantly to 2.0 and 1.8 (p less than 0.05), respectively. Using the tumor excision assay at 24 hr post treatment in the FSaIIC fibrosarcoma, administration of 6, 4, or 2 g/kg in 0.2 ml injections plus carbogen breathing 1 hr prior to and during treatment resulted in dose modifying factors of 1.5, 1.6, and 1.3, respectively. In a fractionated radiation protocol in the Lewis lung tumor using four daily fractions, a dose of 4 g/kg of PFC on days 1 and 3 proved superior to a dose of 2 g/kg daily (dose modifying factors 2.4 vs. 1.9, p less than 0.05). When a fractionated radiation regimen of 3 Gy daily X 5 and carbogen was used, PFC doses of 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 g/kg administered undiluted produced increasing tumor growth delays with increasing dose of PFCE and increasing frequency of administration. In addition, dilutions to 0.2 ml proved significantly more effective. In a 2-week fractionated radiation protocol using 2, 3, or 4 Gy daily X 5 weekly, PFCE given in 0.2 ml volume plus carbogen breathing daily at 4, 1.6, or 1 g/kg produced dose modifying factors of 2.0, 1.9, and 1.6, respectively. Finally, when used in a day 1, 3, and 5 radiation regimen for 3 weeks at 2, 3, or 4 Gy/fraction, 4 g/kg of PFCE given in a volume of 0.2 ml plus carbogen breathing produced a superior dose modifying factor (1.6) as compared with 1.6 or 1.0 g/kg (dose modifying factors 1.4 and 1.3, respectively). These results indicate that PFCE plus carbogen breathing effectively enhances the antitumor effects of both single dose and fractionated radiation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

Studies were carried out with a new, concentrated perfluorochemical emulsion (PFCE) of the perfluorochemical F44E (48% V/V). When given at 4, 1.6, or 1 g/kg in undiluted injection volumes iv 1 hr prior to a range of single doses of radiation with inspired carbogen dose modifying factors (DMF's) based on tumor growth delay (TGD) in the Lewis lung tumor of 2.5, 1.7, and 1.5, respectively, were produced.
