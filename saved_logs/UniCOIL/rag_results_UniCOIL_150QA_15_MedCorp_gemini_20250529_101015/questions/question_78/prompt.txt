Document 1 (Title: Specific absorption rate): Specific absorption rate (SAR) is a measure of the rate at which energy is absorbed per unit mass by a human body when exposed to a radio frequency (RF) electromagnetic field. It can also refer to absorption of other forms of energy by tissue, including ultrasound. It is defined as the power absorbed per mass of tissue and has units of watts per kilogram (W/kg). SAR is usually averaged either over the whole body, or over a small sample volume (typically 1 g or 10 g of tissue). The value cited is then the maximum level measured in the body part studied over the stated volume or mass. Calculation SAR for electromagnetic energy can be calculated from the electric field within the tissue as:
Document 2 (Title: Lung Perfusion Scan -- Normal and Critical Findings -- Preoperative planning for Lung Volume Reduction Surgery): Lung volume reduction surgery is performed in select patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) to improve symptoms by resectioning damaged lung tissue. [18] V/Q scan can be used to evaluate patients who are candidates for surgery. Scintigraphy allows visualization of ventilation and perfusion of the lungs and can help identify the parts of the lung severely affected in heterogeneous emphysema. Newer modalities, such as quantitative CT and dual-energy CT, are now available and have the added benefit of providing structural information. [19]
Document 3 (Title: Histology_Ross): Lymphatic vessel, fngertip, human, Mallory ×375. The lymphatic vessel shown here is contained within dense irregular connective tissue (DCT). The lumen is irregular, appearing relatively narrow below the valve (Val). A few endothelial cell nuclei are evident (arrows). A thin layer of connective tissue that is present outside of the endothelium blends with the dense connective tissue beyond the wall of the vessel. A venule (V) is also present; it can readily be distinguished from the lymphatic vessel by the presence of red blood cells in the lumen.

Document 4 (Title: Airway resistance): Derived parameters Airway conductance (GAW) This is simply the mathematical inverse of airway resistance. Specific airway resistance (sRaw) Where V is the lung volume at which RAW was measured. Also called volumic airway resistance. Due to the elastic nature of the tissue that supports the small airways airway resistance changes with lung volume. It is not practically possible to measure airway resistance at a set absolute lung volume, therefore specific airway resistance attempts to correct for differences in lung volume at which different measurements of airway resistance were made. Specific airway resistance is often measured at FRC, in which case: Specific airway conductance (sGaw) Where V is the lung volume at which GAW was measured. Also called volumic airway conductance. Similarly to specific airway resistance, specific airway conductance attempts to correct for differences in lung volume. Specific airway conductance is often measured at FRC, in which case:
Document 5 (Title: Volume corrected mitotic index (M/V-INDEX). The standard of mitotic activity in neoplasms.): Estimation of mitotic activity by counting the number of mitotic figures per high power fields is subject to many sources of error. The microscope fields vary in size in different microscopes, which makes comparisons arbitrary. Also the areas covered by neoplastic and non-neoplastic tissue in the microscope image vary in different tumors. We found that each microscope could easily be characterized in terms of the size of the microscope field at 40x objective magnification (usually at ocular magnification of 10x). We also found that the number of mitotic figures can be related to the area covered by neoplastic tissue in the microscope field. The resulting index, the volume corrected mitotic index (M/V-index) will express the mitotic activity as the number of mitotic figures per square millimeter of neoplastic tissue in the microscope fields. The M/V-index will not be subject to the variation in volume fractions of neoplastic tissue between different neoplasms. With the M/V-index the mitotic activity as measure...
