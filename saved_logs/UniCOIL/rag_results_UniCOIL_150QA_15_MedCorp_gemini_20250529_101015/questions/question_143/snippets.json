        "content": "To evaluate the efficacy and safety of a pH-sensitive, polymer-coated oral preparation of mesalamine in patients with mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis. A multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial. Five university-based medical centers, one inflammatory bowel disease center, and three private practice sites. A total of 158 patients with newly or previously diagnosed active ulcerative colitis. A pH-sensitive, polymer-coated oral preparation of mesalamine (5-aminosalicylic acid) was used at 1.6 and 2.4 g/d for 6 weeks. Efficacy was measured by scores for stool frequency, rectal bleeding, patient's functional assessment, sigmoidoscopic findings, and physician's global assessment. Stringent criteria for disease activity were established prospectively. The analysis of protocol-compliant patients showed a significant improvement at 3 weeks in patients taking 2.4 g/d of mesalamine compared with patients taking placebo (32% versus 9%; P = 0.003). At 6 weeks, both the 1.6 g/d (43%) and 2.4 g/d (49%) doses were significantly superior to placebo (23%) (P = 0.03 and P = 0.003, respectively). In addition, more patients worsened in the placebo group compared with the 2.4 g/d group (50% versus 19%; P = 0.003); however, there was no statistically significant difference in worsening between the 1.6 g/d mesalamine group and the placebo group. The oral mesalamine tablet was well tolerated, and no clinically significant changes were observed in hematologic, hepatic, or renal laboratory profiles. Colon-targeted oral mesalamine at 2.4 g/d is effective therapy for mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis. It is well tolerated and should provide a viable therapeutic alternative to sulfasalazine.",

The in vitro release pattern from this optimized matrix tablet was reproducible. Accelerated stability studies revealed that the optimized formulation remains stable for an approximately 2-year shelf life. This sustained-release (SR) tablet was evaluated in dogs, and for comparison a conventional (CV) formulation was also given at the same dose level. Plasma oxprenolol levels were monitored by a sensitive and specific high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method. Significant differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters, i.e., lower Cmax, higher values of tmax, MRT, AUC, and plasma concentration at 24 hr, and nearly constant plasma levels over 12 hr, indicated that the SR matrix tablet is superior to the CV rapid-releasing formulation.

        "content": "New pharmaceutical formulations of the oxime HI-6 as sustained-release and conventional tablets were studied in healthy volunteers. Twenty-six subjects, divided into 3 groups, received 3784 mg or 7568 mg doses of HI-6 conventional tablets or 4027 mg of the oxime in the form of sustained-release tablets. Peak plasma concentrations of HI-6 were reached within 0.6 h (10.2 mumol/l) and 1.6 h (21.4 mumol/l) following the ingestion of conventional tablets. Elimination half-lives were similar (1.7 h and 1.3 h) and the respective urinary recoveries amounted to 3.2% and 2.9%. After the administration of sustained-release tablets of HI-6, maximal concentration (8.8 mumol/l) was attained in 2.2 h, elimination half-life was 1.9 h and 4.2% of the dose was excreted unchanged in urine. Undesirable side effects were not reported by the subjects or revealed by clinical or laboratory tests. The results indicate low bioavailability of the oral formulations of HI-6 in man.",
