Myelitis causes spinal cord dysfunction, which can cause muscle weakness, paralysis in the limbs, lost or reduced sensation, spasms, loss of bladder and bowel control or erectile dysfunction. The myelitis can be transverse, affecting an entire cross-section of the spinal cord, and causing bilateral symptoms. The second most common initial manifestation of the disease is inflammation of the optic nerve and/or optic chiasm (optic neuritis, ON). ON may lead to varying degrees as visual impairment with decreased visual acuity, although visual field defects, or loss of color vision may occur in isolation or prior to formal loss of visual acuity. Compared to idiopathic ON and ON due to multiple sclerosis (MS), ON due to NMOSD more often has severe visual loss at onset, bilateral involvement, and permanent visual deficits.",

Although outmoded for treatment of nonpregnant individuals, repeated lumbar punctures are generally successful in providing temporary relief throughout pregnancy.

We report the case of a man who developed transient cortical blindness followed by permanent visual deficits during repeated partial seizures. Intermittent visual impairment began at age 14 years. After he had the first generalized seizure at age 28 years, neurologic, ophthalmologic, angiographic, and brain computed tomographic (CT) examinations were normal. Several EEGs showed almost continuous biposterior spike-waves. Over the next several years, frequent partial seizures were associated with transient visual loss and left body twitching or paresthesias. When he was 32, transient blindness occurred during several days of repeated occipital seizures. Permanent left homonymous hemianopia, right homonymous central scotoma, dyschromatopsia, and altered stereopsis followed these seizures. Brain CT demonstrated a new right occipital lesion. Partial seizures arising posteriorly may cause transient cortical blindness and result in permanent visual deficits.",
