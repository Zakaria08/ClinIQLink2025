When the PFC dose was administered in a volume of 0.2 ml, the dose modifying factors produced by 4 g/kg (0.1 ml undiluted) did not change significantly (2.6), but the dose modifying factors produced by 1.6 g/kg (0.04 ml undiluted) and by 1.0 g/kg (0.025 ml undiluted) increased significantly to 2.0 and 1.8 (p less than 0.05), respectively. Using the tumor excision assay at 24 hr post treatment in the FSaIIC fibrosarcoma, administration of 6, 4, or 2 g/kg in 0.2 ml injections plus carbogen breathing 1 hr prior to and during treatment resulted in dose modifying factors of 1.5, 1.6, and 1.3, respectively. In a fractionated radiation protocol in the Lewis lung tumor using four daily fractions, a dose of 4 g/kg of PFC on days 1 and 3 proved superior to a dose of 2 g/kg daily (dose modifying factors 2.4 vs. 1.9, p less than 0.05). When a fractionated radiation regimen of 3 Gy daily X 5 and carbogen was used, PFC doses of 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 g/kg administered undiluted produced increasing tumor growth delays with increasing dose of PFCE and increasing frequency of administration. In addition, dilutions to 0.2 ml proved significantly more effective. In a 2-week fractionated radiation protocol using 2, 3, or 4 Gy daily X 5 weekly, PFCE given in 0.2 ml volume plus carbogen breathing daily at 4, 1.6, or 1 g/kg produced dose modifying factors of 2.0, 1.9, and 1.6, respectively. Finally, when used in a day 1, 3, and 5 radiation regimen for 3 weeks at 2, 3, or 4 Gy/fraction, 4 g/kg of PFCE given in a volume of 0.2 ml plus carbogen breathing produced a superior dose modifying factor (1.6) as compared with 1.6 or 1.0 g/kg (dose modifying factors 1.4 and 1.3, respectively).

        "content": "We used selective inhibitors of the asparagine-linked oligosaccharide processing pathway to study the effect of sugar trimming on the functional properties of the nicotinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptor expressed in clonal mammalian BC3H-1 cells. Inhibitors of initial steps of the processing pathway (1-deoxynojirimycin[DNJ] and castanospermine[CS]) reduced the density of ACh receptors on the cell surface (3- to 5-fold) but their responsiveness to ACh was more reduced (5- to 10-fold). These results suggest that the function of the ACh receptor was altered. When the ACh receptors were expressed in the presence of DNJ or CS, analysis of ACh-evoked single-channel currents (-100 mV and 11 degrees C) revealed an approximate threefold reduction in the opening rate (control: 600-650 s(-1)), treated: 130-250 s(-1)) and an approximate twofold reduction in the rate of agonist dissociation (control: 900-1,000 s(-1), treated: 400-500 s(-1)). In addition, the proportion of brief duration bursts (tau = 50-100 microseconds) was increased (1.5- to 2-fold) by treatments with DNJ or CS. In contrast, an inhibitor of a late processing step (swainsonine) did not produce such alterations. The single-channel conductance was not altered by any of the three inhibitors, and the slopes of log-log dose-response curves at low concentrations and desensitization did not appear to be affected. Each inhibitor altered the electrophoretic mobility of the ACh receptor subunits. We conclude that early sugar trimming can influence the kinetics of the nicotinic ACh receptor in BC3H-1 cells.",

        "content": "Effects of carbon disulphide (CS2) on conduction velocity in sciatic and tibial nerve were investigated in rats exposed to CS2 vapour at concentrations of 0.9 mg/l or 1.6 mg/l of air for periods of 1.5, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. The conduction velocity was measured on the day following each exposure period, and again, three and six months after the last day of exposure. The majority of exposed rats showed a reduction in conduction velocity on the day after exposure: the extent of this reduction was dependent on the CS2 concentration and the duration of exposure. Exposure for 1.5 months to 1.6 mg CS2/l produced temporary and fully reversible impairment of conduction velocity. Increased exposure to CS2 (3,6 or 9 months at 1.6 mg/l; 6 or 12 months at 0.9 mg/l CS2 in air) caused a reduction in velocity which was only partially reversible.",

This Accent was also the first to get a diesel version, with a 1.5-litre three-cylinder direct injection turbodiesel, which was badged CRDi. Trim levels were GSi, CDX and MVi: this was standard on most export versions, although some European markets had their own designations with names like Dynamic=Version etc. Some markets used LS and GLS. Marketing North America In North America the Accent was available in GL, GLS and GT trim levels only, with the 1.5-litre engine at first, then the 1.6-litre engine from 2002. The GT version was similar to the MVi version marketed in Europe and Oceania, although the body kit was not as overtly hot hatch styled.",
