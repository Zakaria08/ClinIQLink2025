        "content": "Monitoring and laboratory tests : Regular monitoring with laboratory testing is sometimes needed to ensure efficacy and safety. Patients on UFH should be monitored to maintain an aPTT in the therapeutic range of 1.5 to 2.5 times the control 6 hours after the injection. Anticoagulation with LMWH can be monitored by following anti-factor Xa levels. However, the need to monitor these patients remains uncertain. For those on weight-based therapeutic doses, studies in which anti-factor Xa levels have been monitored with a goal of 0.6 to 1.0 units/mL, show that few patients will require dosing adjustments beyond those they would already receive as their weight naturally increases during pregnancy. The decision to monitor patients on therapeutic LMWH should, therefore, be based on institutional protocols and clinical judgment. Additionally, optimal anti-factor Xa levels have not been determined for patients receiving prophylactic LMWH, so patients on prophylactic doses rarely require regular monitoring. Finally, close attention should be given to routine laboratory tests, including platelet counts, to detect any signs of adverse effects of the anticoagulants (eg, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia).

        "content": "Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been shown to be effective in the treatment of acute soft tissue injuries. However, taken orally, NSAIDs have a definite incidence of gastro-intestinal toxicity. Since acute soft tissue trauma is normally localised, use of a topical NSAID may eliminate this undesirable side-effect. This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a topical NSAID, biphenylacetic acid 3% gel (Traxam) in the treatment of soft tissue trauma. Thirty-two patients (22 males and 10 females) with acute soft tissue trauma were enrolled at the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, National University Hospital, Singapore from 7 June 1988 to 28 March 1989. Each patient was treated for a period of one week with bipenylacetic acid 3% gel (Traxam), 60 mg three times a day. Statistically significant improvement was found in pain, swelling and functional impairment in all patients assessed at day 3 and day 7 after the injury. The speed of recovery was enhanced. The medication was found to be well tolerated and safe.",
