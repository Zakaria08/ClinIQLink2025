Document 1 (Title: Molecular cloning of a putative receptor protein kinase gene encoded at the self-incompatibility locus of Brassica oleracea.): Self-recognition between pollen and stigma during pollination in Brassica oleracea is genetically controlled by the multiallelic self-incompatibility locus (S). We describe the S receptor kinase (SRK) gene, a previously uncharacterized gene that resides at the S locus. The nucleotide sequences of genomic DNA and of cDNAs corresponding to SRK predict a putative transmembrane receptor having serine/threonine-specific protein kinase activity. Its extracellular domain exhibits striking homology to the secreted product of the S-locus glycoprotein (SLG) gene and is connected via a single pass transmembrane domain to a protein kinase catalytic center. SRK alleles derived from different S-locus genotypes are highly polymorphic and have apparently evolved in unison with genetically linked alleles of SLG. SRK directs the synthesis of several alternative transcripts, which potentially encode different protein products, and these transcripts were detected exclusively in reproductive organs. The identification of SRK may ...
Document 2 (Title: Third-Generation Cephalosporins -- Monitoring -- Antibiotic Resistance): Several strategies are being studied to combat antibiotic resistance. In addition to the possibility of developing new molecules, biotechnology offers an interesting perspective that can help design novel drug delivery methods. In particular, nanoparticles could be favorably adopted as a vehicle for antimicrobials. For example, chitosan is a natural polymer used to load various drugs that can provide prolonged release of ceftriaxone and other antibiotics. [53] The early identification of third-generation cephalosporins resistant Enterobacterales directly from positive blood cultures is another potential strategy to avoid fruitless and dangerous therapies. In this regard, research is ongoing to develop reliable methods. [54]
Document 3 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Physiologists historically have had more of a (bio)engineering perspective on the conduct of their studies and have been among the first systems biologists. Yet, with few exceptions, they, too, have focused on comparatively simple physiologic systems that are tractable using 87e-1 conventional reductionist approaches. Efforts at integrative modeling of human physiologic systems, as first attempted by Guyton for blood pressure regulation, represent one application of systems engineering to human biology. These dynamic physiologic models often focus on the acute response of a measurable physiologic parameter to a system perturbation, and do so from a classic analytic perspective in which all the conventional physiologic determinants of the output parameter are known and can be modeled quantitatively.
