Document 1 (Title: Temazepam -- Mechanism of Action -- Pharmacokinetics): Absorption: Temazepam is efficiently absorbed after oral administration, with a minimal first-pass metabolism of only 8%. The time to reach peak plasma concentration (Tmax) varies between 1.2 and 1.6 hours, with an average Tmax of 1.5 hours after administration. [23]
Document 2 (Title: Pharmacokinetics of intravenous enoximone in dialysis patients.): The new vasodilator and inotropic drug enoximone was given to dialysis patients as a single intravenous dose of 1 mg/kg. Plasma concentrations were measured up to 240 min. The mother compound enoximone reached a high plasma concentration intravenously, followed by a quick decline of the plasma concentration curve (t1/2 = 1.5 h), comparable to that of normal volunteers. The sulfoxide metabolite, however, had a tremendously prolonged half-life (t1/2 = 7.8 h) in comparison to healthy volunteers (t1/2 = 2.2 h). The volume of distribution of enoximone varies from 0.7-4.8 L/kg with a mean of 2.11 L/kg in comparison to 1.6 L/kg in healthy individuals. The area under the curve (AUC) of enoximone was 815.2 ng/ml/h, and that of the sulfoxide metabolite was 10,200.1 ng/ml/h.
Document 3 (Title: Dextromoramide): Medical use The main advantage of this drug is that it has a fast onset of action when taken orally, and has a high bioavailability which means that oral dosing produces almost as much effect as injection. It also has a relatively low tendency to cause constipation which is a common problem with opioid analgesics used for cancer pain relief, and tolerance to the analgesic effects develops relatively slowly compared to most other short-acting opioids. Pharmacokinetics Dextromoramide has a mean elimination half life of 215.3 +/- 78.4 minutes and volume of distribution of 0.58 +/- 0.20 L/kg. Peak plasma levels are reached within 0.5-4.0 h after dosing, decline of plasma concentrations after the peak follow a biphasic pattern, with half-lives of 0.4-1.6 h for the first phase and 6.3-21.8 h for the terminal phase. While in about 40% of patients, half-lives from 1.5 to 4.7 h, in a monophasic manner. Less than 0.06% of the dose is excreted unchanged in urine within 8 h of administration.
