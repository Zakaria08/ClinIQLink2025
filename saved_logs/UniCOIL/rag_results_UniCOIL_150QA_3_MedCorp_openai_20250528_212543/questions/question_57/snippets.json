        "content": "Patients who report movements during sleep, such as kicking, punching, arm-flailing, or jumping from bed in response to violent dreams, could suffer from REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD). The patient can recall the dream if he awakens during the episode. This disorder may be associated with other medical conditions such as Parkinson disease, Lewy body dementia, or multiple system atrophy. [19] Other sleep-related symptoms that require detailed history to reach a clinical diagnosis include sleepwalking, sleep talking, and night terrors (common in children aged 2 to 12) and usually resolve spontaneously as the child ages). They mainly occur in non-REM sleep, without memory of the event. On the other hand, nightmares occur during REM sleep, usually in the middle of the night and early morning. During a nightmare, the person may scream and yell out things.",

        "content": "A stressor is generally an event of a serious, unusual nature that an individual or group of individuals experience. Adjustment disorders can come from a wide range of stressors that can be traumatic or relatively minor, like the loss of a girlfriend/boyfriend, a poor report card, or moving to a new neighborhood. It is thought that the more often the stressor occurs, the more likely it is to produce Adjustment disorder. The objective nature of the stressor is of secondary importance. A stressor gains its pathogenic potential when the patient perceives it as stressful. The identification of a causal stressor is necessary if a diagnosis of adjustment disorder is to be made. There are certain stressors that are more common in different age groups:",
