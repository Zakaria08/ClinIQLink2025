Document 1 (Title: Synthesis of sorbistin analogues.): D-Galactose was converted into the glycosylating agents 4-azido-2,3-di-O-benzyl-4-deoxy-6-O-propionyl-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl chloride (11) and the methyl beta-D-thiopyranoside 19. Condensation of 11 with 2,5-diazido-1,6-di-O-benzoyl-2,5-di-deoxy-L-iditol in the presence of mercury salts gave 24% of 2,5-diazido-3-O-(4-azido-2,3-di-O-benzyl-4-deoxy-6-O-propionyl-alp ha-D- glucopyranosyl)-1,6-di-O-benzoyl-2,5-dideoxy-L-iditol. Methyl trifluoromethanesulfonate-promoted glycosylation of 1,3-diazido-2-O-benzyl-1,3-dideoxy-5,6-O-isopropylidene-D-gulit ol with 19 in the presence of 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylpyridine gave 1,3-diazido-4-O-(4-azido-2,3-di-O-benzyl-4-deoxy-6-O-propionyl-alp ha-D- glucopyranosyl)-2-O-benzyl-1,3-dideoxy-5,6-O-isopropylidene-D-gulitol (42), whereas, in the absence of base, migration of the O-isopropylidene group occurred, affording 1,3-diazido-6-O-(4-azido-2,3-di-O-benzyl-4-deoxy-6-O-propionyl-alp ha-D- glucopyranosyl)-2-O-benzyl-1,3-dideoxy-4,5-O-isopropylidene-D-gulitol in addition to 42.
Document 2 (Title: Pseudoappendicitis -- Pathophysiology): Y enterocolitica has approximately 60 serogroups typed by their O and H lipopolysaccharide surface antigens. Most subtypes are nonpathogenic to humans. Pathologic serogroups in humans include but are not limited to O:3, O:8, and O:9. Animals and humans infected with this bacteria who never develop symptoms or convalesce from a symptomatic episode may become carriers. [8]
Document 3 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): O−Nitric oxide (NO) Vasodilator, platelet inhibitor, immune regulator, neurotransmitter Oxidant and nitrating agent Can form from nonspecific donation of an electron from metals to NO Exhibits NO-like effects, possibly by first being oxidized to NO Anesthetic Auto-oxidation product of NO that can nitrosylate protein thiols Stable oxidation product of NO Slowly metabolized to nitrosothiols, and decomposes to NO at acidic pH Stable oxidation product of NO N=O•O=N−O−O−N−=O N−=N+=O O=N=O−Peroxynitrite (NO3 −) Nitrite (NO2 −) Nitrate (NO3 −) Nitroxyl anion (NO−) Nitrous oxide (N2O) Dinitrogen trioxide (N2O3) O=N−N+=O O=N+−O−O− arginine-binding site. Since each of the NOS isoforms has high structural similarity, most of these inhibitors do not exhibit selectivity for individual NOS isoforms. In inflammatory disorders and sepsis (see below), inhibition of the iNOS isoform is potentially beneficial, whereas in neurodegenerative conditions, nNOS-specific inhibitors may be useful. However,
