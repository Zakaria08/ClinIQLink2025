Document 1 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): time but not lymph node yield. However, evidence that a lab-based technical and cognitive skills test predicts observed operative technical skill in practicing surgeons is promising and warrants investigative follow-up.At the present time, the American Board of Surgery’s requirements for Maintenance of Certification (MOC) do not specifically include any certification of technical skills that might use surgical simulation.188 Nonetheless, simulation training and testing can be made available to surgeons in practice to provide an avenue for specific training. Although most investigations of VR use for laparoscopy have examined basic skills acquisition in the lab setting far in advance of any measured impact in the clinical OR, a recent innovative study of the use of a VR simulator for “warm-up” practice immediately before a procedure showed that this improved OR performance.189 As new surgical procedures and technologies are introduced to clinical practice, simulation training solutions
