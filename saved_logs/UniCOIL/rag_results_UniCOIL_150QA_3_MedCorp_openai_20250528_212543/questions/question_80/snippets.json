        "content": "To evaluate the casemix seen during an internal medicine clerkship and to assess the educational value of the problems seen. A modified Delphi-group opinion technique was used to develop a clerk log that included priority problems for internal medicine. Over a 12-month period, clerks recorded their exposure to the problems seen during their eight-week rotations. General internists rated the importance of each of the problems on a three-point scale. The inpatient internal medicine services in six university teaching hospitals. All clinical clerks in a single undergraduate year recorded their experiences. All university-based general internists participated in rating problem importance. The final approved log contained 72 problems, 64 of which received importance ratings greater than or equal to 2 on the three-point scale. The frequency of clerk exposure per problem was high and the correlation between frequency of exposure and importance was good. Ten important problems had relatively low exposure and four problems of lower importance had high exposure. The clinical clerks were exposed to a broad spectrum of diseases, but some key problems were not well represented on the wards. Alternative strategies, including increased ambulatory care exposure, will be required to complete the exposure and to assure that the quality of patient exposure matches the quantity.",

        "content": "Before the surgical excision of mucoceles or ranulas, it is mandatory to consult with a radiologist to help in defining the boundaries and extension of the lesion. This would prove to be of paramount significance for the surgeon in terms of a better outcome of the surgery by avoiding severe complications. Consultation with the anesthesiologist becomes necessary when the ranula is large enough to cause respiratory compromise.",

The two-week training courses for Ethiopian surgeons, anesthesiologists and nurses take place at JUSH (Jimma University Specialized Hospital), the only hospital serving the 15 million-plus people living in Ethiopia’s southwestern region. The rotations cover cleft surgery as well as techniques to better heal burn, trauma and surgical wounds, representing the bulk of the hospital’s plastic surgery cases.",
