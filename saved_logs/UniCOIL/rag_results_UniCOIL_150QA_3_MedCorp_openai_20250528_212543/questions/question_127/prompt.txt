Document 2 (Title: Mechanism of C-3 hydrogen exchange and the elimination of ammonia in the 3-methylaspartate ammonia-lyase reaction.): The enzyme 3-methylaspartate ammonia-lyase (EC 4.3.1.2) catalyzes the exchange of the C-3 hydrogen of the substrate, (2S,3S)-3-methylaspartic acid, with solvent hydrogen. The mechanism of the exchange reaction was probed using (2S,3S)-3-methylaspartic acid and its C-3-deuteriated isotopomer. Incubations conducted in tritiated water allowed the rate of protium or deuterium wash-out from the substrates to be measured as tritium wash-in. The primary deuterium isotope effects for the exchange under essentially Vmax conditions ( [S] much greater than Km) were 1.6, 1.5, and 1.5 at pH 9.0, 7.6, and 6.5. The deamination reaction, measured spectrophotometrically on the same incubations, showed isotope effects of 1.7, 1.6, and 1.4 at pH 9.0, 7.6, and 6.5, in agreement with the values of DV and D(V/K) reported previously [Botting, N.P., Akhtar, M., Cohen, M.A., &amp; Gani, D. (1988) Biochemistry 27, 2956-2959]. The ratio of the rate of exchange to the rate of deamination, however, varied widely with pH. Together with th...
Document 3 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Unburned cured tobacco used orally contains nicotine, carcinogens, and other toxicants capable of causing gum disease, oral and pancreatic cancers, and an increase in the risk of heart disease. When tobacco is burned, the resultant smoke contains, in addition to nicotine, more than 7000 other compounds that result from volatilization, pyrolysis, and pyrosynthesis of tobacco and various chemical additives used in making different tobacco products. The smoke is composed of a fine aerosol and a vapor phase; aerosolized particles are of a size range that results in deposition in the airways and alveolar surfaces of the lungs.
