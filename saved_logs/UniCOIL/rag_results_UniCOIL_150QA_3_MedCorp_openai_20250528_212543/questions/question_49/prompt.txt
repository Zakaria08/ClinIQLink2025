Document 1 (Title: The prevalence and incidence of lower extremity amputation in a diabetic population.): To describe the incidence of lower extremity amputations and sores or ulcers and investigate risk factors for these complications. Cohort. Primary care. Population-based sample (N = 1210) of younger-onset diabetic persons (diagnosed before age 30 years and taking insulin) and a stratified random sample (N = 1780) of older-onset diabetic persons (diagnosed after age 30 years). Baseline and 4-year follow-up examinations were completed by 996 and 891 younger-onset persons, respectively, and by 1370 and 987 older-onset persons, respectively. Amputations and sores or ulcers of the lower extremities. Four-year incidence of amputations was 2.2% in both groups. Incidence of sores or ulcers was 9.5% in younger-onset and 10.5% in older-onset persons. In younger-onset persons, significant risk factors for amputation with odds ratios (and 95% confidence intervals) include age, 2.0 for 10 years (1.2 to 3.1), history of sores or ulcers, 10.5 (3.7 to 29.8), diastolic blood pressure, 2.1 for 10 mm Hg (1.3 to 3.5), and pack-y...
Document 2 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Unburned cured tobacco used orally contains nicotine, carcinogens, and other toxicants capable of causing gum disease, oral and pancreatic cancers, and an increase in the risk of heart disease. When tobacco is burned, the resultant smoke contains, in addition to nicotine, more than 7000 other compounds that result from volatilization, pyrolysis, and pyrosynthesis of tobacco and various chemical additives used in making different tobacco products. The smoke is composed of a fine aerosol and a vapor phase; aerosolized particles are of a size range that results in deposition in the airways and alveolar surfaces of the lungs.

Document 3 (Title: Hepatitis B -- Treatment / Management -- Management): Acute hepatitis B infection is self cleared in 95% of healthy adults. Management is supportive in a majority of patients. Patients with severe acute disease (2 of the 3: bilirubin more than 10 mg/dl, INR more than 1.6 and hepatic encephalopathy) and protracted acute severe disease (total bilirubin more than 3 mg/dl or direct bilirubin more than 1.5 mg/dl, INR more than 1.5, hepatic encephalopathy, or ascites) need antiviral treatment.

Question: A 35-year-old woman with a history of Crohn disease presents for a follow-up appointment. She says that lately, she has started to notice difficulty walking. She says that some of her friends have joked that she appears to be walking as if she was drunk. Past medical history is significant for Crohn disease diagnosed 2 years ago, managed with natalizumab for the past year because her intestinal symptoms have become severe and unresponsive to other therapies. On physical examination, there is gait and limb ataxia present. Strength is 4/5 in the right upper limb. A T1/T2 MRI of the brain is ordered and is shown. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options:
A. Sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD)
B. Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD)
C. Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE)
D. Progressive multifocal encephalopathy (PML)
