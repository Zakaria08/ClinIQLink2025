        "content": "rHuEPO was administered to eight patients with chronic renal failure (CRF) and uremia (U) for 1 year. Creatinine Clearance (GFR) averaged 14.3 (9-25) ml/min at an Hct of 28% (26-30). Baseline RBC survival by 51Cr T1/2 was highly correlated with GFR (r = 0.66), p less than 0.05 (2), average 21.6 days. Repeat 51Cr T1/2 at 3 months with GFR 10 ml/min at Hct 38% was prolonged by 7 days to 28.6 (p less than 0.005), and at 1 year remained increased to 28 days (p less than 0.001) with Hct 39%, despite further decreased GFR to less than 4 ml/min and need for dialysis. Reticulocytes varied from 1.6% to 7.4 (3-6 weeks) to 3.1 (3 months) and 1.5% (1 year). Bone marrow cellularity increased from 36% to 47% (3 months) and 44% (1 year). M:E ratio decreased from 3.9:1 to 1.7:1 (3 months) to 1.6:1 (1 year). Marrow iron decreased from 4.1/6 to 2.4/6 (3 months) to 1.8/6 (1 year). Doses of rHuEPO had to be reduced to avoid polycythemia. rHuEPO stimulates erythropoiesis in pts with progressive CRF and U for 1 year. The initial increase in hematocrit is due to the early peak of reticulocytes. At 3 months, rHuEPO maintains the increased hematocrit by three mechanisms: 1) increased reticulocytosis, 2) a trend to increased bone marrow erythroid cellularity, and 3) lengthened RBC survival. At 1 year of rHuEPO therapy, the trend to increased marrow cellularity persists, however, the maintenance of target hematocrit is via a lengthened RBC survival. Despite progression of CRF and U, rHuEPO produced RBCs with longer survival than expected. RBC membranes may have been stabilized by rHuEPO.",

        "content": "We investigated the effects of short term glucocorticoid excess on the gonadotropic and somatotropic axes in healthy men. Subjects (n = 5) underwent blood sampling at 10-min intervals for 6 h before and on days 2, 5, and 8 of glucocorticoid treatment, and for 24 h (n = 6) to examine pulsatile LH and GH release before and during dexamethasone administration (1.5 mg orally twice daily for 1 week). In the time-course study, we found significant decreases on day 8 in serum concentrations of estradiol (from 144 +/- 18 to 99 +/- 18 pmol/L), free testosterone (from 105 +/- 10 to 87 +/- 10 pmol/L), and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (from 6.0 +/- 1.6 to 1.7 +/- 0.3 mumol/L; P less than 0.05). Mean serum LH concentrations did not change (baseline, 5.3 +/- 1.2 IU/L; glucocorticoid, 4.2 +/- 0.61 IU/L). The mean plasma somatomedin-C concentration rose from 0.74 +/- 0.08 to 2.0 +/- 0.35 U/mL (P less than 0.05), and the mean serum GH concentration increased from 1.2 +/- 0.90 micrograms/L (basal) to 4.2 +/- 1.5 micrograms/L (day 8 of dexamethasone; P less than 0.01). Deconvolution analysis of 24-h serum GH and LH concentration profiles revealed that the half-life of endogenous GH and the duration and amplitude (maximal rate of secretion) of computer-resolved GH secretory bursts were not influenced significantly by dexamethasone. The mass of GH secreted per burst rose 1.6-fold. Glucocorticoid treatment also increased detectable GH secretory burst frequency from 12 +/- 1.6 to 18 +/- 1.6 episodes/24 h, decreased the GH interburst interval from 127 +/- 23 to 79 +/- 5 min, and increased the daily GH secretion rate from 41 +/- 11 to 101 +/- 11 micrograms/L.day. These effects on the somatotropic axis were specific, since the half-life of LH; LH secretory burst frequency, amplitude, mass, and duration; and the total daily LH production rate (and LH secretion in response to exogenous GnRH) were not altered by dexamethasone administration. We conclude that short term moderate glucocorticoid excess augments pulsatile GH secretion without influencing the episodic release of LH in normal men.",
