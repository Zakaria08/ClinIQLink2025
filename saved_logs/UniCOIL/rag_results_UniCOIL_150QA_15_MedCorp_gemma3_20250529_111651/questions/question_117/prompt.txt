Document 1 (Title: Cytotoxic and radiosensitizing effects  of hypoxic cell sensitizers on EMT6 mouse mammary tumour cells in vivo and in vitro.): The radiosensitizing activities and toxicities of misonidazole, metronidazole, 2-Methythio-3-nitropyrrole (3NPR), 2-amino-5-nitrothiazole (ANT) and 2,5-dinitroimidazole (KA121) were studied using EMT6 tumour cells and BALB/c KaRw mice. For 10(-4)M concentrations of the drugs, the DMF's for hypoxic cells were: Misonidazole, 1.6; 3NPR, 1.5, ANT, 1.5; KA121, 1.8. The OER was 3.2. In general, the drugs were toxic to hypoxic cells and were not toxic to aerobic cells at 10(-3)M for 24 h. The LD50's in BALB/c KaRw mice were: misonidazole, 1500 mg/kg; 3NPR, 350 mg/kg ANT, 420 mg/kg. In vivo, 1 mg/g misonidazole or metronidazole reduced the terminal slope of the tumour cell survival curve by a factor of 2.2 or 1.6 respectively.

Document 3 (Title: Loop Diuretics -- Administration): The half-life for furosemide is 1.5 to 2 hours but can be up to 2.6 hours in those with renal/hepatic dysfunction or heart failure. Bumetanide has a half-life of 1 hour and can be near 1.3 to 1.6 hours in those with renal/hepatic dysfunction or heart failure. Lastly, torsemide is known to have the longest half-life at 3 to 4 hours and can be as long as 5 to 6 hours in patients with renal/hepatic dysfunction or heart failure. All three loops typically have a similar onset of action. Oral administration between the three averages at 30 to 60 minutes. [6] [2] [7] Torsemide provides the longest duration of action and can give even greater diuretic effects in patients with hepatic dysfunction or heart failure.

Document 5 (Title: One year of rHuEPO therapy prolongs RBC survival and may stabilize RBC membranes despite natural progression of chronic renal failure to uremia and need for dialysis.): rHuEPO was administered to eight patients with chronic renal failure (CRF) and uremia (U) for 1 year. Creatinine Clearance (GFR) averaged 14.3 (9-25) ml/min at an Hct of 28% (26-30). Baseline RBC survival by 51Cr T1/2 was highly correlated with GFR (r = 0.66), p less than 0.05 (2), average 21.6 days. Repeat 51Cr T1/2 at 3 months with GFR 10 ml/min at Hct 38% was prolonged by 7 days to 28.6 (p less than 0.005), and at 1 year remained increased to 28 days (p less than 0.001) with Hct 39%, despite further decreased GFR to less than 4 ml/min and need for dialysis. Reticulocytes varied from 1.6% to 7.4 (3-6 weeks) to 3.1 (3 months) and 1.5% (1 year). Bone marrow cellularity increased from 36% to 47% (3 months) and 44% (1 year). M:E ratio decreased from 3.9:1 to 1.7:1 (3 months) to 1.6:1 (1 year). Marrow iron decreased from 4.1/6 to 2.4/6 (3 months) to 1.8/6 (1 year). Doses of rHuEPO had to be reduced to avoid polycythemia. rHuEPO stimulates erythropoiesis in pts with progressive CRF and U for 1 year. The initial i...
