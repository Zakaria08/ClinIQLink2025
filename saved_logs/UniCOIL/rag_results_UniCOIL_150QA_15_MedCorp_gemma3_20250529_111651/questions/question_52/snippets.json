        "content": "The response of a physico-chemical carcinogen-screening test, the k(e) test, to 46 rodent carcinogens and 20 putative non-carcinogens that had been screened in long-term two-species bioassays by the National Cancer Institute/National Toxicology Program are reported. All of the chemicals screened are those that yield mutagenicity responses in the Ames Salmonella/microsome test that are either equivocal or contrary to the rodent carcinogenicity responses. The electron attachment rate constants, k(e)S, of the test chemicals in cyclohexane at 21 degrees C were measured using a pulse-conductivity technique. The k(e)S of 27 of the 46 rodent carcinogens (59%) are equal or greater than the diffusion-controlled k(e) of carbon tetrachloride, which is regarded as the boundary between a positive and negative response; the k(e)S of 8 of the 20 mutagenic non-carcinogens (40%) are less than diffusion-controlled. If the boundary between positive and negative k(e) responses is decreased to half the diffusion-controlled k(e), six additional carcinogens yield a positive ke response which increases the k(e) test sensitivity to 72% while the specificity to non-carcinogens remains at 40%. Comparison of these k(e)S with measures of the chemicals' electrophilicity that had been inferred from chemical structure indicates that k(e) provides a markedly different measure of electrophilicity and one that complements the Ames Salmonella assay. The use of the k(e) test as an analytical tool to indicate the presence of electron-attaching impurities in solvents such as benzene is discussed, as is the sensitivity of the k(e) test to rodent-liver carcinogens.",

        "content": "Spontaneous and chemically induced revertant colonies were not observed on plates when a strictly anaerobic environment and anaerobically prepared media were used to perform the Ames histidine reversion assay with each of eight different Salmonella strains. A similar effect was observed when the E. coli tryptophan reverse mutation assay was performed under strictly anaerobic conditions. We provide evidence here that under anaerobic conditions growth inhibitor(s) are formed by the S. typhimurium and E. coli bacteria when the limited histidine and tryptophan, respectively, are depleted from the medium. The inhibitor(s) are nonspecific and inhibit the growth not only of prototrophic bacteria but also of the inhibitor-producing bacteria as measured by neutralized supernatants of growth-limiting minimal liquid cultures. Inhibitor(s) are also formed in stationary phase cultures of Salmonella and E. coli in minimal liquid medium supplemented with excess histidine and tryptophan, respectively. These results suggest that inhibitor formation under anaerobic conditions is a physiological phenomenon which interferes with at least two reverse mutation assays. Whether or not it also interferes with the reverse mutagenesis process remains to be determined.",
        "contents": "Evidence that inhibitor(s) are formed which may interfere with the growth of revertant colonies in the Ames Salmonella and the E. coli tryptophan reverse mutation assays when strictly anaerobic conditions are used. Spontaneous and chemically induced revertant colonies were not observed on plates when a strictly anaerobic environment and anaerobically prepared media were used to perform the Ames histidine reversion assay with each of eight different Salmonella strains. A similar effect was observed when the E. coli tryptophan reverse mutation assay was performed under strictly anaerobic conditions. We provide evidence here that under anaerobic conditions growth inhibitor(s) are formed by the S. typhimurium and E. coli bacteria when the limited histidine and tryptophan, respectively, are depleted from the medium. The inhibitor(s) are nonspecific and inhibit the growth not only of prototrophic bacteria but also of the inhibitor-producing bacteria as measured by neutralized supernatants of growth-limiting minimal liquid cultures. Inhibitor(s) are also formed in stationary phase cultures of Salmonella and E. coli in minimal liquid medium supplemented with excess histidine and tryptophan, respectively. These results suggest that inhibitor formation under anaerobic conditions is a physiological phenomenon which interferes with at least two reverse mutation assays. Whether or not it also interferes with the reverse mutagenesis process remains to be determined.",

        "title": "Irregular nocturnal breathing patterns high altitude in subjects susceptible to high-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE): a preliminary study.",
        "content": "We studied nocturnal breathing patterns and symptoms of acute mountain sickness (AMS) during trekking in the Japanese Alps (altitude: 2,760-2,920 m) for 4 d in five subjects susceptible to high-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE-S-S) and five control volunteers. Breathing patterns were evaluated with the impedance plethysmograph, and symptoms of AMS were evaluated by the environmental symptoms questionnaire-III score for AMS of cerebral type (AMS-C score). In both groups, the percentage of time with periodic breathing significantly increased at high altitude and the percentage in controls was significantly higher than in HAPE-S-S on the second night. In four HAPE-S-S, other disordered breathing patterns, termed \"irregular breathing,\" were observed frequently by night at high altitude. Irregular breathing patterns were characterized by irregularly repeated oscillatory or nonoscillatory clusters of breaths with augmented tidal volume, followed by expiratory pause, apnea, or hypoventilation of various durations. All controls did not show significant changes in AMS-C score, but four HAPE-S-S showed the increase in AMS-C score on the next morning after frequent irregular nocturnal breathing. There was significant correlation between the percentage of time with irregular nocturnal breathing and AMS-C score on the next morning. These results suggest that HAPE-S-S are prone to irregular nocturnal breathing patterns at high altitude, which is associated with the development of AMS, but it was not possible to determine whether these abnormal breathing patterns are a cause or an effect of AMS.",
