        "content": "The effect of tumor bulk resection on survival was studied in 102 patients with stages II and III ovarian cancer. A multiple linear regression equation provuded both simultenaous control of multiple confounding variables and an assessment of these variables as independent predictors of survival. The most important factors were the histologic grade of the tumor and the size of the largest residual tumor mass after operation. Survival time was uniformly poor if the diameter of the largest residual tumor mass exceeded 1.5 cm irrespective of total tumor volume (mean=12.7 months, SE=1.6 mo). Survival time was inversely proportional to residual mass size under 1.6 cm, and surgery improved survival relative to reduction in mass size below this limit. Extensive resections of tumor bulk with failure to remove all masses greater than 1.5 cm in diameter did not influence survival. Surgery provides optimum benefit when all gross tumor can be excised safely.",

Heterozygous mice were normal, but homozygous mice died at birth from anoxia and had numerous defects that were centered at the level of rhombomeres 4 to 7 and included delayed hindbrain neural tube closure, absence of certain cranial nerves and ganglia, and malformed inner ears and bones of the skull. Thus, Hox-1.6 is involved in regional specification along the rostrocaudal axis, but only in its most rostral domain of expression. Hox-1.6 appears to specify neurogenic neural crest cells prior to specification of mesenchymal neural crest cells by Hox-1.5. Thus, within the same region of the presumptive hindbrain, two HOX-1 genes are involved in the patterning of two different populations of neural crest cells.

        "content": "The incidence of cancer was studied in a population-based cohort of 9,353 individuals (8,340 men and 1,013 women) with a discharge diagnosis of alcoholism in 1965-83, followed up for 19 years (mean 7.7). After exclusion of cancers in the first year of follow-up, 491 cancers were observed cf 343.2 expected through 1984 (standardized incidence ratio [SIR] = 1.4, 95 percent confidence interval [CI] = 1.3-1.6). A similar excess risk of cancer was seen among men (SIR = 1.4, CI = 1.3-1.6) and among women (SIR = 1.5, CI = 1.1-2.0). We observed the established associations with cancers of the oral cavity and pharynx (SIR = 4.1, CI = 2.9-5.7), esophagus (SIR = 6.8, CI = 4.5-9.9), larynx (SIR = 3.3, CI = 1.7-6.0), and lung (SIR = 2.1, CI = 1.7-2.6), although confounding by smoking likely increased these risk estimates. While there was evidence of increased risk for pancreatic cancer (SIR = 1.5, CI = 0.9-2.3), alcoholism did not elevate the incidence of cancer of the stomach (SIR = 0.9, CI = 6-1.4), large bowel (SIR = 1.1, CI = 0.8-1.5), prostate (SIR = 1.0, CI = 0.8-1.3), urinary bladder (SIR = 1.0, CI = 0.6-1.5), or of malignant melanoma (SIR = 0.9, CI = 0.3-1.9). Among women, the number of breast cancers observed was close to expected (SIR = 1.2, CI = 0.6-2.2), although a significant excess number of cervical cancers occurred (SIR = 4.2, CI = 1.5-9.1).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
