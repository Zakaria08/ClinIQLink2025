        "content": "The enzyme 3-methylaspartate ammonia-lyase (EC 4.3.1.2) catalyzes the exchange of the C-3 hydrogen of the substrate, (2S,3S)-3-methylaspartic acid, with solvent hydrogen. The mechanism of the exchange reaction was probed using (2S,3S)-3-methylaspartic acid and its C-3-deuteriated isotopomer. Incubations conducted in tritiated water allowed the rate of protium or deuterium wash-out from the substrates to be measured as tritium wash-in. The primary deuterium isotope effects for the exchange under essentially Vmax conditions ( [S] much greater than Km) were 1.6, 1.5, and 1.5 at pH 9.0, 7.6, and 6.5. The deamination reaction, measured spectrophotometrically on the same incubations, showed isotope effects of 1.7, 1.6, and 1.4 at pH 9.0, 7.6, and 6.5, in agreement with the values of DV and D(V/K) reported previously [Botting, N.P., Akhtar, M., Cohen, M.A., &amp; Gani, D. (1988) Biochemistry 27, 2956-2959]. The ratio of the rate of exchange to the rate of deamination, however, varied widely with pH. Together with the identical values of the primary isotope effects for the two reactions, this result indicates that the partition between reaction pathways occurs after the slowest steps in the common part of the reaction coordinate pathway, almost certainly after the cleavage of the C-N bond at the level of the enzyme-ammonia-mesaconic acid complex, and not at the putative carbanion level as was previously suggested. The enzyme requires both K+ and Mg2+ ions for activity, although ammonium ion is also able to bind in the K+ site and act as an activator. Variation of the metal ion concentration alters the magnitude of the primary deuterium isotope effects. The variation of potassium ion concentration causes the most marked changes: at 1.6 mM K+, DV and D(V/K) are 1.7, whereas at 50 mM K+, DV and D(V/K) are reduced to 1.0. The isotope effects are also reduced at low K+ concentration due to the emergence of a slow-acting high K+ affinity monopotassium form of the enzyme. The binding order and role of the metal ion cofactors and their influence in determining the formal mechanism of the reaction is discussed, and the failure of previous workers to observe primary deuterium isotope effects for the deamination process is explained. The product desorption order was tested by product inhibition, alternative product inhibition, and isotope exchange experiments. Ammonia and mesaconic acid debind in a random fashion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

        "title": "Regulation of purine synthesis de novo in human fibroblasts by purine nucleotides and phosphoribosylpyrophosphate.",
        "content": "Previous studies of purine nucleotide synthesis de novo have suggested that major regulation of the rate of the pathway is affected at either the phosphoribosylpyrophosphate (PP-Rib-P) synthetase reaction or the amidophosphoribosyltransferase (amido PRT) reaction, or both. We studied control of purine synthesis de novo in cultured normal, hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT)-deficient, and PP-Rib-P synthetase-superactive human fibroblasts by measuring concentrations and rates of synthesis of PP-Rib-P and purine nucleotide end products, proposed effectors of regulation, during inhibition of the pathway. Incubation of cells for 90 min with 0.1 mM azaserine, a glutamine antagonist which specifically blocked the pathway at the level of conversion of formylglycinamide ribotide, resulted in a 5-16% decrease in purine nucleoside triphosphate concentrations but no consistent alteration in generation of PP-Rib-P. During this treatment, however, rates of the early steps of the pathway were increased slightly (9-15%) in normal and HGPRT-deficient strains, more markedly (32-60%) in cells with catalytically superactive PP-Rib-P synthetases, and not at all in fibroblasts with purine nucleotide feedback-resistant PP-Rib-P synthetases. In contrast, glutamine deprivation, which inhibited the pathway at the amido PRT reaction, resulted in time-dependent nucleoside triphosphate pool depletion (26-43% decrease at 24 h) accompanied by increased rates of PP-Rib-P generation and, upon readdition of glutamine, substantial increments in rates of purine synthesis de novo. Enhanced PP-Rib-P generation during glutamine deprivation was greatest in cells with regulatory defects in PP-Rib-P synthetase (2-fold), but purine synthesis in these cells was stimulated only 1.4-fold control rates by glutamine readdition. Stimulation of these processes in normal and HGPRT-deficient cells and in cells with PP-Rib-P synthetase catalytic defects was, respectively: 1.5 and 2.0-fold; 1.5 and 1.7-fold; and 1.6 and 4.1-fold. These studies support the following concepts. 1) Rates of purine synthesis de novo are regulated at both the PP-Rib-P synthetase and amido PRT reactions by end products, with the latter reaction more sensitive to small changes in purine nucleotide inhibitor concentrations. 2) PP-Rib-P exerts its role as a major regulator of purine synthetic rate by virtue of its interaction with nucleotide inhibitors to determine the activity of amido PRT. 3) Activation of amido PRT by PP-Rib-P is nearly maximal at base line in fibroblasts with regulatory defects in PP-Rib-P synthetase.",

Subjects (n = 5) underwent blood sampling at 10-min intervals for 6 h before and on days 2, 5, and 8 of glucocorticoid treatment, and for 24 h (n = 6) to examine pulsatile LH and GH release before and during dexamethasone administration (1.5 mg orally twice daily for 1 week). In the time-course study, we found significant decreases on day 8 in serum concentrations of estradiol (from 144 +/- 18 to 99 +/- 18 pmol/L), free testosterone (from 105 +/- 10 to 87 +/- 10 pmol/L), and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (from 6.0 +/- 1.6 to 1.7 +/- 0.3 mumol/L; P less than 0.05). Mean serum LH concentrations did not change (baseline, 5.3 +/- 1.2 IU/L; glucocorticoid, 4.2 +/- 0.61 IU/L). The mean plasma somatomedin-C concentration rose from 0.74 +/- 0.08 to 2.0 +/- 0.35 U/mL (P less than 0.05), and the mean serum GH concentration increased from 1.2 +/- 0.90 micrograms/L (basal) to 4.2 +/- 1.5 micrograms/L (day 8 of dexamethasone; P less than 0.01). Deconvolution analysis of 24-h serum GH and LH concentration profiles revealed that the half-life of endogenous GH and the duration and amplitude (maximal rate of secretion) of computer-resolved GH secretory bursts were not influenced significantly by dexamethasone. The mass of GH secreted per burst rose 1.6-fold. Glucocorticoid treatment also increased detectable GH secretory burst frequency from 12 +/- 1.6 to 18 +/- 1.6 episodes/24 h, decreased the GH interburst interval from 127 +/- 23 to 79 +/- 5 min, and increased the daily GH secretion rate from 41 +/- 11 to 101 +/- 11 micrograms/L.day. These effects on the somatotropic axis were specific, since the half-life of LH; LH secretory burst frequency, amplitude, mass, and duration; and the total daily LH production rate (and LH secretion in response to exogenous GnRH) were not altered by dexamethasone administration. We conclude that short term moderate glucocorticoid excess augments pulsatile GH secretion without influencing the episodic release of LH in normal men.",
