Document 1 (Title: Arterial Blood Gas -- Clinical Significance): Another parameter commonly used in ICUs to assess oxygenation is the oxygenation index (OI). This index is considered a better indicator of lung injury, particularly in the neonatal and pediatric population, compared to the P/F ratio. This index also includes the level of invasive ventilatory support required to maintain oxygenation. [33] The OI is the product of the mean airway pressure (Paw) in cm H 2 O, measured by the ventilator, and the FiO 2 is the percentage divided by the PaO 2 . The OI is commonly used to guide management, such as initiating inhaled nitric oxide, administering surfactant, and defining the potential need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. [34]
Document 2 (Title: Hypoxia-induced alterations of norepinephrine vascular reactivity in isolated perfused cat lung.): Past work in the isolated perfused cat lung has shown that acute hypoxia (H) changes the response to norepinephrine (NE) from vasoconstriction to vasodilation but has no effect on the response to serotonin (S). These results could be related to the increase in pulmonary arterial pressure or vascular resistance during the hypoxic pressor response or a direct effect of H. We addressed this question, in the same preparation, by comparing responses to NE under four conditions in each experimental animal (n = 12): 1) NE infused during normoxia; 2) NE infused after vascular resistance (Rpv) was increased with serotonin; 3) NE infused after Rpv was increased by H; 4) NE infused after lobar pressure was raised by an increase in flow (P/F). PO2 values during H were varied (27-56 Torr). S and H produced a 137 +/- 35 and 43 +/- 8% delta Rpv increase in lobar vascular resistance, respectively. P/F increased lobar pressure 91 +/- 10%. Only NE infusion during H demonstrated significant differences in lobar pressure and Rpv...

Document 4 (Title: Oxygen therapy): Oxygen therapy, also known as supplemental oxygen, is the use of oxygen as medical treatment. Acute indications for therapy include hypoxemia (low blood oxygen levels), carbon monoxide toxicity and cluster headache. It may also be prophylactically given to maintain blood oxygen levels during the induction of anesthesia. Oxygen therapy is often useful in chronic hypoxemia caused by conditions such as severe COPD or cystic fibrosis. Oxygen can be delivered via nasal cannula or face mask, or via high pressure conditions such as in endotracheal intubation or hyperbaric chamber. It can also be given through bypassing the airway, such as in ECMO therapy.
Document 5 (Title: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis): Oxygen therapy In the 2011 IPF guidelines, oxygen therapy, or supplementary oxygen for home use, became a strong recommendation for use in those patients with significantly low oxygen levels at rest. Although oxygen therapy has not been shown to improve survival in IPF, some data indicate an improvement in exercise capacity.
