        "content": "To describe the incidence of lower extremity amputations and sores or ulcers and investigate risk factors for these complications. Cohort. Primary care. Population-based sample (N = 1210) of younger-onset diabetic persons (diagnosed before age 30 years and taking insulin) and a stratified random sample (N = 1780) of older-onset diabetic persons (diagnosed after age 30 years). Baseline and 4-year follow-up examinations were completed by 996 and 891 younger-onset persons, respectively, and by 1370 and 987 older-onset persons, respectively. Amputations and sores or ulcers of the lower extremities. Four-year incidence of amputations was 2.2% in both groups. Incidence of sores or ulcers was 9.5% in younger-onset and 10.5% in older-onset persons. In younger-onset persons, significant risk factors for amputation with odds ratios (and 95% confidence intervals) include age, 2.0 for 10 years (1.2 to 3.1), history of sores or ulcers, 10.5 (3.7 to 29.8), diastolic blood pressure, 2.1 for 10 mm Hg (1.3 to 3.5), and pack-years smoked, 1.3 for 10 years (1.0 to 1.6). Risk factors for sores or ulcers include glycosylated hemoglobin, 1.6 for 2% (1.3 to 2.0), retinopathy, 1.3 for two steps (1.1 to 1.6), and current smoking, 2.3 (1.0 to 5.6). In older-onset persons, risk factors for amputation are history of sores or ulcers, 4.6 (1.7 to 12.2), proteinuria, 4.3 (1.6 to 11.5), glycosylated hemoglobin, 1.5 for 2% (1.0 to 2.2), sex, 2.8 for males (1.0 to 7.5), and duration of diabetes, 1.8 for 10 years (1.0 to 3.2). For sores or ulcers, risk factors are glycosylated hemoglobin, 1.6 for 2% (1.3 to 2.0), duration, 1.5 for 10 years (1.0 to 2.1), proteinuria, 2.2 (1.1 to 4.3), and diastolic blood pressure, 0.8 for 10 mm Hg (0.6 to 1.0). Several factors offer potential for modification for the prevention of amputations but require further study. These include blood pressure, glycosylated hemoglobin, and smoking.",

        "content": "In order to explore the genetic risk of a child with a family history of allergies developing asthma, allergic rhinitis, or atopic dermatitis, questionnaires filled in by 6665 families were analysed. The data were collected in a population based cross sectional survey of 9-11 year old schoolchildren living in Munich and southern Bavaria. The relation between asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis and the number of allergic first degree relatives, and the type of allergic disease was examined. Analyses were done separately for families with single or multiple allergic diseases. In families with one allergic parent the risk of the child developing asthma was increased by asthma in a parent, with an odds ratio (OR) of 2.6 (95% confidence interval 1.7 to 4.0) but not by parental allergic rhinitis with OR 1.0 (0.7 to 1.5) or atopic dermatitis, OR 1.0 (0.6 to 1.6). For allergic rhinitis the highest risk with OR 3.6 (2.9 to 4.6) was observed with allergic rhinitis of one parent, apparently lower for asthma of one parent, OR 2.5 (1.6 to 4.0) or atopic dermatitis, OR 1.7 (1.1 to 2.5). Children with parental atopic dermatitis had a high risk for atopic dermatitis, OR 3.4 (2.6 to 4.4), compared with children with parental asthma, OR 1.5 (1.0 to 2.2), or parental allergic rhinitis, OR 1.4 (1.1 to 1.8). Risk factors in families with combined allergies of two relatives (parents and siblings) were analysed separately for the different combinations. These results support the hypothesis that asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis are multifactorial diseases brought about by various familial and environmental influences.",
