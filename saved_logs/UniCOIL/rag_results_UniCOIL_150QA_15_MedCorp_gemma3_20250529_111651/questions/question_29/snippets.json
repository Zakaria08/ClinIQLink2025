Population-based sample (N = 1210) of younger-onset diabetic persons (diagnosed before age 30 years and taking insulin) and a stratified random sample (N = 1780) of older-onset diabetic persons (diagnosed after age 30 years). Baseline and 4-year follow-up examinations were completed by 996 and 891 younger-onset persons, respectively, and by 1370 and 987 older-onset persons, respectively. Amputations and sores or ulcers of the lower extremities. Four-year incidence of amputations was 2.2% in both groups. Incidence of sores or ulcers was 9.5% in younger-onset and 10.5% in older-onset persons. In younger-onset persons, significant risk factors for amputation with odds ratios (and 95% confidence intervals) include age, 2.0 for 10 years (1.2 to 3.1), history of sores or ulcers, 10.5 (3.7 to 29.8), diastolic blood pressure, 2.1 for 10 mm Hg (1.3 to 3.5), and pack-years smoked, 1.3 for 10 years (1.0 to 1.6). Risk factors for sores or ulcers include glycosylated hemoglobin, 1.6 for 2% (1.3 to 2.0), retinopathy, 1.3 for two steps (1.1 to 1.6), and current smoking, 2.3 (1.0 to 5.6). In older-onset persons, risk factors for amputation are history of sores or ulcers, 4.6 (1.7 to 12.2), proteinuria, 4.3 (1.6 to 11.5), glycosylated hemoglobin, 1.5 for 2% (1.0 to 2.2), sex, 2.8 for males (1.0 to 7.5), and duration of diabetes, 1.8 for 10 years (1.0 to 3.2). For sores or ulcers, risk factors are glycosylated hemoglobin, 1.6 for 2% (1.3 to 2.0), duration, 1.5 for 10 years (1.0 to 2.1), proteinuria, 2.2 (1.1 to 4.3), and diastolic blood pressure, 0.8 for 10 mm Hg (0.6 to 1.0). Several factors offer potential for modification for the prevention of amputations but require further study. These include blood pressure, glycosylated hemoglobin, and smoking.",

        "content": "The possible influence of small pulmonary artery size on the results following complete repair of tetralogy of Fallot has not been investigated in patients less than 1 year of age. We, therefore, reviewed our recent experience with infant repair to assess this. Between January 87 and October 90, repair was performed in 58 infants less than 1 year old (median, 6 months) with tetralogy of Fallot and pulmonary stenosis (n = 53) or pulmonary atresia without important aortopulmonary collaterals (n = 5). The McGoon ratio (diameter of the right pulmonary artery at the prebranching point plus that of the left divided by the diameter of the aorta at the diaphragm) by cineangiography (n = 48) was between 1.2 and 1.5 in 15 patients, 1.6 and 2.0 in 20, and greater than 2.0 in 13. Transannular patching was performed in 19 of the patients with pulmonary stenosis (36%). Muscle resection was avoided in 29 infants and was minimal in the remaining 29. A weak correlation, with considerable scatter, was found between the McGoon ratio and postrepair right ventricular/left ventricular pressure measured in the operating room (r = 0.4), and the relations were similar to those previously reported for children. Right ventricular/left ventricular pressure was 0.55 +/- 0.03 in infants with McGoon ratios of 1.2-1.5, 0.46 +/- 0.03 with ratios of 1.6-2.0, and 0.47 +/- 0.03 with ratios greater than 2.0 (p = 0.01).

        "contents": "Repair of tetralogy of Fallot in infancy. Effect of pulmonary artery size on outcome. The possible influence of small pulmonary artery size on the results following complete repair of tetralogy of Fallot has not been investigated in patients less than 1 year of age. We, therefore, reviewed our recent experience with infant repair to assess this. Between January 87 and October 90, repair was performed in 58 infants less than 1 year old (median, 6 months) with tetralogy of Fallot and pulmonary stenosis (n = 53) or pulmonary atresia without important aortopulmonary collaterals (n = 5). The McGoon ratio (diameter of the right pulmonary artery at the prebranching point plus that of the left divided by the diameter of the aorta at the diaphragm) by cineangiography (n = 48) was between 1.2 and 1.5 in 15 patients, 1.6 and 2.0 in 20, and greater than 2.0 in 13. Transannular patching was performed in 19 of the patients with pulmonary stenosis (36%). Muscle resection was avoided in 29 infants and was minimal in the remaining 29. A weak correlation, with considerable scatter, was found between the McGoon ratio and postrepair right ventricular/left ventricular pressure measured in the operating room (r = 0.4), and the relations were similar to those previously reported for children.

She had undergone subtotal removal of the right orbital tumor (adenoid cystic carcinoma) by frontal craniotomy, followed by radiation therapy (64Gy). She had been quite well until she noticed a gradual loss of vision in her right eye 18 months later. Her visual acuity was 0.2 in the right eye and 1.5 in the left eye with right relative afferent pupillary defect and dense central scotoma. Funduscopy revealed optic disc swelling with surrounding retinal edema and small hemorrhage in the right eye. Fluorescein angiography revealed a hypoperfusion area and obstruction of the small retinal vessels in the posterior pole, but this was not large enough to explain the dense central scotoma. Although prednisolone therapy gave temporary improvement, the visual function gradually deteriorated.",

        "content": "The enzyme 3-methylaspartate ammonia-lyase (EC 4.3.1.2) catalyzes the exchange of the C-3 hydrogen of the substrate, (2S,3S)-3-methylaspartic acid, with solvent hydrogen. The mechanism of the exchange reaction was probed using (2S,3S)-3-methylaspartic acid and its C-3-deuteriated isotopomer. Incubations conducted in tritiated water allowed the rate of protium or deuterium wash-out from the substrates to be measured as tritium wash-in. The primary deuterium isotope effects for the exchange under essentially Vmax conditions ( [S] much greater than Km) were 1.6, 1.5, and 1.5 at pH 9.0, 7.6, and 6.5. The deamination reaction, measured spectrophotometrically on the same incubations, showed isotope effects of 1.7, 1.6, and 1.4 at pH 9.0, 7.6, and 6.5, in agreement with the values of DV and D(V/K) reported previously [Botting, N.P., Akhtar, M., Cohen, M.A., &amp; Gani, D. (1988) Biochemistry 27, 2956-2959]. The ratio of the rate of exchange to the rate of deamination, however, varied widely with pH. Together with the identical values of the primary isotope effects for the two reactions, this result indicates that the partition between reaction pathways occurs after the slowest steps in the common part of the reaction coordinate pathway, almost certainly after the cleavage of the C-N bond at the level of the enzyme-ammonia-mesaconic acid complex, and not at the putative carbanion level as was previously suggested. The enzyme requires both K+ and Mg2+ ions for activity, although ammonium ion is also able to bind in the K+ site and act as an activator. Variation of the metal ion concentration alters the magnitude of the primary deuterium isotope effects. The variation of potassium ion concentration causes the most marked changes: at 1.6 mM K+, DV and D(V/K) are 1.7, whereas at 50 mM K+, DV and D(V/K) are reduced to 1.0. The isotope effects are also reduced at low K+ concentration due to the emergence of a slow-acting high K+ affinity monopotassium form of the enzyme. The binding order and role of the metal ion cofactors and their influence in determining the formal mechanism of the reaction is discussed, and the failure of previous workers to observe primary deuterium isotope effects for the deamination process is explained. The product desorption order was tested by product inhibition, alternative product inhibition, and isotope exchange experiments.
