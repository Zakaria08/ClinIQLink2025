Document 1 (Title: The prevalence and incidence of lower extremity amputation in a diabetic population.): To describe the incidence of lower extremity amputations and sores or ulcers and investigate risk factors for these complications. Cohort. Primary care. Population-based sample (N = 1210) of younger-onset diabetic persons (diagnosed before age 30 years and taking insulin) and a stratified random sample (N = 1780) of older-onset diabetic persons (diagnosed after age 30 years). Baseline and 4-year follow-up examinations were completed by 996 and 891 younger-onset persons, respectively, and by 1370 and 987 older-onset persons, respectively. Amputations and sores or ulcers of the lower extremities. Four-year incidence of amputations was 2.2% in both groups. Incidence of sores or ulcers was 9.5% in younger-onset and 10.5% in older-onset persons. In younger-onset persons, significant risk factors for amputation with odds ratios (and 95% confidence intervals) include age, 2.0 for 10 years (1.2 to 3.1), history of sores or ulcers, 10.5 (3.7 to 29.8), diastolic blood pressure, 2.1 for 10 mm Hg (1.3 to 3.5), and pack-y...

Question: A 63-year-old woman presents to her primary-care doctor for a 2-month history of vision changes, specifically citing the gradual onset of double vision. Her double vision is present all the time and does not get better or worse throughout the day. She has also noticed that she has a hard time keeping her right eye open, and her right eyelid looks 'droopy' in the mirror. Physical exam findings during primary gaze are shown in the photo. Her right pupil is 6 mm and poorly reactive to light. The rest of her neurologic exam is unremarkable. Laboratory studies show an Hb A1c of 5.0%. Which of the following is the next best test for this patient?
Options:
A. Direct fundoscopy
B. Intraocular pressures
C. MR angiography of the head
D. Temporal artery biopsy
