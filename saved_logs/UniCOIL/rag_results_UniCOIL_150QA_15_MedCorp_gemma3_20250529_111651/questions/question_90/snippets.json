Nine controlled trials of evening primrose oil were performed in eight centres. Four of the trials were parallel and five cross-over. Doctors and patients assessed the severity of eczema by scoring measures of inflammation, dryness, scaliness, pruritus and overall skin involvement. Individual symptom scores were combined to give a single global score at each assessment point. In the analysis of the parallel studies, both patient and doctor scores showed a highly significant improvement over baseline (P less than 0.0001) due to Epogam: for both scores the effect of Epogam was significantly better than placebo. Similar results were obtained on analysis of the cross-over trials, but in this case the difference between Epogam and placebo in the doctors' global score, although in favour of Epogam, failed to reach significance. The effects on itch were particularly striking. There was no placebo response to this symptom, whereas there was a substantial and highly significant response to Epogam (P less than 0.0001). When the improvements, or otherwise, in clinical condition were related to changes in plasma levels of dihomogammalinolenic and arachidoni acids, it was found that there was a positive correlation between an improvement in clinical score and a rise in the fatty acid levels.",

        "title": "Liver trauma in a major peripheral hospital: analysis of management and mortality in 74 patients.",
        "content": "The management of liver trauma has improved considerably over the past 2 decades. However, much of the evidence for this improvement has emanated from major trauma centres. Little information is available from peripheral hospitals which deal with much of the trauma seen in Australia. This study set out to examine the management of liver trauma in Box Hill Hospital over the past 2 decades; 74 patients were treated for liver trauma during 1967-86, and the factors considered contributory to mortality rate were analysed. The overall mortality rate was 33.8%, but each 5-year period saw a reduction in mortality rate (25% in the 1982-86 period). The patient's age, associated injuries, transfusion requirements, degree of liver injury and postoperative haemorrhage all contributed to a higher mortality rate. This study indicated that management of liver trauma in a peripheral hospital results in mortality rates that are comparable with major trauma centres. Moreover, by highlighting treatment deficiencies through self-audit, improved treatment protocols should further enhance survival prospects.",
