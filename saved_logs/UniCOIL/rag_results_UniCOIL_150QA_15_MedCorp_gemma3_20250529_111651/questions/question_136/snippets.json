        "content": "The specific bindings of [3H]flunitrazepam [( 3H]FLU), [3H]CGS 8216, and t-[35S]butylbicyclophosphorothionate [( 35S]TBPS) to sites on rat cerebellar granule cells all increase from 4 to 15 days in culture, although their time courses differ. Specific [3H]FLU binding doubles, [3H]CGS 8216 binding triples, and [35S]TBPS binding increases about fourfold from 4 to 15 days in culture. Displacement studies, using the type I-selective ligand CL 218,872, indicate that at 4 days the [3H]FLU binding sites are almost entirely \"type II,\" judging from an IC50 value near 300 nM and a pseudo-Hill number near 1. By 10 days, approximately equal numbers of type I and type II binding sites are present in the cultured cells, and this ratio remains constant thereafter (12 and 15 days). At days 10-15, both the IC50 value for CL 218,872 (near 100 nM) and the pseudo-Hill number (near 0.7) remain constant and are significantly different from the values at culture day 4. The development of specific [35S]TBPS binding parallels that of [3H]CGS 8216 binding more closely than the development of [3H]FLU binding. The [3H]CGS 8216/[3H]FLU ratio increased by a factor of 1.6 from day 4 to day 15 (p less than 0.001). Taken together, our data suggest the existence of several gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABAA) receptor subunits, the relative proportions of which change during development. The presence of the GABA-mimetic 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo[5,4c]pyridine-3-ol (THIP) in the culture medium had no apparent effect on any of the binding sites studied, although THIP was shown previously to induce low-affinity GABA binding sites.",

The mechanism of the exchange reaction was probed using (2S,3S)-3-methylaspartic acid and its C-3-deuteriated isotopomer. Incubations conducted in tritiated water allowed the rate of protium or deuterium wash-out from the substrates to be measured as tritium wash-in. The primary deuterium isotope effects for the exchange under essentially Vmax conditions ( [S] much greater than Km) were 1.6, 1.5, and 1.5 at pH 9.0, 7.6, and 6.5. The deamination reaction, measured spectrophotometrically on the same incubations, showed isotope effects of 1.7, 1.6, and 1.4 at pH 9.0, 7.6, and 6.5, in agreement with the values of DV and D(V/K) reported previously [Botting, N.P., Akhtar, M., Cohen, M.A., &amp; Gani, D. (1988) Biochemistry 27, 2956-2959]. The ratio of the rate of exchange to the rate of deamination, however, varied widely with pH. Together with the identical values of the primary isotope effects for the two reactions, this result indicates that the partition between reaction pathways occurs after the slowest steps in the common part of the reaction coordinate pathway, almost certainly after the cleavage of the C-N bond at the level of the enzyme-ammonia-mesaconic acid complex, and not at the putative carbanion level as was previously suggested. The enzyme requires both K+ and Mg2+ ions for activity, although ammonium ion is also able to bind in the K+ site and act as an activator. Variation of the metal ion concentration alters the magnitude of the primary deuterium isotope effects. The variation of potassium ion concentration causes the most marked changes: at 1.6 mM K+, DV and D(V/K) are 1.7, whereas at 50 mM K+, DV and D(V/K) are reduced to 1.0. The isotope effects are also reduced at low K+ concentration due to the emergence of a slow-acting high K+ affinity monopotassium form of the enzyme. The binding order and role of the metal ion cofactors and their influence in determining the formal mechanism of the reaction is discussed, and the failure of previous workers to observe primary deuterium isotope effects for the deamination process is explained.
