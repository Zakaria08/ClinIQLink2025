All anal vibrators have one common feature: they produce a vibrating effect in the rectum for pleasurable sensations. Anal vibrators differ from other types of vibrators in that they have a flared base to prevent possible loss in the rectum. The average size of an anal vibrator is smaller than vibrators intended for vaginal penetration and may vary from 4-6 inches long and about 1 inch wide. As well as other vibrators designed for external and internal stimulation, anal vibrators are usually battery operated: the batteries may be inside the unit or connected by wire to a power pack. Unlike anal dildos, such as butt plugs, anal probes and anal beads, vibrating anal toys may produce various stimulating effects: rotating, vibrating or pulsating, and can have different speed or vibration levels to regulate and adjust the vibrator to various sensations.",

Seven parameters of anal function were measured. Intraindividual variation of the parameters was studied in 5 females and 5 males. The results of dynamic anal manometry were compared with standard pull-through static anal manometry and correlated well. During opening of the anal sphincter at rest, compliance increased with increasing distension. Males had higher maximal closing pressures during squeeze and lower anal compliance during squeeze than females. There was no sex differences of the sphincter measurements at rest. Age had little effect, and gender had no effect on the measurements. With standard anal manometry, 6 of 23 patients with fecal incontinence both had maximal resting pressure and maximal squeeze pressure within the normal range. When dynamic anal manometry was used, all 23 patients showed one or more abnormal values.
