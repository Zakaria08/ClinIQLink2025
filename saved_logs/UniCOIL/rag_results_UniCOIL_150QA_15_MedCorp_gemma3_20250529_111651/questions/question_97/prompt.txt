Document 1 (Title: Middle Cerebral Artery Stroke -- Continuing Education Activity): Objectives: Identify the various potential etiologies of middle cerebral artery stroke. Summarize the most important evaluations needed to diagnose a middle cerebral artery stroke. Outline the differential diagnoses that must be considered if a patient presents with stroke-like symptoms but does not have a stroke. Review how to address the modifiable risk factors for secondary stroke prevention after a stroke, and how the interprofessional team can be involved in improving the outcome and quality of life of a stroke patient.

Document 2 (Title: rCBF-SPECT in brain infarction: when does it predict outcome?): We prospectively studied 26 patients with ischemic stroke within 24 hr, after 2 wk, and after 6 mo with thallium-201-diethyldithiocarbamate single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and neurologic and functional assessments. The admission flow deficits correlated with outcome. The admission and 6-mo scores correlated with clinical conditions at each time. At 2 wk, the flow deficits were smaller and did not correlate with clinical parameters. Nor did the presence or absence of hyperfixation of the radiopharmaceutical. Six months after the infarct, the flow defect had decreased in 9 of 15 patients in whom three serial scans were available, with better clinical improvement than in the remaining six whose flow deficits increased. More patients in the first group had been treated randomly with the calcium-entry blocker flunarizine. SPECT imaging of rCBF within 24 hr after stroke correlates with clinical outcome and condition, whereas rCBF imaging at 2 wk after the stroke shows no clinical correlation.
Document 3 (Title: Thrombosis): reperfusion in acute ischemic conditions to improve clinical outcomes. Therapeutic strategies that have potential to improve clinical outcomes in reperfused STEMI patients include remote ischemic conditioning (RIC), exenatide, and metoprolol. These have emerged amongst a multitude of cardioprotective interventions investigated with largely neutral clinical data. Of these, RIC has the most robust clinical evidence, especially in the context of STEMI, but also emerging for other indications such as acute ischemic stroke and aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Document 4 (Title: Haemodilution in acute stroke: results of the Italian haemodilution trial. Italian Acute Stroke Study Group.): In a multicentre clinical trial 1267 patients with hemispheric stroke of duration 12 h or less and haematocrit of 35% or more were prospectively randomised to either haemodilution (by venesection and replacement of the same volume of dextran 40 in saline solution) or control treatment groups. In the haemodiluted group mean haematocrit declined from 43% to 37% at 48 h and this fall was maintained for seven days. A plain computed tomographic scan was obtained in all but 37 patients. 87% of the strokes were infarcts and 13% were haemorrhages. After six months the numbers of dead or severely disabled patients were equally distributed in the two treatment groups, and this was true also within the ischaemic and haemorrhagic subgroups. Furthermore, haemodilution did not improve outcome either in the group with very recent ischaemic stroke (less than 6 h) or in the subgroup with highest haematocrit (greater than 45%). Thus, moderate haemodilution does not improve the outcome in acute stroke patients.
Document 5 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): After the clinical diagnosis of stroke is made, an orderly process of evaluation and treatment should follow (Fig. 446-1). The first goal is to prevent or reverse brain injury. Attend to the patient’s airway, breathing, and circulation (ABCs), and treat hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia if identified. Perform an emergency noncontrast head CT scan to differentiate between ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke; there are no reliable clinical findings that conclusively separate ischemia from hemorrhage, although a more depressed level of consciousness, higher initial blood pressure, or worsening of symptoms after onset favor hemorrhage, and a deficit that is maximal at onset, or remits, suggests ischemia. Treatments designed to reverse or lessen the amount of tissue infarction and improve clinical outcome fall within six categories: (1) medical support, (2) IV thrombolysis, (3) endovascular revascularization, (4) antithrombotic treatment, (5) neuroprotection, and (6) stroke centers and
