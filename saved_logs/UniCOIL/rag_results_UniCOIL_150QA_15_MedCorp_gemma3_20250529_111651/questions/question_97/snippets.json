The admission flow deficits correlated with outcome. The admission and 6-mo scores correlated with clinical conditions at each time. At 2 wk, the flow deficits were smaller and did not correlate with clinical parameters. Nor did the presence or absence of hyperfixation of the radiopharmaceutical. Six months after the infarct, the flow defect had decreased in 9 of 15 patients in whom three serial scans were available, with better clinical improvement than in the remaining six whose flow deficits increased. More patients in the first group had been treated randomly with the calcium-entry blocker flunarizine. SPECT imaging of rCBF within 24 hr after stroke correlates with clinical outcome and condition, whereas rCBF imaging at 2 wk after the stroke shows no clinical correlation.",

I now evaluate the long-term outcome and potential risks of this combined venesection/dextran 40 therapy in the same 52 treated and 50 control patients. Mortality, need for institutional care, and recurrent strokes were registered during 1 year following inclusion in the trial, and a final evaluation of functional outcome was performed at 12 months after the stroke. Cerebrospinal fluid was analyzed for protein content and hemorrhagic admixture at two occasions during the acute phase. Thirty-six hemodiluted and 30 control patients survived the first year following the stroke (difference not significant). One year after the stroke, persistent neurological deficits were less frequent among the hemodiluted patients and a larger proportion of hemodiluted survivors was independent in walking (92% versus 73%, p less than 0.05). Two hemodiluted patients (6%) and nine control patients (30%) were totally dependent in the activities of daily living (p less than 0.05). Three hemodiluted patients (8%) and eight control patients (27%) remained hospitalized 1 year after the stroke (p less than 0.05). With the possible exception of patients with a medical history of congestive heart failure, subset analyses revealed a tendency toward improved outcome for hemodiluted patients in all clinically important subgroups compared with the controls. When analyzing cerebrospinal fluid, signs of blood-brain barrier breakdown and hemorrhagic admixture to the cerebrospinal fluid during the acute phase were less frequent in the hemodiluted subjects.
