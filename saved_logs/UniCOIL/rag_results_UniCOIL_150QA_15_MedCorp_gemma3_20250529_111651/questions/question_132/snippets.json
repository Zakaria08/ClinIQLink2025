Serologies for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, anti-nuclear antibody (ANA), c-ANCA, serine protease 3 (PR3) IgG, myeloperoxidase antibody (MPO), and complement levels were sent. He was started on losartan for proteinuria with plans for renal biopsy; however, he was lost to follow up. The patient then presented two weeks later with worsening edema to his waist, continued weight gain, mild hemoptysis, and streaks of blood in the stool. Physical examination now showed worsening pitting edema up to his waist with new non-pruritic, erythematous excoriations on the medial aspect of his thighs bilaterally. He was admitted to the hospital with concern for worsening vasculitis. He was started on oral prednisone and underwent a renal biopsy. For his edema, he was started on diuretics to which he responded well. Due to persistent leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing was performed to complete the workup.",

The seroprevalence of hepatitis B virus was 14.4% (95% CI Poisson distribution 12.2-16.5) for anti-HBc and 1.6% (95% CI, 0.9-2.5) for HBsAg. Antibodies against hepatitis C virus were detected by ELISA in 2.4% (CI 1.6-3.5) and by first generation RIBA in 0.9% (CI 0.4-1.6). Human immunodeficiency virus seroprevalence was 1.0% (CI 0.5-1.7).

Subcutaneous injection of 1.6 x 10(6) U of human recombinant IFN-alpha 2b per kg delivered peak concentrations in plasma of 3,600 U/ml at 2 h postadministration with a half-life of elimination of 2.9 h. This dosage of IFN-alpha could be delivered to cats for up to 12 weeks without significant clinical toxicity. Oral administration of AZT (20 mg/kg three times daily) resulted in peak concentrations in plasma of 3 micrograms/ml at 2 h with a half-life of elimination of approximately 1.60 h. Treatment of FeLV-FAIDS-infected cats with IFN-alpha, either alone or in combination with orally administered AZT, resulted in significant decreases in circulating p27 core antigen beginning 2 weeks after the initiation of therapy. AZT alone had no effect on circulating virus antigen. Depending upon whether high (1.6 x 10(6) U/kg)- or low (1.6 x 10(4) to 1.6 x 10(5) U/kg)-dosage IFN-alpha was used, cats became refractory to therapy 3 or 7 weeks after the beginning of treatment. At these times, IFN-alpha-treated animals developed antibodies to IFN-alpha that were neutralizing, specific for human recombinant IFN-alpha, and dose dependent in magnitude. The results of this study indicate that human recombinant IFN-alpha is effective in reducing circulating virus antigenic load in cats persistently infected with FeLV-FAIDS. However, the continued efficacy of IFN-alpha therapy appeared to be limited by the formation of cytokine-specific neutralizing antibodies.",

In a wheat germ translation system, a synthetic transcript resembling the 1.6-kb RNA expresses both ORFs 3 and 4. Moreover, the synthesis of the 6-kDa protein from ORF 4 depends on the translation efficiency of ORF 3, suggesting that in vivo, ORFs 3 and 4 are both expressed from the 1.6-kb RNA. The major in vitro translation product of TNV-A genomic RNA is the coat protein. We show that the region upstream of the coat protein promotes internal initiation of translation in vitro.
