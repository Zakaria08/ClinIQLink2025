O-Ag and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of the corresponding bacterial species were used as antigens for the sensitization of polystyrene plates. The primary and secondary humoral immune response was studied by means of EIA. As revealed in this investigation, the immunization of mice with HA-isolated antigenic preparations and O-Ag, obtained from S. typhimurium, in a single injection (in doses of 1-100 micrograms) led to the development of weak specific immune response to O-Ag. Response to LPS was absent. After the second immunization of the animals pronounced immune response to O-Ag and LPS was observed. It developed as a response of both IgM and IgG type. The immunization of mice, made in a single injection, with HA-isolated antigenic preparations and O-Ag, obtained from S. choleraesuis, did not lead to the development of O-specific immune response. After the immunization of mice with these antigens in two injections sharply pronounced nonspecific activity of IgM and IgG serum antibodies with respect to O-Ag and LPS of homologous and heterologous bacterial species was noted in EIA. Neither S. typhimurium O-polysaccharide, nor S. choleraesuis O-polysaccharide did not induce O-specific immune response even after the second immunization.",
        "contents": "[The characteristics of the O-specific humoral immune response of mice vaccinated with Salmonella choleraesuis antigens]. The work deals with the results of the comparative enzyme immunoassay (EIA) of serum samples taken from (CBA X C57BL/6) F1 mice immunized with O-specific polysaccharides, O-antigens (O-Ag) obtained by Boivin's method and antigenic preparations isolated with hydroxylamine (HA) from S. choleraesuis and S. typhimurium. O-Ag and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of the corresponding bacterial species were used as antigens for the sensitization of polystyrene plates. The primary and secondary humoral immune response was studied by means of EIA. As revealed in this investigation, the immunization of mice with HA-isolated antigenic preparations and O-Ag, obtained from S. typhimurium, in a single injection (in doses of 1-100 micrograms) led to the development of weak specific immune response to O-Ag. Response to LPS was absent. After the second immunization of the animals pronounced immune response to O-Ag and LPS was observed. It developed as a response of both IgM and IgG type. The immunization of mice, made in a single injection, with HA-isolated antigenic preparations and O-Ag, obtained from S. choleraesuis, did not lead to the development of O-specific immune response. After the immunization of mice with these antigens in two injections sharply pronounced nonspecific activity of IgM and IgG serum antibodies with respect to O-Ag and LPS of homologous and heterologous bacterial species was noted in EIA. Neither S. typhimurium O-polysaccharide, nor S. choleraesuis O-polysaccharide did not induce O-specific immune response even after the second immunization.",

Primary immune response to this antigen has been studied with the use of the new method. Immune response to the optimum immunogenic dose of O-antigen has a manifest variable character. The intensity of primary immune response has been shown to rise with the increase of the dose of O-antigen from 0.004 to 50 micrograms. The preliminary injection of 200 micrograms of O-antigen, followed by the injection of cyclophosphamide 2 days later, leads to the development of specific immunological tolerance to O-antigen in experimental animals.",
