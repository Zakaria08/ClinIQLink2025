Document 1 (Title: Phosphate transport in isolated rat inner medullary collecting duct.): Phosphate transport by the inner medullary collecting duct of normal rats was studied using an in vitro microperfusion technique. Net (Jnet), lumen-to-bath (Jlb) and bath-to-lumen (Jbl) phosphate fluxes were measured using 32PO4 as tracer, in the absence of net water absorption. A net absorption of phosphate (22.3 +/- 3.3 pmol cm-2 s-1) was observed by direct determination, and was similar to the difference between the Jlb and Jbl (57.7 +/- 8.2 and 32.2 +/- 1.5 pmol cm-2 s-1 respectively). The addition of amiloride (10 microM) to the perfusate did not change the Jlb of phosphate but blocked the efflux of sodium. Also, the withdrawal of sodium from the bath and perfusion solution did not change the Jlb of phosphate. In parallel, the addition of ouabain (10 mM) to the bath fluid decreased the Jlb of sodium more (37%) than the Jlb of phosphate (12%) and did not change the Jbl of phosphate. The addition of arsenate (10 microM) to the perfusate both in the presence and in the absence of sodium caused a decrease in...
Document 2 (Title: Linear complex structure): The (complex) tensor, symmetric, and exterior algebras over VC also admit decompositions. The exterior algebra is perhaps the most important application of this decomposition. In general, if a vector space U admits a decomposition U = S ⊕ T then the exterior powers of U can be decomposed as follows: A complex structure J on V therefore induces a decomposition where All exterior powers are taken over the complex numbers. So if VJ has complex dimension n (real dimension 2n) then The dimensions add up correctly as a consequence of Vandermonde's identity. The space of (p,q)-forms Λp,q VJ* is the space of (complex) multilinear forms on VC which vanish on homogeneous elements unless p are from V+ and q are from V−. It is also possible to regard Λp,q VJ* as the space of real multilinear maps from VJ to C which are complex linear in p terms and conjugate-linear in q terms. See complex differential form and almost complex manifold for applications of these ideas.
Document 3 (Title: Direct limit): Let p be a prime number. Consider the direct system composed of the factor groups and the homomorphisms induced by multiplication by . The direct limit of this system consists of all the roots of unity of order some power of , and is called the Prüfer group . There is a (non-obvious) injective ring homomorphism from the ring of symmetric polynomials in variables to the ring of symmetric polynomials in variables. Forming the direct limit of this direct system yields the ring of symmetric functions. Let F be a C-valued sheaf on a topological space X. Fix a point x in X. The open neighborhoods of x form a directed set ordered by inclusion (U ≤ V if and only if U contains V). The corresponding direct system is (F(U), rU,V) where r is the restriction map. The direct limit of this system is called the stalk of F at x, denoted Fx. For each neighborhood U of x, the canonical morphism F(U) → Fx associates to a section s of F over U an element sx of the stalk Fx called the germ of s at x.
Document 4 (Title: Hyperamylasemia -- Introduction): Hyperamylasemia refers to an elevated serum amylase level beyond the upper limit of normal (the normal range is typically 30 U/L to 110 U/L). Amylase is 1 of the digestive enzymes that is designed to act intracellularly. Its function is to break down starch into smaller carbohydrate units, yielding monosaccharides in the end. The process is completed using hydrolysis of the glycoside bonds, causing the release of maltose and oligosaccharides. Serum amylase is mainly released from the pancreas (40%-45%) and salivary glands (55%-60%). It is an enzyme produced in 2 isoforms, P-type amylase and S-type amylase. P-type amylase is secreted from the pancreas, while S-type amylase is secreted from the salivary glands. Amidase clearance occurs through the kidney (25%) and the reticuloendothelial system (75%). [1] [2] Serum amylase is not the most appropriate test for diagnosing pancreatitis as it lacks specificity. Although it is increased in around 75% of cases of pancreatitis, serum amylase may be within the normal r...
