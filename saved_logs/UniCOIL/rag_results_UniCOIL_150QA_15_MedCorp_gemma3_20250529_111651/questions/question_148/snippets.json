When given at 4, 1.6, or 1 g/kg in undiluted injection volumes iv 1 hr prior to a range of single doses of radiation with inspired carbogen dose modifying factors (DMF's) based on tumor growth delay (TGD) in the Lewis lung tumor of 2.5, 1.7, and 1.5, respectively, were produced. When the PFC dose was administered in a volume of 0.2 ml, the dose modifying factors produced by 4 g/kg (0.1 ml undiluted) did not change significantly (2.6), but the dose modifying factors produced by 1.6 g/kg (0.04 ml undiluted) and by 1.0 g/kg (0.025 ml undiluted) increased significantly to 2.0 and 1.8 (p less than 0.05), respectively. Using the tumor excision assay at 24 hr post treatment in the FSaIIC fibrosarcoma, administration of 6, 4, or 2 g/kg in 0.2 ml injections plus carbogen breathing 1 hr prior to and during treatment resulted in dose modifying factors of 1.5, 1.6, and 1.3, respectively. In a fractionated radiation protocol in the Lewis lung tumor using four daily fractions, a dose of 4 g/kg of PFC on days 1 and 3 proved superior to a dose of 2 g/kg daily (dose modifying factors 2.4 vs. 1.9, p less than 0.05). When a fractionated radiation regimen of 3 Gy daily X 5 and carbogen was used, PFC doses of 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 g/kg administered undiluted produced increasing tumor growth delays with increasing dose of PFCE and increasing frequency of administration. In addition, dilutions to 0.2 ml proved significantly more effective. In a 2-week fractionated radiation protocol using 2, 3, or 4 Gy daily X 5 weekly, PFCE given in 0.2 ml volume plus carbogen breathing daily at 4, 1.6, or 1 g/kg produced dose modifying factors of 2.0, 1.9, and 1.6, respectively.

In 62 infants who successfully responded to HBV vaccine with a titer of anti-HBs greater than 2(3), anti-HBs titer was monitored for as long as 48 months (25.6 +/- 11.0 mo) and found to decrease as follows: 5.1 +/- 1.7 at 12 mo., 4.5 +/- 1.8 at 18 mo., 4.2 +/- 1.8 at 24 mo., 4.0 +/- 1.6 at 30 mo., 3.7 +/- 1.7 at 36 mo., 3.2 +/- 2.0 at 48 mo. During the follow-up period, eight HBV events (11.9%) were demonstrated: one case showed an increase of anti-HBs, three showed a reappearance of anti-HBc alone, three showed a reappearance of anti-HBc with increase of anti-HBs, and one became a chronic HBV carrier. All infants were further divided into three groups by their maximal response of anti-HBs to HBV vaccine: Group I (greater than or equal to 2(6)), Group II (2(3)-2(5)), and Group III (2(2) greater than or equal to). Group I sustained a higher titer from 12 to 30 months of age and had less HBV events than G-II and G-III. Our study suggests that acquisition of a high titer of anti-HBs is important in long-term prevention of HBV infection as well as in the neonatal period in infants born to HBeAg positive HBV carrier mothers.",
