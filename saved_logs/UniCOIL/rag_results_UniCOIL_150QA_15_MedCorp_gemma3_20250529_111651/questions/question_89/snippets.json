        "content": "The pro-cathepsin D of Mr 52,000 is regulated by estrogens via the estrogen receptor (RE) and is secreted by breast cancer cells in vitro. In an attempt to predict the hormone responsiveness of breast cancer in vivo, we have assayed total 52K cathepsin D and its precursor in the primary breast cancer cytosol of 36 patients treated before surgery with 30 mg of tamoxifen daily for 1 to 5 weeks (average, 3 weeks). Compared to a similar control population, total 52K cathepsin D was increased by tamoxifen (P = 0.02) but less so than its precursor (P less than 0.001). Furthermore, 45% of the RE-positive tumors from tamoxifen-treated patients had a higher cathepsin D precursor concentration than the same type of tumor from control patients, or than RE-negative tumors from tamoxifen-treated patients. This 3-week challenge test was probably too short to avoid partial estrogenic activity of tamoxifen (flare) and the authors infer that longer time of treatment would decrease rather than increase the concentration of cathepsin D in the RE-responsive tumors. However, two cancers from patients with relapses after prolonged tamoxifen treatment (greater than 6 months) also had high concentrations of 52K cathepsin D and its precursor. The authors conclude that the concentration of cathepsin D and its precursor in breast cancer cytosol can be increased by short-term tamoxifen treatment, suggesting that these tumors are estrogen responsive.",

The 15 patients who died during the first month after the Hartmann's operation were excluded from the study, the 54 survivors including 32 men and 22 women, mean age 68 +/- 12 years (range 19 to 87 years). The initial indication for surgery was: complicated sigmoid diverticulis (n = 26), cancer of colon (n = 14) or other site (n = 14). Colon continuity was re-established in 23 patients (42.6%), including 15 men and 8 women, mean age 60 +/- 10 years (range 38 to 78 years). In this latter group, 82.6% of the patients were under 70 years of age, indicative of a significant effect of age (p &lt; 0.001) on re-establishment of continuity. Secondary anastomosis was obtained in 65.4% of cases of complicated sigmoid diverticulitis, whereas re-establishment of continuity was possible in only 7.1% of colon cancer patients (p &lt; 0.001). The mean duration prior to re-establishment was 4.8 +/- 1.6 months (range 2.5 to 9 months). Morbidity was high (47.8%) and mortality 4.3% (1 patient). Hartmann's operation remains indicated for stages III and IV of complicated sigmoid diverticulosis, as well as for other benign affections (volvulus of sigmoid, perforation of sigmoid following injury), although it must be recognized that the possibilities of re-establishment are limited more in elderly patients and that fewer patients with colon cancer can benefit from the procedure.

        "content": "LGGs can recur years to decades after initial definitive treatment. These patients may present with seizures, new neurologic deficits, or progression on follow-up imaging. Treatment management in this area is controversial, and the data remain retrospective. Re-resection can be considered when complete resection of the tumor is possible. The completeness of resection at primary treatment and re-resection influences overall survival. [41] The evidence does not suggest a decrement in overall survival with recurrent patients undergoing multiple resections. However, it must be emphasized that a diligent preoperative evaluation with adequate imaging is required to determine the probability of a successful complete resection while minimizing the risk of postoperative morbidity. Functional mapping or intra-operative molecular imaging can be used.",

        "content": "The total amount of cathepsin-D (mature forms and pro-enzyme especially) in the cytosol of 88 breast cancers including 85 primary cancers and 11 axillary lymph node metastasis was measured by way of immuno-radiometric assay. Maximum follow-up is 58 months. Cathepsin-D was found to be independent of clinical and biological parameters including axillary lymph node involvement and oestradiol receptors (RE). Univariate analysis has pointed out a significant linkage between overall survival and cathepsin-D, using a cut-off level of 30 pmol/mg protein which is the most discriminating value. Cathepsin-D appeared to be particularly useful in lymph-node-positive and RE-negative patients but it was not significant in the node-negative population. Multivariate analysis of the overall survival (Cox model) revealed that it was strongly related to oestradiol receptor, lymph node involvement and cathepsin-D.",
