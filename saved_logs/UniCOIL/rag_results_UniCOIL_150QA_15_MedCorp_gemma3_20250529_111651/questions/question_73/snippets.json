Various A-B scales have been used to predict differential process and outcome of A and B therapist with schizophrenics and neurotics, respectively. Although significant results frequently have been reported, findings of different studies have seemed to contradict each other, and most independent replication attempts have failed. Since reliable differences in outcomes achieved by various therapists-patient pairings have not been demonstrated, the confusing proliferation of theories concerning what A-B factors \"make the difference\" seems rather premature. A review of outcome and process studies in this area indicates that the phenomena under investigation are much more complex than is reflected in the previous A-B hypotheses. Therapist A-B scores do not predict every kind of success with every kind of patient generically labeled \"schizophrenic\" or \"neurotic\" in every kind of treatment program. This conclusion need not arouse pessimism regarding the value of further A-Bresearch, but it clearly demands greater specificity in hypotheses and in research design. The failure of many recent studies to include true B type therapists has made their findings irrelevant to the A-B hypotheses, and has raised the question of whether the B therapist has become \"extinct.\" To provide further information about this phenomenon of the vanishing B therapist, the present authors conducted a survey of all Seattle psychiatrists in private practice. The survey yielded a total distribution of A-B scores which is not significatly skewed in either the A or B direction. However, most of the B's had graduated from residency training prior to 1960, while most of the A's had graduated in more recent years. These results suggest that, although current residency programs may not have enough B doctors for meaningful A-B research, such doctors do exist in the community.",

Analysis was performed separately for all patients (group A) and for a subsample (group B), obtained by excluding coronary care patients. Calculation of risk and classification of patients were carried out as recommended in the literature for MPM, APACHE II, and SAPS. In group A, sensitivities (correct prediction of hospital mortality) were 44.7%, 51.1%, and 21.2% and specificities (correct prediction of survival) were 84.5%, 85.4%, and 96.8%, respectively; overall correct classification rates were 73.3%, 75.8%, and 75.6%. In group B, sensitivities were slightly higher, but total correct classification rates did not reach group A levels. Goodness-of-fit testing showed low levels of fit for all methods in both groups. Application of APACHE II to diagnostic subgroups, using disease-adapted risk calculations, revealed marked inconsistencies between the estimated risk and the observed mortality. We conclude that the estimation of risk on admission by the three methods investigated might be helpful for global comparisons of ICU populations, although the lack of disease specificity reduces their applicability for severity grading of a given illness. The inaccuracy of these methods makes them ineffective for predicting individual outcome; thus, they provide little advantage in clinical decision-making.",
