Document 1 (Title: Meconium Aspiration -- Introduction): Meconium is the earliest stool of a newborn. Occasionally, newborns pass meconium during labor or delivery, resulting in a meconium-stained amniotic fluid (MSAF). Meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS) is the neonatal respiratory distress that occurs in a newborn in the context of MSAF when respiratory symptoms cannot be attributed to another etiology. [1] The spectrum of manifestations associated with meconium aspiration is broad, ranging from mild distress to more severe respiratory failure. More life-threatening conditions have been recognized to also be associated with MAS, notably persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) and air leak syndromes. [2]
Document 2 (Title: [Relationship of chest roentgenographic features and outcome in meconium aspiration syndrome].): Aspiration of meconium may produce respiratory distress of various severity and outcome. It is the purpose of this study to evaluate the relationship between roentgenographic feature of initial chest roentgenogram (less than 10 hours old) and outcome in infants with meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS). We analyzed retrospectively the clinical data and initial chest roentgenograms of 65 infants who had MAS and who were admitted to NICU of Mackay Memorial Hospital in 1987. The incidence and the mortality rate in this hospital were 0.33% and 15.4% respectively. Infiltration was seen in 52, consolidation or atelectasis in 18, hyperinflation in 17, air leak in 11, and cardiomegaly in 4. The outcome was similar between infants with the first four features. Four infants with cardiomegaly also had other types of roentgenographic feature and PH value of initial blood gas less than 7.0, which means that their poor outcome was influenced by multiple factors. From this observation we concluded that the initial chest roent...

Document 4 (Title: Acute respiratory distress syndrome): The primary treatment involves mechanical ventilation together with treatments directed at the underlying cause. Ventilation strategies include using low volumes and low pressures. If oxygenation remains insufficient, lung recruitment maneuvers and neuromuscular blockers may be used. If these are insufficient, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) may be an option. The syndrome is associated with a death rate between 35 and 50%. Globally, ARDS affects more than 3 million people a year. The condition was first described in 1967. Although the terminology of "adult respiratory distress syndrome" has at times been used to differentiate ARDS from "infant respiratory distress syndrome" in newborns, the international consensus is that "acute respiratory distress syndrome" is the best term because ARDS can affect people of all ages. There are separate diagnostic criteria for children and those in areas of the world with fewer resources.
