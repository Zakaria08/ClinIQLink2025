When the PFC dose was administered in a volume of 0.2 ml, the dose modifying factors produced by 4 g/kg (0.1 ml undiluted) did not change significantly (2.6), but the dose modifying factors produced by 1.6 g/kg (0.04 ml undiluted) and by 1.0 g/kg (0.025 ml undiluted) increased significantly to 2.0 and 1.8 (p less than 0.05), respectively. Using the tumor excision assay at 24 hr post treatment in the FSaIIC fibrosarcoma, administration of 6, 4, or 2 g/kg in 0.2 ml injections plus carbogen breathing 1 hr prior to and during treatment resulted in dose modifying factors of 1.5, 1.6, and 1.3, respectively.

The mechanism of the exchange reaction was probed using (2S,3S)-3-methylaspartic acid and its C-3-deuteriated isotopomer. Incubations conducted in tritiated water allowed the rate of protium or deuterium wash-out from the substrates to be measured as tritium wash-in. The primary deuterium isotope effects for the exchange under essentially Vmax conditions ( [S] much greater than Km) were 1.6, 1.5, and 1.5 at pH 9.0, 7.6, and 6.5. The deamination reaction, measured spectrophotometrically on the same incubations, showed isotope effects of 1.7, 1.6, and 1.4 at pH 9.0, 7.6, and 6.5, in agreement with the values of DV and D(V/K) reported previously [Botting, N.P., Akhtar, M., Cohen, M.A., &amp; Gani, D. (1988) Biochemistry 27, 2956-2959]. The ratio of the rate of exchange to the rate of deamination, however, varied widely with pH. Together with the identical values of the primary isotope effects for the two reactions, this result indicates that the partition between reaction pathways occurs after the slowest steps in the common part of the reaction coordinate pathway, almost certainly after the cleavage of the C-N bond at the level of the enzyme-ammonia-mesaconic acid complex, and not at the putative carbanion level as was previously suggested. The enzyme requires both K+ and Mg2+ ions for activity, although ammonium ion is also able to bind in the K+ site and act as an activator. Variation of the metal ion concentration alters the magnitude of the primary deuterium isotope effects. The variation of potassium ion concentration causes the most marked changes: at 1.6 mM K+, DV and D(V/K) are 1.7, whereas at 50 mM K+, DV and D(V/K) are reduced to 1.0. The isotope effects are also reduced at low K+ concentration due to the emergence of a slow-acting high K+ affinity monopotassium form of the enzyme. The binding order and role of the metal ion cofactors and their influence in determining the formal mechanism of the reaction is discussed, and the failure of previous workers to observe primary deuterium isotope effects for the deamination process is explained.

These methods are applied to the Framingham Heart Study, where the 10-year incidence of coronary heart disease is related to several coronary risk factors among 1,731 men disease-free at examination 4. Reproducibility data are obtained from the subgroup of 1,346 men seen at examinations 2 and 3. Estimated odds ratios comparing extreme quintiles for risk factors with substantial error were increased after correction for measurement error (serum cholesterol, 2.2 vs. 2.9; serum glucose, 1.3 vs. 1.5; systolic blood pressure, 2.8 vs. 3.8), but were generally decreased or unchanged for risk factors with little or no error (body mass index, 1.6 vs. 1.6; age 65-69 years vs. 35-44 years, 4.3 vs. 3.8; smoking, 1.7 vs. 1.7).",

        "title": "Membrane insertion and lateral diffusion of fluorescence-labelled cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV signal peptide in charged and uncharged phospholipid bilayers.",
        "content": "The synthetic 25-residue signal peptide of cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV was labelled with the fluorophor 7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole (NBD) at its single cysteine residue. Addition of small unilamellar vesicles of 1-palmitoyl 2-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine (POPC) to the labelled peptide resulted in a shift of the NBD excitation and emission spectra to shorter wavelengths. Binding of the peptide to the vesicles was measured by the increase in the fluorescence emission yield. A surface partition constant of (3.9 +/- 0.5) x 10(3) M-1 was derived from these titrations. When the membrane contained, in addition to POPC, negatively charged 1-palmitoyl 2-oleoyl phosphatidylglycerol (POPG), the NBD fluorescence spectra were further shifted to shorter wavelengths and exhibited increased quantum yields. The apparent partition constants were increased to 10(4)-10(5) M-1 for vesicles with 20 or 100 mol% POPG. Lateral diffusion of the peptide was measured by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching in multibilayers of POPC, POPG, POPC/POPG (4:1) and 1,2-dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine. The lateral diffusion coefficients of the peptide in bilayers of POPC (8 x 10(-8) cm2/s at 21 degrees C) were 1.5-1.6-fold greater than those of NBD-labelled phospholipids (5 x 10(-8) cm2/s at 21 degrees C), but 1.5-1.8-fold smaller (3 x 10(-8) cm2/s in 20% POPG and at 21 degrees C) than the lipid diffusion coefficients in the negatively charged bilayers. It is concluded that the signal peptide associates with phospholipid bilayers in two different forms, which depend on the lipid charge. The experiments with POPC bilayers are well explained by a model in which the peptide partitions into the region of the phospholipid head-groups and diffuses along the membrane/water interface. If POPG is present in the membrane, electrostatic attractions between the basic residues of the peptide and the acidic lipid head-groups result in a deeper penetration of the bilayer. For this case, two models that are both consistent with the experimental data are discussed, in which the peptide either forms an oligomer of three to six partially helical membrane-spanning monomers, or inserts into the bilayer with its amphiphilic helical segment aligned parallel to the plane of the membrane and located near the head-group and outer hydrocarbon region of the bilayer.",

        "content": "We investigated the effects of short term glucocorticoid excess on the gonadotropic and somatotropic axes in healthy men. Subjects (n = 5) underwent blood sampling at 10-min intervals for 6 h before and on days 2, 5, and 8 of glucocorticoid treatment, and for 24 h (n = 6) to examine pulsatile LH and GH release before and during dexamethasone administration (1.5 mg orally twice daily for 1 week). In the time-course study, we found significant decreases on day 8 in serum concentrations of estradiol (from 144 +/- 18 to 99 +/- 18 pmol/L), free testosterone (from 105 +/- 10 to 87 +/- 10 pmol/L), and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (from 6.0 +/- 1.6 to 1.7 +/- 0.3 mumol/L; P less than 0.05). Mean serum LH concentrations did not change (baseline, 5.3 +/- 1.2 IU/L; glucocorticoid, 4.2 +/- 0.61 IU/L). The mean plasma somatomedin-C concentration rose from 0.74 +/- 0.08 to 2.0 +/- 0.35 U/mL (P less than 0.05), and the mean serum GH concentration increased from 1.2 +/- 0.90 micrograms/L (basal) to 4.2 +/- 1.5 micrograms/L (day 8 of dexamethasone; P less than 0.01). Deconvolution analysis of 24-h serum GH and LH concentration profiles revealed that the half-life of endogenous GH and the duration and amplitude (maximal rate of secretion) of computer-resolved GH secretory bursts were not influenced significantly by dexamethasone. The mass of GH secreted per burst rose 1.6-fold. Glucocorticoid treatment also increased detectable GH secretory burst frequency from 12 +/- 1.6 to 18 +/- 1.6 episodes/24 h, decreased the GH interburst interval from 127 +/- 23 to 79 +/- 5 min, and increased the daily GH secretion rate from 41 +/- 11 to 101 +/- 11 micrograms/L.day. These effects on the somatotropic axis were specific, since the half-life of LH; LH secretory burst frequency, amplitude, mass, and duration; and the total daily LH production rate (and LH secretion in response to exogenous GnRH) were not altered by dexamethasone administration. We conclude that short term moderate glucocorticoid excess augments pulsatile GH secretion without influencing the episodic release of LH in normal men.",
