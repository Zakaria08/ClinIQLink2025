Seven weeks old, male BALB/c nude mice were implanted with 1 X 10(6) cells of human gastric cancer G/F into either their subcutis or the stomach wall. Fourteen days after the implantation, the mice were injected daily once for 10 days with peplomycin or mitomycin C. Peplomycin was effective on the subcutaneous tumors with an inhibition rate of 26 and 64% at doses of 1.5 and 6.0 mg/kg, respectively. Peplomycin was ineffective on the tumors in the stomach wall. Mitomycin C was ineffective on the subcutaneous tumors, but effective on the tumors in the stomach wall and the inhibition rate was 52 and 63% at doses of 0.13 and 0.5 mg/kg, respectively. Study on the distribution of peplomycin and mitomycin C to those tumors revealed that peplomycin and mitomycin C levels in the subcutaneous tumors were 2 to 7 times and about 3 times higher than those in the stomach wall, respectively. Thus, drug distribution could not explain the differences in drug sensitivity. The sensitivity of the tumor in the stomach wall to peplomycin and mitomycin C was consistent with the clinical efficacy of these drugs against human gastric cancers. This suggests that models where the tumors are implanted into its original organ are useful for predicting clinical efficacy in experimental cancer chemotherapy.",

The superiority of SPECT compared with planar imaging has been demonstrated for cardiac and brain imaging.

The abortifacient efficacy of 15 me F-2alpha was similar in both groups; over 90% of the patients aborted with a single dose. There was a higher incidence of vomiting, diarrhoea and incomplete abortions in the group treated with 2.5 mg 15 me F-2alpha. Although the mean injection-abortion interval in the 2.5 mg group was shorter, it is concluded that intra-amniotic administration of 1 mg 15 me F-2alpha provides a better regime, giving high efficacy with a single dose, a low incidence of side effects and greater safety in case of inadvertent entry of the intra-amniotic dose into systemic circulation.",

Termination of second trimester pregnancy with intra-amniotic administration of 15 (S) 15 methyl prostaglandin F-alpha (15 me F-alpha) was attempted in fifty patients. One group (26 patients) was given 1 mg of the analogue and the other group received 2.5 mg. The abortifacient efficacy of 15 me F-2alpha was similar in both groups; over 90% of the patients aborted with a single dose.

        "content": "Modern radionuclide PET scan imaging and targeted radiopharmaceutical therapy can significantly change management decisions in over 50% of prostate cancer patients tested and offer substantially improved survival in those with advanced disease. [90] [91] PSMA PET imaging is superior to CT imaging and standard bone scans for the staging of prostate cancer. [92] [93] PSMA-based imaging should be performed before antiandrogen hormonal therapy is started (NCCN recommendation.) Ga-68-PSMA-11 and F-18-piflufolastat (DCFPyL) PET imaging have each demonstrated higher sensitivity than C-11 choline or F-18 fluciclovine PET imaging, especially at very low PSA levels. No separate bone scan is necessary when performing a Ga-68-PSMA-11 or F-18 piflufolastat (DCFPyL) PSMA PET/CT scan. Tc-99m-PSMA single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) can be a cost-effective alternative to more expensive PET scans.",
