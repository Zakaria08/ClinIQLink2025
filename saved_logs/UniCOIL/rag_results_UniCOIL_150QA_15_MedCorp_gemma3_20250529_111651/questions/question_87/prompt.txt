Document 2 (Title: Nuclear Medicine Applications in Prostate Cancer -- Technique or Treatment -- Summary: PET-Based Radionuclide Imaging in Prostate Cancer): Only 2 PET tracers are FDA-approved and recommended by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) for use in the initial staging of prostate cancer for patients with suspected metastatic disease AND biochemical recurrence or progression. [F-18] F-PSMA piflufolastat (DCFPyL) [Ga-68] Ga-PSMA-11 Five PET tracers are FDA-Approved and recommended by the NCCN for use only in prostate cancer patients with biochemical recurrence or progression.

Document 3 (Title: Fluorodeoxyglucose (18F)): Since its development in 1976, 18F-FDG had a profound influence on research in the neurosciences. The subsequent discovery in 1980 that 18F-FDG accumulates in tumors underpins the evolution of PET as a major clinical tool in cancer diagnosis. 18F-FDG is now the standard radiotracer used for PET neuroimaging and cancer patient management. The images can be assessed by a nuclear medicine physician or radiologist to provide diagnoses of various medical conditions.

Document 5 (Title: C-peptide): Patients with diabetes may have their C-peptide levels measured as a means of distinguishing type 1 diabetes from type 2 diabetes or Maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY). Measuring C-peptide can help to determine how much of their own natural insulin a person is producing as C-peptide is secreted in equimolar amounts to insulin. C-peptide levels are measured instead of insulin levels because C-peptide can assess a person's own insulin secretion even if they receive insulin injections, and because the liver metabolizes a large and variable amount of insulin secreted into the portal vein but does not metabolise C-peptide, meaning blood C-peptide may be a better measure of portal insulin secretion than insulin itself. A very low C-peptide confirms Type 1 diabetes and insulin dependence and is associated with high glucose variability, hyperglycaemia and increased complications. The test may be less helpful close to diagnosis, particularly where a patient is overweight and insulin
