Document 2 (Title: Minimizing gang violence in the emergency department.): Street gang members are frequently injured, and the violence of their subculture may follow them from the streets into the emergency department. We present four cases in which in-hospital gang violence occurred or was prevented. To decrease the risk of injury from gang-related violence within the hospital, we offer guidelines for patient care and health care provider safety. Emphasis is on education, awareness, and early hospital security involvement.
Document 3 (Title: Excimer Laser Coronary Angioplasty -- Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes): Since excimer laser coronary angioplasty (ELCA) is still a relatively new procedure, there are no evidence-based guidelines currently to ensure optimal outcomes. A "5 S approach" has been suggested to achieve the best results from ELCA, which are [15] : S election of patient S ize of the laser catheter S ettings (fluence and pulse rate) S aline infusion protocol S low advancement
Document 4 (Title: Bacterial Endocarditis -- Treatment / Management -- Treatment of specific organisms:): Methicillin-sensitive S. aureus : nafcillin or oxacillin If nonsevere penicillin allergy: cefazolin If severe penicillin allergy: vancomycin and daptomycin Methicillin-resistant S. aureus or coagulase-negative staphylococci: vancomycin for 6 weeks Viridans streptococci and S. gallolyticus : penicillin G or ceftriaxone for 4 weeks. If penicillin-resistant: penicillin G for four weeks plus gentamicin for the first two weeks. Penicillin allergy: vancomycin S. pneumoniae : penicillin G, cefazolin, or ceftriaxone for four weeks Penicillin allergy: vancomycin Enterococcal species: penicillin or ampicillin plus gentamicin for 4 to 6 weeks Penicillin allergy: vancomycin plus gentamicin for 6 weeks. Vancomycin-resistant enterococcus: linezolid or quinupristin-dalfopristin or imipenem HACEK organisms: ceftriaxone, ampicillin or ciprofloxacin for 4 weeks
Document 5 (Title: Morphology of the tracheobronchial tree of the Ganges river dolphin (Platanista gangetica).): To contribute to the phylogenetic evaluation of the river dolphin, the morphology of the tracheobronchial tree of the Ganges river dolphin was analyzed according to Nakakuki's fundamental bronchial tree model of mammals. In the right lung, the bronchial tree consists of the tracheal bronchus, five lateral series bronchi, three dorsal series bronchi and one ventral series bronchus. In the left lung, it consists of five lateral series bronchi, four dorsal series bronchi and one ventral series bronchus. In the Ganges river dolphin, the tracheal bronchus corresponds to type III of Nakakuki's nomenclature. This characteristic is of especial interest in light of the fact that the Ganges river dolphin has a forestomach as do Artiodactyla.
