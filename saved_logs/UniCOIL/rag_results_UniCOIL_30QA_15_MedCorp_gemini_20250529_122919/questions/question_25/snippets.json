        "content": "In the present study the effect of acute and short-term ketanserin administration on serotonin (5-HT)-induced aggregation was investigated in eight healthy volunteers. They received 40 mg ketanserin three times a day for 1 week. Blood samples were drawn before (A), 1.5 h after the first dose (B), 12 h after the evening dose of the 7th day (C), and 1.5 h after the morning dose of the 8th day (D). The maximal rate of aggregation (mm/min +/- SEM) was significantly decreased following the first dose (A: 47.6 +/- 6.0; B: 27.6 +/- 4.5; p less than 0.05); 12 h after the evening dose of the 7th day, the platelets aggregated more rapidly with 5-HT than before the onset of the study (C: 69.4 +/- 6.0; A vs. p less than 0.01). The last dose of ketanserin abolished this hyperresponsiveness (D: 46.1 +/- 7.58; C vs. D, p less than 0.05); however, there was no significant difference in the velocity of aggregation between the onset of the study and after the last dose. It appears that ketanserin has a double effect on platelet aggregation: an initial hyporesponsiveness to 5-HT is followed by a delayed hyperresponsiveness that is temporarily corrected by renewed ketanserin intake. In vitro dose-response curves suggested that prolonged ketanserin intake results in a higher \"sensitivity\" of the platelets to serotonin rather than a refractoriness of the platelets to ketanserin.",

After a 12-h overnight fast, each subject was given a fat-rich meal (1 g fat/kg body weight) and venous blood samples were obtained at hourly intervals for 10 h. TRL were isolated from bihourly plasma samples by ultracentrifugation (d less than 1.006 g/ml) and apo(a) was measured by radioimmunoassay. Total plasma apo(a) concentration did not change after the meal. However, TRL apo(a) increased significantly (0 h: 3 +/- 1, 4 h: 30 +/- 7 U/l; p less than 0.001) and 'd greater than 1.006' apo(a) decreased (0 h: 267 +/- 56, 4 h: 231 +/- 50 U/l; P less than 0.05). Similar postprandial changes were observed in apoB concentration (TRL apo B at 0 h: 10.3 +/- 1.5, 4 h: 13.6 +/- 1.7 g/l, P less than 0.001, 'd greater than 1.006' apoB at 0 h: 118 +/- 7, 4 h: 110 +/- 7 g/l, P less than 0.001). In the fasted state 2.0 +/- 1.0% and in the fed state (4 h postprandially) 16.0 +/- 4.6% of total plasma apo(a) was found in the TRL fraction. Eleven subjects had less than 10% of total apo(a) in TRL, 5 had 25% or more apo(a) in TRL in the fed state. Postprandial increase in TRL apo(a) was significantly correlated (r = 0.75, P less than 0.001) with increase in plasma triglycerides. TRL apo(a) concentration in the fed state was not correlated with total fasting cholesterol, triglyceride, apo(a) or HDL cholesterol concentration. We conclude that in some individuals, TRL apo(a) makes a significant contribution to total plasma apo(a) concentration in the fed state.",

        "content": "Injections of ethanolamine-O-sulfate (EOS) (200 microgram/kg) through chronic indwelling cannulae into the zona reticulata of the substantia nigra in rats produced immediate contraversive turning (away from the injection side). Bilateral injections produced spontaneous stereotyped behaviors including sniffing and biting. Twenty-four hours after the first injection of EOS the rats showed a significantly decreased locomotor response to 1.5 mg/kg D-amphetamine. The spontaneous behaviors elicited following the initial injection of EOS increased both in nature and duration with the second and third injections of EOS, and persevered for 24 h. At this time 1.5 mg/kg D-amphetamine intensified this spontaneous stereotyped behavior. GABA levels were significantly higher in substantia nigra, hypothalamus, corpus striatum and cerebral cortex 24 h following single or repeated (3 x) injections of 200 microgram/kg of EOS into the zona reticulata of the SN. Dopamine levels in the corpus striatum were unchanged 24 h following the EOS treatment except by the injection procedure itself. Control injections into the thalamus produced no turning or stereotypy, nor an enhanced response to 1.5 mg/kg D-amphetamine. GABA levels were, however, significantly higher in the substantia nigra and thalamus 24 h following repeated injections (3 x) of EOS into the thalamus. Results are consistent with the hypothesis that GABA containing neurons comprise part of the efferent output of the corpus striatum and do not act exclusively through a dopaminergic substrate.",

The intensity of color is proportional to the glucose concentration in the sample. The GOD enzyme can act on β-D-glucose only.

To optimize the results, a mutarotase enzyme should be added, or an extended incubation time is needed to complete the reaction. [13]",
        "contents": "Hexokinase Method -- Introduction. In the GOD-POD method, β-D-glucose is first oxidized by the GOD enzyme, leading to hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) formation. This H 2 O 2 reacts with a colorless chromogen substrate in the presence of peroxidase (POD) to produce a colored product. The intensity of color is proportional to the glucose concentration in the sample. The GOD enzyme can act on β-D-glucose only. At equilibrium, alpha and β isomers of D-glucose are at 36% and 64%, respectively. To optimize the results, a mutarotase enzyme should be added, or an extended incubation time is needed to complete the reaction. [13]"

Increased, or steepening, base curve ( D 1 ) causes increased magnification and decreased minification. Increased thickness of the lens ( t ) increases magnification and decreases minification. Increased lens power ( D v ) leads to increased magnification for plus lenses and minification for minus lenses.

        "content": "The dimethylamine salt of 14C-ring-labeled 2,4-D was administered to Fischer 344 rats orally (1 and 0.4 mg/kg body weight) and dermally (10 mg/kg body weight). Absorption, distribution, and elimination were determined from 14C-labeled 2,4-D in blood, tissues, and excreta. Quantitatively, most of the orally administered dose (94-96%) became systemically available within 6 h. Following dermal administration 10% of the dose became systemically available over 72 h. However, peak concentrations in blood and kidneys were achieved within 30 min of dosing by either route. By 1.5 h after dosing, 2,4-D concentrations in blood, muscle, liver, and kidneys had decreased in both the orally dosed and dermally dosed animals. Between 2 and 8 h, the blood, muscle, liver and kidney concentrations in dermally dosed animals maintained a plateau while urinary excretion increased, presumably due to continued absorption of 2,4-D from the skin. The concentrations in orally dosed animals continued to decrease. Following 7 h of dermal exposure, skin cleansing removed about 63% of the applied dose; about 17% of the applied dose remained at the site of dermal dosing. At 8 h, 2,4-D concentrations in blood, muscle, liver, and kidneys of dermally dosed animals began to decrease, most likely a result of the removal of the reservoir on the skin. However, 2,4-D continued to be absorbed from skin site, resulting in a slower decline of the 2,4-D concentrations in these tissues over remainder of the 72-h study period. By comparison, in animals that had been orally dosed, the absorbed dose was almost completely excreted within 24 h.",
