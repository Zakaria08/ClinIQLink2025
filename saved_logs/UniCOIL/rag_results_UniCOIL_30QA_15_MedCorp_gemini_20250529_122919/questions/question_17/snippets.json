        "content": "Two surveys were conducted to determine what roles people actually want to assume in selecting cancer treatments. 436 newly diagnosed cancer patients and 482 members of the general public participated. Preferences were elicited using two card sort procedures, each of which described five potential roles in decision making. Findings suggested that the impact of being diagnosed with a life-threatening illness may influence preferences to participate. The majority (59%) of patients wanted physicians to make treatment decisions on their behalf, but 64% of the public thought they would want to select their own treatment if they developed cancer. Most patients (51%) and members of the public (46%) wanted their physician and family to share responsibility for decision making if they were too ill to participate. Sociodemographic variables accounted for only 15% of variance in preferences. These variables are not particularly useful in making predictions about which groups want more or less active roles in medical decision making.",

Several studies have documented that primary combination chemotherapy with or without involved-field radiation therapy is capable of curing 90% or more of the patients with clinically staged, localized disease. Results with primary radiation therapy in such patients are not nearly as good, even in those who undergo laparotomy staging. The management of advanced-stage disease is more controversial. Although combination chemotherapy is the treatment of choice, there is debate about whether the impressive results with the latest regimens, such as MACOP-B, COP-BLAM III, and ProMACE-CytaBOM, which appear to be curative for around 60% or more of advanced-stage patients, are really superior to CHOP, the most widely used program, which cures about 30% or so of the patients. A major idea that is guiding the development of new treatment programs is augmenting the dose intensity of the treatment. This notion is fueled not only by the demonstrated dose-response relationships that have been documented by Hryniuk and colleagues in other tumor types, such as cancers of the breast, ovary, and colon, but also by recent experience in the salvage therapy of relapsed aggressive lymphoma. Formerly a universally fatal disease, relapsed aggressive lymphoma now appears to be responsive to high-dose chemotherapy with or without radiation therapy followed by autologous or allogeneic bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell reconstitution.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
