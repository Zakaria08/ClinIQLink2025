Document 1 (Title: Anticariogenic effect of fluoridated milk and water in rats.): The aim of the study was to get further experimental data on the anticariogenic effect of sodium fluoride (NaF) when administered in milk or water. Thirty six weanling Osborne-Mendel rats were divided into two experimental groups (A, B) of 12 rats each and two control groups (C, D) of six rats each. During the experimental period of four weeks all animals were superinfected with Strep. mutans (NCTC 10449), kept in an automatic feeding machine and given a cariogenic diet (MIT 301). Group A received sodium fluoride (NaF) in water (15 ppm) and group B in ultra high temperature treated milk. Groups C and D respectively received plain milk and distilled water. Group A did not show significantly lower caries reduction compared with the control groups. Group B had significantly the lowest caries scores compared with all other groups. Scores in group C (plain milk) were lower than those in groups D (plain water). The results suggest that the anticariogenic effect of NaF is more pronounced when the vehicle is milk ins...
Document 2 (Title: Immunology_Janeway): 8.11 Matching: Match the following subsets of murine γ:δ T cells with the appropriate description: A. Dendritic i. Can be divided in two groups: epidermal IFN-γ and IL-4 producing, and IFN-γ T cells producing subsets B. Vγ4+ ii. Cells that home to the reproductive tract, lung, and dermis; upon stimulation these can produce inflammatory cytokines C. Vγ6+ T cells iii. A population of later developing γ:δ T cells programmed to secrete IL-17 when activated, and can be found in all lymphoid organs, as well as the dermis D. Vγ1+ T cells iv. Cells that, as a response to a pathogen or a wound, can induce inflammation, promote wound healing, and produce growth factors; also characterized by their T-cell receptors’ use of the Vγ5 segment E. Vγ7+ T cells v. Specifically home to the intestinal epithelium 8.12 Multiple Choice: Which of the following options correctly describes a difference between the B-cell receptor and the T-cell receptor?
Document 3 (Title: Anatomy, Shoulder and Upper Limb, Hand Compartments -- Nerves -- Brachial Plexus): The rest of the brachial plexus terminal branches arise distally from the cords. They are as follows: Lateral pectoral nerve: arises from the lateral cord Musculocutaneous nerve: branches out from the lateral cord Axillary nerve: emerges inferiorly from the posterior cord Radial nerve: emerges inferiorly from the posterior cord, positioned medial to the axillary nerve Median nerve: arises from the union of the lateral and medial cords Ulnar nerve: branches out from the medial cord Upper and lower subscapular nerves: arise from the posterior cord Medial pectoral nerve: emerges from the medial cord Medial brachial cutaneous nerve: branches out from the medial cord Medial antebrachial cutaneous nerve: arises from the medial cord Thoracodorsal nerve: a branch of the posterior cord A memory aid for the arrangement of the brachial plexus is " R andy T ravis d rinks c old b eer"— r oots, t runks, d ivision, c ords, and b ranches.

Document 4 (Title: Five lemma): So, to prove (1), assume that m and p are surjective and q is injective. Let c′ be an element of C′. Since p is surjective, there exists an element d in D with p(d) = t(c′). By commutativity of the diagram, u(p(d)) = q(j(d)). Since im t = ker u by exactness, 0 = u(t(c′)) = u(p(d)) = q(j(d)). Since q is injective, j(d) = 0, so d is in ker j = im h. Therefore, there exists c in C with h(c) = d. Then t(n(c)) = p(h(c)) = t(c′). Since t is a homomorphism, it follows that t(c′ − n(c)) = 0. By exactness, c′ − n(c) is in the image of s, so there exists b′ in B′ with s(b′) = c′ − n(c). Since m is surjective, we can find b in B such that b′ = m(b). By commutativity, n(g(b)) = s(m(b)) = c′ − n(c). Since n is a homomorphism, n(g(b) + c) = n(g(b)) + n(c) = c′ − n(c) + n(c) = c′. Therefore, n is surjective. Then, to prove (2), assume that m and p are injective and l is surjective.
Document 5 (Title: Vitamin D -- Mechanism of Action): Vitamin D has a physiologic function outside calcium metabolism. Vitamin D receptor is present in the small intestine, colon, T and B lymphocytes, mononuclear cells, brain, and skin. It stimulates insulin production, modulates the function of activated T and B lymphocytes, prevents inflammatory bowel diseases, and affects myocardial contractility.
