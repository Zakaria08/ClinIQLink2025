        "content": "A cohort of 3637 female and 168 male hair-dressers in Finland was followed up for cancer through the Finnish Cancer Registry in 1970-1987. Compared with the total population, the women had a significantly elevated risk (standardized incidence ratio 1.7) during the first third of the observation period, but not thereafter. For the total follow-up period, the relative risks were highest for nonmelanoma skin cancer (2.0), lung cancer (1.7), ovarian cancer (1.6), cervical cancer (1.5), and cancer of the pancreas (1.5); only the risk of ovarian cancer was statistically significant. A decrease in relative risk with time was observed for many primary sites, e.g., pancreas, cervix uteri, central nervous system, and thyroid. The opposite was true for lung and skin: An increased risk was found only in 1982-1987. The excess was most prominent in the oldest age groups with the longest time span since the first employment as a hairdresser. Among men, too, the general cancer risk was highest (1.6) during the first third of the observation period. An excess of cancers of the lung and the pancreas was observed. The small numbers, however, did not allow any further conclusions. The changes in the cancer risk pattern over time may be associated with changes in working conditions in hairdressing salons.",

We, therefore, reviewed our recent experience with infant repair to assess this.

The McGoon ratio (diameter of the right pulmonary artery at the prebranching point plus that of the left divided by the diameter of the aorta at the diaphragm) by cineangiography (n = 48) was between 1.2 and 1.5 in 15 patients, 1.6 and 2.0 in 20, and greater than 2.0 in 13. Transannular patching was performed in 19 of the patients with pulmonary stenosis (36%). Muscle resection was avoided in 29 infants and was minimal in the remaining 29. A weak correlation, with considerable scatter, was found between the McGoon ratio and postrepair right ventricular/left ventricular pressure measured in the operating room (r = 0.4), and the relations were similar to those previously reported for children. Right ventricular/left ventricular pressure was 0.55 +/- 0.03 in infants with McGoon ratios of 1.2-1.5, 0.46 +/- 0.03 with ratios of 1.6-2.0, and 0.47 +/- 0.03 with ratios greater than 2.0 (p = 0.01). There were no hospital deaths, and the 3-year survivorship was 94%. Two infants underwent successful reoperation for residual right ventricular outflow tract obstruction.

We, therefore, reviewed our recent experience with infant repair to assess this. Between January 87 and October 90, repair was performed in 58 infants less than 1 year old (median, 6 months) with tetralogy of Fallot and pulmonary stenosis (n = 53) or pulmonary atresia without important aortopulmonary collaterals (n = 5). The McGoon ratio (diameter of the right pulmonary artery at the prebranching point plus that of the left divided by the diameter of the aorta at the diaphragm) by cineangiography (n = 48) was between 1.2 and 1.5 in 15 patients, 1.6 and 2.0 in 20, and greater than 2.0 in 13. Transannular patching was performed in 19 of the patients with pulmonary stenosis (36%). Muscle resection was avoided in 29 infants and was minimal in the remaining 29. A weak correlation, with considerable scatter, was found between the McGoon ratio and postrepair right ventricular/left ventricular pressure measured in the operating room (r = 0.4), and the relations were similar to those previously reported for children. Right ventricular/left ventricular pressure was 0.55 +/- 0.03 in infants with McGoon ratios of 1.2-1.5, 0.46 +/- 0.03 with ratios of 1.6-2.0, and 0.47 +/- 0.03 with ratios greater than 2.0 (p = 0.01). There were no hospital deaths, and the 3-year survivorship was 94%. Two infants underwent successful reoperation for residual right ventricular outflow tract obstruction. All other patients are free of significant hemodynamic residua.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "content": "This study investigates factors that influence the pressure measured in the intrapericardial (IP) space. Seven dogs were studied after they were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium. With the chest closed, intravascular volume expansion by dextran infusion from a mean left atrial (LA) transmural pressure of 8.4 +/- 1.2 (SD) to 15.5 +/- 1.6 Torr caused an increase in mean IP of from 2.6 +/- 1.2 to 3.9 +/- 1.7 Torr (P less than 0.01). This reflected a predominant increase in the influence of the cardiac fossa (CF), which accounted for 56% of the IP pressure after volume expansion. In the open-chest state an increase in mean LA transmural pressure from 9.5 +/- 2.5 to 16.4 +/- 0.6 Torr caused IP pressure to increase from 1.1 +/- 0.9 to 3.0 +/- 1.6 (P less than 0.005), representing the influence of the elastic pericardium alone. The use of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) significantly increased the influence of the CF. Of note, the relation of LA to right atrial (RA) pressure was significantly different with and without the influence of the CF; the RA-to-LA ratio was higher with the chest open under each set of volume conditions with and without PEEP. In four dogs, acute transection of the pericardiodiaphragmatic ligaments led to a small (1-2 Torr) but distinct drop in IP pressure. Thus, IP pressure is affected by the intracardiac volume, the elastic pericardium, the CF, and the pericardiodiaphragmatic attachments, all of which must be considered in an analysis of diastolic properties of the heart in situ.",
