Document 1 (Title: Catheter Management of Ventricular Septal Defect -- Complications): Arrhythmias : The most common complication of VSD closure. Patients have a 4.6 to 17‰ risk of arrhythmia following device implantation. [6]  While most arrhythmias occur within 1 day to 1-week post-operation, transient atrioventricular block and complete heart block have been noted intraoperatively, with a prevalence of about 1.6%. Common post-operative arrhythmias include right bundle branch block 6.4%, left bundle branch block 1.6%, sinus tachycardia 3.2%, and second atrioventricular block (AVB) 1.09%. [7] The risk of pacemaker dependence is approximately 3.8%, according to Carminatti et al. [8]  There is evidence to support various arrhythmia risks depending on the VSD type. For example, complete heart block seems to occur more often in perimembranous VSD compared to muscular VSDs. [8]
Document 2 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Unburned cured tobacco used orally contains nicotine, carcinogens, and other toxicants capable of causing gum disease, oral and pancreatic cancers, and an increase in the risk of heart disease. When tobacco is burned, the resultant smoke contains, in addition to nicotine, more than 7000 other compounds that result from volatilization, pyrolysis, and pyrosynthesis of tobacco and various chemical additives used in making different tobacco products. The smoke is composed of a fine aerosol and a vapor phase; aerosolized particles are of a size range that results in deposition in the airways and alveolar surfaces of the lungs.

Document 3 (Title: Changing cancer risk pattern among Finnish hairdressers.): A cohort of 3637 female and 168 male hair-dressers in Finland was followed up for cancer through the Finnish Cancer Registry in 1970-1987. Compared with the total population, the women had a significantly elevated risk (standardized incidence ratio 1.7) during the first third of the observation period, but not thereafter. For the total follow-up period, the relative risks were highest for nonmelanoma skin cancer (2.0), lung cancer (1.7), ovarian cancer (1.6), cervical cancer (1.5), and cancer of the pancreas (1.5); only the risk of ovarian cancer was statistically significant. A decrease in relative risk with time was observed for many primary sites, e.g., pancreas, cervix uteri, central nervous system, and thyroid. The opposite was true for lung and skin: An increased risk was found only in 1982-1987. The excess was most prominent in the oldest age groups with the longest time span since the first employment as a hairdresser. Among men, too, the general cancer risk was highest (1.6) during the first third of...
