Document 1 (Title: [Effect of ascorbic acid on 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 metabolism in the kidneys and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 reception in the small intestine mucosa of guinea pigs].): Ascorbic acid deficiency in vitamin D-supplied guinea pigs caused a moderate decrease of Ca in the blood and osseous tissue, a 1.5-fold decrease of 2.5-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OH D) in blood serum, a 2-fold decrease of the 25-OH D 1-hydroxylase activity in kidneys and a 1.6-fold increase of the 24-hydroxylase activity. The concentration of 1.25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1.25-(OH)2D3) nuclear receptors in small intestinal mucosa diminished by 20-30%; in this case the percentage of occupied hormone receptors reduced from 11.8 to 8.6%. The affinity of receptors for 1.25-(OH)2D3 did not change thereby (Kd = 0.25-0.26 nM; Kd2 = 0.06-0.10 nM). At the same time the value of cooperativity coefficient showed a decrease-from 1.7 to 1.4, which was accompanied by a reduction of the maximum capacity of receptors (1.2-1.5-fold). Vitamin C depletion augmented the manifestation of vitamin D deficiency in guinea pigs and impeded their correction after administration of cholecalciferol. This markedly retarded the restoration of the 25...
Document 2 (Title: Phytolacca americana): Nutrition As shown in the sidebar, a 100g serving of pokeweed contains 20 calories and 3.1 grams of carbohydrates, 1.6 grams of sugars, 1.5 grams of dietary fiber, 0.4 grams of fat, 2.3 grams of protein, and is a rich source of vitamin A, vitamin B2, vitamin C, vitamin K, and manganese. It contains low levels of vitamin B1, vitamin B6, iron, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, and potassium. Cultural significance In music A 1969 hit written and performed by Tony Joe White, "Polk Salad Annie", is about poke sallet, the cooked greens-like dish made from pokeweed. The lyrics include:And in the fields looks somethin' like a turnip green And everybody calls it polk salad, polk salad Elvis Presley covered the song.
Document 3 (Title: Biochemistry_Lippinco): Prognosis: The prognosis for recovery is excellent. Case-Related Questions: Choose the ONE best answer. Q1. Which of the following statements about vitamin C is correct? Vitamin C is: A. a competitor of iron absorption in the intestine. B. a fat-soluble vitamin with a 3-month supply typically stored in adipose tissue. C. a coenzyme in several enzymic reactions such as the hydroxylation of proline. D. required for the cross-linking of collagen. Q2. In contrast to the microcytic anemia characteristic of iron deficiency (common in older adults), a macrocytic anemia is seen with deficiencies of vitamin B12 and/or folic acid. These vitamin deficiencies are also common in older adults. Which of the following statements concerning these vitamins is correct? A. An inability to absorb B12 results in pernicious anemia. B. Both vitamins cause changes in gene expression. C. Folic acid plays a key role in energy metabolism in most cells.
Document 4 (Title: Effects of dietary fat, calcium, and vitamin D on growth and mammary tumorigenesis induced by 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene in female Sprague-Dawley rats.): This study was designed to test the influence of dietary calcium and vitamin D levels on the promotional effect of high-fat diets on chemically induced mammary carcinogenesis. In a small preliminary experiment (Experiment A), 40 female Sprague-Dawley rats, 43 days old, were randomly divided into 5 groups (8 rats/group) and fed a semipurified diet containing 3% sunflower seed oil (SF) by weight, 1.5 mg of calcium/kcal and 0.5 IU vitamin D/kcal of diet. After 1 week, each rat was given 2.5 mg of dimethylbenz(a)anthracene by gastric gavage. One week later, the animals were switched to 1 of 4 diets varying in fat (3 or 20% SF by weight), calcium (1.5 or 0.25 mg/kcal), vitamin D (0.5 or 0.05 IU/kcal), and phosphate or to a fifth diet containing 3% SF by weight, 0.1 mg of calcium/kcal and 0.05 IU of vitamin D/kcal. In all 5 diets, calcium:phosphate weight ratios were maintained at 1.2:1. In animals fed the high-fat diet, reduction of dietary calcium (1.5 to 0.25 mg/kcal) and vitamin D (0.5 to 0.05 IU/kcal) increase...
Document 5 (Title: Vitamin D Toxicity -- Epidemiology): According to the latest report from America's Poison Centers (APC), there were 11,718 cases of vitamin D exposure recorded in the National Poison Data System. More than half of these cases were in children younger than 5 years. The vast majority of cases were from unintentional exposures. The total number of vitamin D toxicity cases was greater than the total number of vitamin (vitamins B, A, C, and E) toxicity cases combined. This illustrates the widespread use of vitamin D supplements. [13]
