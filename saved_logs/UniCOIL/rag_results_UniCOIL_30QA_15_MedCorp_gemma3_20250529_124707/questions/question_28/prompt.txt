Document 1 (Title: Hepatitis B -- Treatment / Management -- Management): Acute hepatitis B infection is self cleared in 95% of healthy adults. Management is supportive in a majority of patients. Patients with severe acute disease (2 of the 3: bilirubin more than 10 mg/dl, INR more than 1.6 and hepatic encephalopathy) and protracted acute severe disease (total bilirubin more than 3 mg/dl or direct bilirubin more than 1.5 mg/dl, INR more than 1.5, hepatic encephalopathy, or ascites) need antiviral treatment.
Document 2 (Title: Pharmacokinetics, thrombolytic efficacy and hemorrhagic risk of different streptokinase regimens in heparin-treated acute myocardial infarction.): The systemic activator activity of 4 streptokinase (SK) regimens (250,000 IU intracoronary, group A; 500,000 IU, group B; 1.5 X 10(6) IU, group C; and 30 U anisoylated plasminogen streptokinase activator complex (APSAC) intravenously, group D) was tested with the fibrin plate technique. One hour after initiation of treatment, the activator activity was highest after APSAC (3.6 +/- 0.9 U), slightly but not significantly less after SK 1.5 X 10(6) IU (3.0 +/- 0.7), and significantly less after SK 500,000 IU (1.6 +/- 0.5) and 250,000 IU (0.6 +/- 0.5), p less than 0.001. After SK, activator activity half-lives were 184 minutes (group B) and 169 minutes (group C), and after APSAC 188 minutes (group D). These were all in agreement with greater than 12 hour duration of changes in other markers of systemic fibrinolysis (euglobulin lysis time) and substrates depletion (fibrinogen, plasminogen, alpha 2 antiplasmin). In extended pilot clinical groups given identical thrombolytic regimens during full anticoagulation with ...
Document 3 (Title: Rotational Atherectomy -- Complications): As with all atherectomy devices, complications can arise, and this is not exclusive to rotational atherectomy. Based on multicenter registries and numerous observational studies, these complications include death in approximately 1%, myocardial infarction in 1.2 to 1.3%, and emergency CABG in 1.0% to 2.5% of cases. In addition to the clinical complications, the angiographic complications of RA include artery dissection in (10%), abrupt vessel closure (1.8%), a slow-flow phenomenon (1.2% to 7.6%), perforation (1.5%), and severe spasm (1.6%). Another unique but rare complication of RA is dissection caused by wire bias in the angulated lesion, which can be decreased by bending the guidewire or using a small-size initial burr.
Document 4 (Title: Immunology_Janeway): 1.4 Matching: Classify the following as lymphoid or myeloid in origin: A. eosinophils B. B cells C. neutrophils D. nK cells E. mast cells F. macrophages G. red blood cells 1.5 Multiple Choice: the immunologist’s ‘dirty little secret’ involves the addition of microbial constituents in order to stimulate a strong immune response against the desired protein antigen of interest. Which of the following is not a receptor or receptor family that can recognize microbial products in order to achieve a potent immune response? A. toll-like receptors (tlrs) B. t-cell antigen receptor (tCr) C. nod-like receptors (nlrs) D. Pattern recognition receptors (Prrs) 1.6 True or False: Hematopoietic stem cells can develop into any cell type in the body. 1.7 Matching: match each of the following terms to the numbered phrase that describes it best: A. Allergy __ 1. Immunological response to an antigen present on a transplanted foreign cell
