        "title": "Phosphate transport in isolated rat inner medullary collecting duct.",
        "content": "Phosphate transport by the inner medullary collecting duct of normal rats was studied using an in vitro microperfusion technique. Net (Jnet), lumen-to-bath (Jlb) and bath-to-lumen (Jbl) phosphate fluxes were measured using 32PO4 as tracer, in the absence of net water absorption. A net absorption of phosphate (22.3 +/- 3.3 pmol cm-2 s-1) was observed by direct determination, and was similar to the difference between the Jlb and Jbl (57.7 +/- 8.2 and 32.2 +/- 1.5 pmol cm-2 s-1 respectively). The addition of amiloride (10 microM) to the perfusate did not change the Jlb of phosphate but blocked the efflux of sodium. Also, the withdrawal of sodium from the bath and perfusion solution did not change the Jlb of phosphate. In parallel, the addition of ouabain (10 mM) to the bath fluid decreased the Jlb of sodium more (37%) than the Jlb of phosphate (12%) and did not change the Jbl of phosphate. The addition of arsenate (10 microM) to the perfusate both in the presence and in the absence of sodium caused a decrease in Jlb, but Jbl remained unchanged, and parathyroid hormone (10 U) added to the bath did not change the Jlb. The increase in pH of the bath and perfusion fluid was associated with an increase in the Jlb of phosphate, and the decrease in pH was similarly followed by a decrease in phosphate efflux. The Jbl did not change with the pH alterations. These data demonstrate that a net phosphate absorption takes place in rat inner medullary collecting duct perfused in vitro and that this transport appears to be independent of sodium absorption and the action of parathyroid hormone. Moreover, a decrease in luminal and bath pH induces a decrease in phosphate efflux.",

        "content": "CYP enzymes consist of an active site made of a heme-iron center. The iron compound is bound to the protein by a cysteine thiolate molecule. Substrate(s) bind to the active site at the heme group, which induces a conformational change of the enzyme's active site. Reductases are then responsible for electron transfer from NAD(P)H. Oxygen binds to the ferrous-heme group following the reduction of iron. Another electron is added via reduction, creating a Fe-O2 group known as a peroxide state. The peroxide group is short-lived as it gets protonated twice to release water and another compound known as P450 Compound 1 (FeO3+). This activity allows for the acquisition of the necessary and further hydroxylated to a more excretable, hydrophilic compound. In general, the result of the mechanism appears as such: O2 + NAD(P)H + H+ + RH → NAD(P)+ + H2O + ROH",
        "contents": "Biochemistry, Cytochrome P450 -- Mechanism. CYP enzymes consist of an active site made of a heme-iron center. The iron compound is bound to the protein by a cysteine thiolate molecule. Substrate(s) bind to the active site at the heme group, which induces a conformational change of the enzyme's active site. Reductases are then responsible for electron transfer from NAD(P)H. Oxygen binds to the ferrous-heme group following the reduction of iron. Another electron is added via reduction, creating a Fe-O2 group known as a peroxide state. The peroxide group is short-lived as it gets protonated twice to release water and another compound known as P450 Compound 1 (FeO3+). This activity allows for the acquisition of the necessary and further hydroxylated to a more excretable, hydrophilic compound. In general, the result of the mechanism appears as such: O2 + NAD(P)H + H+ + RH → NAD(P)+ + H2O + ROH"

        "title": "Alternatives to hexachlorophene bathing of newborn infants.",
        "content": "In controlled trials newborn infants were bathed with Lactacyd, pHisoHex, Hibitane, Lanohex or tap water. Bacteriologic samples were taken from three sites (groin, axilla and cord) immediately after birth, following an initial bath with one of the test agents, and on day 3 or 5 after a water bath. Initial bathing with all agents, including water, reduced the concentration of bacteria on the skin to a similar extent. However, comparisons of bacterial flora at birth versus those on days 3 and 5 indicated differences in the actions of the various agents on pathogenic and nonpathogenic organisms. Lactacyd and Hibitane appeared to be suitable alternatives to hexachlorophene in the control of pathogenic bacteria on the skin of newborns. However, their absorption and toxicity in the newborn are unknown and, unless use of a skin disinfectant is warranted, routine bathing of newborns with tap water appears to be satisfactory.",
