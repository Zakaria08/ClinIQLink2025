        "content": "The SCC-25 cell line is a well-established line derived from a human squamous carcinoma of the head and neck. The capacity of this cell line for recovery from potentially lethal damage following X-ray treatment has been documented. The survival curve of stationary phase SCC-25 cells exposed to various concentrations of bleomycin is biphasic with an initial sensitive phase and a less sensitive second phase as is common for many cell lines. Stationary phase SCC-25 cells were exposed to 100 mU ml-1 of bleomycin for 1 h. The drug was removed and the cells were allowed various periods to recover from potentially lethal damage. After 24 h, the SCC-25 cells showed a recovery ratio (R/R0) of 7.0 which corresponded to an immediate survival at a drug level of 27 mU ml-1, a dose 3.7-fold less than the exposure concentration of 100 mU ml-1. Over the course of the first 4 h following bleomycin exposure, 0.5 microM CDDP was a very effective inhibitor of potentially lethal damage repair, giving a R/R0 of 1.1 or nearly complete inhibition of recovery. Between 2 and 4 h the R/R0 was 1.6-1.8 with CDDP and 4.1-5.3 without CDDP indicating appreciable inhibition of recovery. Plant (10 microM) and Plato (10 microM) produced potentially lethal damage recovery inhibition patterns very similar to that of CDDP. After 1 h the recovery ratios in the presence of Plant and Plato were 1.1-1.3. Between 2 and 4 h, Plato and Plant gave recovery ratios of 1.8-2.3 and 1.6-1.9, respectively. NIPt and Pt(terpy) were examined at both 10 microM and 25 microM for their ability to inhibit potentially lethal damage recovery after bleomycin treatment. After 1 h, NIPt gave a recovery ratio of 1.3-1.4, and after 2-4 h the recovery ratio was 1.7-2.6. Pt(terpy) gave recovery ratios of 1.3-1.6 after 1 h and 1.5-1.8 after 24 h.",

        "title": "Monoclonal antibodies as probes to investigate the molecular changes of C5 associated with the different stability of the molecule on sheep erythrocytes and Escherichia coli 0111:B4.",
        "content": "The fifth C component (C5) exhibits a different stability when bound to sheep E or Escherichia coli 0111:B4, being fairly stable on the bacterial intermediate sensitized E. coli 0111:B4 coated with C components up to C5 (BAC1-5) and extremely labile on the RBC intermediate sensitized sheep E coated with C components up to C5 (EAC1-5). We examined the possibility that molecular changes of membrane-bound C5 might be responsible for the different functional behavior of the two intermediates using mAb to C5 and sensitive immunoassays to detect bound C5. The decay of EAC1-5 over 30 min of incubation at 37 degrees C was associated with a significant drop in the reactivity of bound C5 with three of four mAb used. These results contrasted with those obtained with BAC1-5, which showed unchanged reactivity with all mAb tested over the same period of incubation. The effect of mAb on the activity of C5 was then investigated in an attempt to relate the change of the reactivity pattern of EAC1-5 with the functional modification of bound C5. MAb 1.5 and 1.6 were the only antibodies that interfered with the functional activity of C5, although through a different mechanism. In particular, mAb 1.5 was active both on fluid-phase and on membrane-bound C5 and is therefore likely to interact with the binding site for the late components on C5. Conversely, mAb 1.6 was only effective on fluid-phase C5 and acted by promoting a decay of BAC1-5 similar to the spontaneous decay of EAC1-5. We suggest that the bacterial outer membrane may protect C5 from functional decay and that mAb 1.6 interferes with the stabilizing effect of the bacteria in an as yet unclear manner.",

        "content": "Using a radiolabelled bran preparation, a large field of view gamma-camera and a computer, a method has been developed to define and analyse the gastrointestinal transit profile of solids. Unprocessed bran, labelled with technetium (99mTc) sulphur colloid is incorporated into biscuits cooked in a microwave oven. With this preparation, less than 3.4% of the isotope dissociated from the bran in a gastric milieu, and more than 90% of recovered radionuclide activity, were retained with the solid phase during small intestinal transit in subjects with stable ileostomy function. A normal range for gastric emptying (GE), small intestinal transit (IT) and colonic filling (CF) was established in 15 healthy volunteers. Anterior and posterior images were taken until all isotope was present in the colon. Using regions of interest for the stomach and colon, decay corrected geometric mean curves for GE and CF were generated. GE was characterized by a lag phase followed by a linear emptying phase. The GE profile (mean and standard deviation) was described by 'power exponential' parameters of half-emptying time (1.6 +/- 0.4 h) and beta (1.5 +/- 0.2). The IT time was 3.9 +/- 1.5 h. The onset of CF was determined visually (4.1 +/- 1.5 h), and the time of 50% CF filling was determined from the colonic filling curve (5.5 +/- 1.4 h). This technique should provide a useful, practical, clinical and research test to study the pathophysiology and pharmacology of intestinal motor disorders.",

The conduction velocity was measured on the day following each exposure period, and again, three and six months after the last day of exposure. The majority of exposed rats showed a reduction in conduction velocity on the day after exposure: the extent of this reduction was dependent on the CS2 concentration and the duration of exposure.
