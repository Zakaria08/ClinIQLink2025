The levels of hydroperoxides are increased 1.63-, 2.64-, 4.07-, and 4.31-fold 18 h after one, two, three, or four applications of TPA at 24-h intervals, respectively. The hydroperoxide response to TPA observed in whole skin reflects almost entirely the increased hydroperoxide-producing activity of the epidermis. Such hydroperoxide responses are triggered to various degrees by the anthrone derivatives and the phorbol esters and diterpene with complete and/or stage 2 tumor-promoting activities but not by the agents with only inflammatory, hyperplastic or stage 1 tumor-promoting activities. However, the Ca2+ ionophores A23187 and ionomycin are potent inducers of hydroperoxide formation. Several discrepancies are observed between the hydroperoxide response to TPA and the known effects of the tumor promoter on ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) induction. In contrast to the refractory state against ODC induction caused by TPA treatments repeated at intervals of less than 48 h, the time interval required for recovery of the hydroperoxide response to TPA in TPA-pretreated skins is only 5 h. The stimulatory effects of A23187, ionomycin and various diacylglycerols (DAGs) on hydroperoxide production do not correlate with their ODC-inducing activities. The increasing susceptibilities of C57BL/6, CF-1, and SEN-CAR mice to skin tumor promotion correlate with their hydroperoxide responses but not with their ODC responses to TPA. alpha-Difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) and other inhibitors of TPA-induced ODC activity fail to alter hydroperoxide production whereas the compounds that inhibit the hydroperoxide response to TPA, such as fluocinolone acetonide, have no or only minimal inhibitory activity against ODC induction. This would suggest that the hydroperoxide response to TPA does not require ODC induction and may not be essential for ODC induction. The hydroperoxide response to TPA is mimicked, but to a lesser degree, by the activator of protein kinase C, 1,2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycerol, and inhibited by verapamil, trifluoperazine, and palmitoylcarnitine. Populations of TPA-treated keratinocytes, therefore, may be responsible not only for ODC activation but also for hydroperoxide production.

        "contents": "Mannan-binding lectin. Structural mutations in exon 1 of the human MBL2 gene, at codon 52 (Arg to Cys, allele D), codon 54 (Gly to Asp, allele B) and codon 57 (Gly to Glu, allele C), also independently reduce the level of functional serum MBL by disrupting the collagenous structure of the protein. Furthermore, several nucleotide substitutions in the promoter region of the MBL2 gene at position −550 (H/L polymorphism), −221 (X/Y polymorphism) and −427, −349, −336, del (−324 to −329), −70 and +4 (P/Q polymorphisms) affect the MBL serum concentration. Both the frequency of structural mutations and the promoter polymorphisms that are in strong linkage disequilibrium vary among ethnic groups resulting in seven major haplotypes: HYPA, LYQA, LYPA, LXPA, LYPB, LYQC and HYPD. Differences in the distribution of these haplotypes are the major cause of interracial variations in MBL serum levels. Both HYPA and LYQA are high-producing haplotypes, LYPA intermediate-producing haplotype and LXPA low-producing haplotype,",

        "content": "AMD affects more than 50 million individuals worldwide and is the leading cause of blindness in the elderly in developed countries. [25] This slowly progressive, degenerative ophthalmological disease of the retina usually manifests after 60 years of age. The prevailing hypothesis is that an overly exuberant inflammatory response, driven by an inadequately regulated complement cascade, significantly contributes to the pathophysiology of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Reduced levels of H and B factors are associated with age-related macular degeneration. Mutations in HTRA1 and CFH genes, encoding the complement regulatory factors H and B, can significantly increase the risk of AMD. [26] Under normal physiological conditions, factor H inhibits the inflammatory  response, converting C3b to an inactive iC3b form, and also weakens the binding of C3b with factor B. The point mutation in the CFH gene decreases the affinity of its product – -factor H to CRP (C-reactive protein), which probably reduces the complement activity regulation in the eye fundus and leads to pathological inflammation in the macula.",

PCSK9 is a secreted protein that binds to the extracellular domain of the LDL receptor in the liver and promotes the degradation of the receptor.

Such mutations are particularly frequent in individuals of African descent. Individuals who are heterozygous for a loss-of-function mutation in PCSK9 have an ~30–40% reduction in plasma levels of LDL-C and have a substantial protection from CHD relative to those without a PCSK9 mutation, presumably due to having lower plasma cholesterol levels since birth.
