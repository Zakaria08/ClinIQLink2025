These compounds are derived from the periwinkle plant Catharanthus roseus , formerly known as Vinca rosea . [1] Vincristine has a complex polycyclic structure comprising 3 rings, a structural feature crucial for its biological activity. This drug inhibits cell growth by halting mitosis and disrupting the polymerization of microtubules. Microtubules play a vital role in cell division, intracellular transport, and maintaining cellular shape. Vincristine binds to the tubulin protein, the building block of microtubules, and prevents its polymerization into microtubules. [2] This disrupts the formation of the mitotic spindle, which is essential for chromosome segregation during cell division. Consequently, vincristine induces cell cycle arrest and triggers apoptosis (cell death) in rapidly dividing cancer cells.",

        "content": "Transformation of a mesophyll cell into a viable protoplast that is able to re-enter the cell cycle, divide and further differentiate into organs, is accompanied by a very rapid and important increase in ubiquitin gene expression. Three major size classes of ubiquitin mRNA transcripts were observed in protoplasts as soon as they were isolated and incubated in their culture medium. The 1.6 kb mRNAs were expressed in response to the stress caused by the isolation procedure. They decreased after a few hours of incubation in the culture medium. The 1.9 kb and the 1.3 kb mRNAs enhanced in protoplasts were also observed in young leaves and in actively dividing cells: they appeared to be developmental-stage specific. They are not expressed in response to the stress, but may be considered to be part of the dedifferentiation program induced in protoplasts. These results suggest, as the enhancement of ubiquitin gene expression coincides with the dramatic changes in gene expression observed in protoplasts, that ubiquitin may play a fundamental role in the process of cellular dedifferentiation.",

        "content": "Programmed cell death (PCD) is a fundamental component of development in virtually all animals. Despite the ubiquity of this phenomenon, little is known about what tells a cell to die, and less still about the physiological and molecular mechanisms that bring about death. One system that has proven to be very amenable for the study of PCD is the intersegmental muscle (ISM) of the tobacco hawkmoth Manduca sexta. These giant muscle cells are used during the eclosion (emergence) behavior of the adult moth, and then die during the subsequent 30 h. This review uses the ISMs as a model system to address questions that are basic to any cell death system, including the following: (1) how do cells know when to die; (2) what physiological changes accompany death; (3) what are the molecular mechanisms that mediate death; and (4) do all cells die by the same process? For the ISMs, the trigger for PCD is a decline in the circulating titer of the insect molting hormone, 20-hydroxyecdysone (20-HE). During cell death there are rapid decreases in both the myofibrillar sensitivity to intracellular calcium and the resulting force of fiber contraction. The ability of the ISMs to undergo PCD requires the repression and activation of specific genes. Two of the repressed genes encode actin and myosin. One of the upregulated presumptive cell-death genes encodes polyubiquitin, which appears to play a critical role in the rapid proteolysis that accompanies ISM death.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "content": "Two transgenic tobacco lines were genetically engineered to contain chimaeric genes encoding the glutamine synthetase (GS) gamma polypeptide of Phaseolus vulgaris (French bean), expressed from the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter. One (MIT-1) contained two copies of a construct including the first 60 amino acids of the Nicotiana plumbaginifolia beta-F1 ATPase to target the GS polypeptide to the mitochondrion. The other (CYT-4) contained a single copy of a cytosolic GS construct. Leaves of in vitro plantlets expressed the constructs and contained a novel GS polypeptide, which assembled into active GS isoenzymes constituting about 25% of the total GS activity. In in vitro plantlets of MIT-1, but not CYT-4, the novel polypeptide was found to be associated with the mitochondria. Moreover in MIT-1, the size of the novel polypeptide was not that predicted of the precursor (44.9 kDa) but was about 39 kDa, the same size as the authentic GS gamma polypeptide in CYT-4. These results are consistent with the precursor being imported into the mitochondria and cleaved near the fusion junction between the two sequences. These experiments have therefore shown that the presequence of the beta-F1 ATPase has successfully targeted the GS gamma polypeptide to the mitochondria of transgenic tobacco where it has assembled into an active isoenzyme. However, in fully regenerated plants growing photoautotrophically in growth-room conditions, although the constructs were still expressed, the gamma polypeptide did not accumulate to the same levels as in in vitro plantlets and new isoenzyme activities were now barely detectable. Moreover in leaves of the mature MIT-1 plants, the gamma polypeptide was found to be associated with the insoluble fraction of the mitochondria. The results of these experiments are discussed.",
