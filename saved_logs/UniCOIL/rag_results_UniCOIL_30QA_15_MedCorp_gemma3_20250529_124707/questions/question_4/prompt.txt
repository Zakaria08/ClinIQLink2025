Document 1 (Title: Growth hormone): Because polypeptide hormones are not fat-soluble, they cannot penetrate cell membranes. Thus, GH exerts some of its effects by binding to receptors on target cells, where it activates the MAPK/ERK pathway. Through this mechanism GH directly stimulates division and multiplication of chondrocytes of cartilage. GH also stimulates, through the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, the production of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1, formerly known as somatomedin C), a hormone homologous to proinsulin. The liver is a major target organ of GH for this process and is the principal site of IGF-1 production. IGF-1 has growth-stimulating effects on a wide variety of tissues. Additional IGF-1 is generated within target tissues, making it what appears to be both an endocrine and an autocrine/paracrine hormone. IGF-1 also has stimulatory effects on osteoblast and chondrocyte activity to promote bone growth.
Document 2 (Title: Physiology, Pituitary Hormones -- Mechanism -- Growth Hormone): Growth Hormone has a direct and indirect mechanism of action. The direct effect of growth hormone involves growth hormone directly binding to its receptors on target cells to stimulate a response. The indirect effect is mediated by the action of insulin-like growth factor-1(IGF-1), which is secreted by the liver hepatocytes in response to growth hormone. Insulin-like growth factor-1 binds to its receptor, IGF-1R, on the cellular surface. It activates a tyrosine kinase-mediated intracellular signaling pathway that phosphorylates various proteins intracellularly, leading to increased anabolism, cellular replication and division, and metabolism.

Document 3 (Title: Expression of a G protein subunit, alpha i-1, in Balb/c 3T3 cells leads to agonist-specific changes in growth regulation.): Cellular receptors for many hormones, neurotransmitters, and growth factors are coupled to intracellular effector enzymes or ion channels through a set of heterotrimeric G proteins. In order to determine whether isoforms of G protein alpha subunits contribute differentially to mitogenic responses, we introduced an alpha subunit isoform, alpha i-1, into Balb/c 3T3 cells that normally lack this subtype. Balb/c 3T3 cells transfected with a plasmid containing cDNA encoding alpha i-1 expressed the alpha i-1 protein as judged both by the appearance of immunoreactive alpha i-1 protein on Western blots and by two-dimensional analysis of the proteins [32P]ADP-ribosylated by pertussis toxin. The amount of alpha i-1 expressed is less than the amount of alpha subunits endogenously present in these cells. Expression of alpha i-1 in the transfected cells slightly blunts stimulation of adenylylcyclase by GTP, guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate, or forskolin, but has no major effect on the ability of thrombin to inhibit the...
Document 4 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): 38-8. Thyroid follicular cell showing the major signaling pathways involved in thyroid cell growth and function and key steps in thy-roid hormone synthesis. The basal membrane of the cell in contact with the circulation and its apical surface contact the thyroid follicle. Thy-roid hormone synthesis is initiated by the binding of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) to the TSH receptor (TSHR), a G-protein–coupled transmembrane receptor, on the basal membrane. Activation leads to an increase in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), phosphorylation of protein kinase A (PKA), and activation of target cytosolic and nuclear proteins. The protein kinase C (PKC) pathway is stimulated at higher doses of TSH. Iodide is actively transported into the cell via the Na/I symporter (NIS) and flows down an electrical gradient to the apical membrane. There, thyroid peroxidase (TPO) oxidizes iodide and iodinated tyrosyl residues on thyroglobulin (Tg) in the presence of peroxide (H2O2). Monoand
Document 5 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): signaling cascades mediated by receptor-associated JAK tyrosine kinases and STATs (see Chapter 2). The hormone has complex effects on growth, body composition, and carbohydrate, protein, and lipid metabolism. The growth-promoting effects are mediated principally, but not solely, through an increase in the production of IGF-I. Much of the circulating IGF-I is produced by the liver. Growth hormone also stimulates production of IGF-I in bone, cartilage, muscle, kidney, and other tissues, where it has autocrine or paracrine roles. It stimulates longitudinal bone growth until the epiphyseal plates fuse—near the end of puberty. In both children and adults, GH has anabolic effects in muscle and catabolic effects in adipose cells that shift the balance of body mass to an increase in muscle mass and a reduction in adiposity. The direct and indirect effects of GH on carbohydrate metabolism are mixed, in part because GH and IGF-I have opposite effects on insulin sensitivity. Growth hormone
