Thus, GH exerts some of its effects by binding to receptors on target cells, where it activates the MAPK/ERK pathway. Through this mechanism GH directly stimulates division and multiplication of chondrocytes of cartilage. GH also stimulates, through the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, the production of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1, formerly known as somatomedin C), a hormone homologous to proinsulin. The liver is a major target organ of GH for this process and is the principal site of IGF-1 production. IGF-1 has growth-stimulating effects on a wide variety of tissues. Additional IGF-1 is generated within target tissues, making it what appears to be both an endocrine and an autocrine/paracrine hormone. IGF-1 also has stimulatory effects on osteoblast and chondrocyte activity to promote bone growth.",

        "content": "Cellular receptors for many hormones, neurotransmitters, and growth factors are coupled to intracellular effector enzymes or ion channels through a set of heterotrimeric G proteins. In order to determine whether isoforms of G protein alpha subunits contribute differentially to mitogenic responses, we introduced an alpha subunit isoform, alpha i-1, into Balb/c 3T3 cells that normally lack this subtype. Balb/c 3T3 cells transfected with a plasmid containing cDNA encoding alpha i-1 expressed the alpha i-1 protein as judged both by the appearance of immunoreactive alpha i-1 protein on Western blots and by two-dimensional analysis of the proteins [32P]ADP-ribosylated by pertussis toxin. The amount of alpha i-1 expressed is less than the amount of alpha subunits endogenously present in these cells. Expression of alpha i-1 in the transfected cells slightly blunts stimulation of adenylylcyclase by GTP, guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate, or forskolin, but has no major effect on the ability of thrombin to inhibit the enzyme. In contrast, the expression of alpha i-1 has significant effects on cell growth and on the mitogenic response to thrombin. The alpha i-1-transfected cells have a doubling time that is twice as long as control cells transfected with the same plasmid without a cDNA insert. Despite their slower growth, thymidine incorporation in response to thrombin is greater in transfected than in control cells. Thrombin-stimulated DNA synthesis is sensitive to inhibition by pertussis toxin and is 5-fold more sensitive to inhibition by pertussis toxin in transfected cells than in control cells. The changes are receptor-specific since the mitogenic response to platelet-derived growth factor is indistinguishable between control and transfected cells. These studies suggest that the alpha i subunit composition of the cell may have profound effects on its growth and its response to stimulation through a specific cell surface receptor.",

        "content": "Previous results have established that 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-type tumor promoters can alter the properties of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor through activation of protein kinase C. In order to determine whether other, non-TPA-type tumor promoters might similarly influence growth-mediating receptors, we investigated the effect of palytoxin on EGF binding in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts and human epidermal carcinoma (A431) cells. In both cell types, pretreatment with a low dose of palytoxin (1-11 pM) at 37 degrees C causes a decrease in EGF binding. In Swiss 3T3 cells the inhibitory effect is temperature dependent and does not occur at 4 degrees C, indicating that palytoxin is not directly competing with EGF for binding. As assessed by effects on DNA synthesis, palytoxin is not toxic at these concentrations and does not appear to be mitogenic for these cells. Although palytoxin, like phorbol esters, alters EGF binding, its action in Swiss 3T3 cells differs from that of TPA-type tumor promoters in at least 4 respects: (a) the kinetics and dose dependence differ significantly from that of phorbol dibutyrate; (b) the effect is not readily reversible; (c) there is loss of low-affinity as well as high-affinity binding sites; (d) the effect is independent of cellular protein kinase C levels. These results indicate that palytoxin is capable of heterologous regulation of the EGF receptor through a novel mechanism and suggest that certain non-TPA-type tumor promoters as well as TPA-type tumor promoters may act in part through modulation of growth regulatory pathways.",

Moreover, the purified adrenal-secreted IGF-I displaced bound 125I-IGF-I to its adrenal receptors, and pretreatment of adrenal cells with the purified peptide enhanced the acute corticotropin (ACTH)-induced cAMP production as recombinant IGF-I. The basal secretion of IGF-I (6 +/- 1 ng/48 h/10(6) cells) was stimulated 3-, 4.5-, and 9.5-fold by fibroblast growth factor, angiotensin II (A-II), and ACTH, respectively, but not by growth hormone. The stimulatory effects of A-II and ACTH were dose-dependent (ED50 congruent to 2.5 x 10(-8) and 1.5 x 10(-10) M, respectively), and the effects of both hormones were additive. Glucocorticoids were not the mediators of the effect of the two hormones on IGF-I secretion, since inhibition of their steroidogenic action by aminoglutethimide did not significantly modify IGF-I secretion. An immunoreactive IGF-I material was also secreted by mouse adrenal tumor cell line Y-1, but the stimulatory effect of ACTH was only 2-fold, and there was no effect of A-II.

Preterm infants are prone to vitamin deficiencies due to lower stores, increase requirements, and immature metabolic processes. The opposite is also true that these preterm infants are at higher risk for toxicity due to immature and compromised renal function. Fat-soluble vitamins include vitamins A, D, E, and K. Vitamin A (Retinol) is known to play an essential role in the growth and development of skin, eyes, bones, and pulmonary epithelium. It is thus implicated in chronic lung disease, photophobia, abnormal epiphyseal bone growth, and FTT. Vitamin E (tocopherol) has an antioxidant role in iron-induced hemolysis. Vitamin K plays a vital role in coagulation through carboxylation of prothrombin into its active form, thus essential in preventing hemorrhagic disease of the newborn. Vitamin D plays a crucial role in calcium and phosphorus metabolism in conjunction with parathyroid hormone. Vitamin D deficiency is associated with rickets, osteopenia of prematurity, and failure to thrive. Water-soluble vitamins B and C, on the other hand, require daily intake to meet their requirements."

        "content": "Origin GHRH is released from neurosecretory nerve terminals of these arcuate neurons, and is carried by the hypothalamo-hypophyseal portal system to the anterior pituitary gland, where it stimulates growth hormone (GH) secretion by stimulating the growth hormone-releasing hormone receptor. GHRH is released in a pulsatile manner, stimulating similar pulsatile release of GH. In addition, GHRH also promotes slow-wave sleep directly. Growth hormone is required for normal postnatal growth, bone growth, regulatory effects on protein, carbohydrate, and lipid metabolism. Effect GHRH stimulates GH production and release by binding to the GHRH receptor (GHRHR) on cells in the anterior pituitary. Receptor The GHRHR is a member of the secretin family of G protein-coupled receptors, and is located on chromosome 7 in humans. This protein is transmembranous with seven folds, and its molecular weight is approximately 44 kD.",

        "content": "An increase in parathyroid hormone (PTH) level promotes bone resorption and has a demonstrable effect on osteoclast activity, in addition to its effects on osteocytes, described previously. In contrast, calcitonin, secreted by parafollicular cells of the thyroid gland, has a counterbalancing effect, reducing osteoclast activity. PTH has also anabolic effect on bone either through a direct stimulatory effect on osteoblasts or indirectly through a mechanism that requires it to increase activity of osteoclasts. For example, PTH might stimulate bone formation directly by increasing the local production of IGF I or other bone-stimulating growth factors.",

Growth hormone (GH) is a neurohormone expressed primarily by the pituitary gland that has both metabolic and immunomodulatory effects. GH promotes both protein synthe-sis and insulin resistance while enhancing the mobilization of fat stores. GH secretion is upregulated by hypothalamic GH–releasing hormone and downregulated by somatostatin. GH pri-marily exerts its downstream effects through direct interaction with GH receptors and through the enhanced hepatic synthesis of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), an anabolic growth fac-tor that is known to improve the metabolic rate, gut mucosal function, and protein loss after traumatic injury. Less than 5% of IGF-1 circulates free in the plasma, with the remainder bound principally to one of six IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs), the majority to IGFBP-3.",
