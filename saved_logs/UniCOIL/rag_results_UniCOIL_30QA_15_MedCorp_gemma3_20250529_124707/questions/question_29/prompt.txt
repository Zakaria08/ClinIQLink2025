Document 1 (Title: Hepatitis B -- Treatment / Management -- Management): Acute hepatitis B infection is self cleared in 95% of healthy adults. Management is supportive in a majority of patients. Patients with severe acute disease (2 of the 3: bilirubin more than 10 mg/dl, INR more than 1.6 and hepatic encephalopathy) and protracted acute severe disease (total bilirubin more than 3 mg/dl or direct bilirubin more than 1.5 mg/dl, INR more than 1.5, hepatic encephalopathy, or ascites) need antiviral treatment.
Document 2 (Title: 20000 Varuna): Physical characteristics Size and shape As a result of its rapid rotation, the shape of Varuna is deformed into a triaxial ellipsoid. Given the rapid rotation, rare for objects so large, Varuna's shape is described as a Jacobi ellipsoid, with an a/b aspect ratio of around 1.5–1.6 (in which Varuna's longest semi-axis a is 1.5–1.6 times longer than its b semi-axis). Examination of Varuna's light curve has found that the best-fit model for Varuna's shape is a triaxial ellipsoid with the semi-axes a, b, and c in ratios in the range of b/a = 0.63–0.80, and c/a = 0.45–0.52.

Document 4 (Title: Monoclonal antibodies as probes to investigate the molecular changes of C5 associated with the different stability of the molecule on sheep erythrocytes and Escherichia coli 0111:B4.): The fifth C component (C5) exhibits a different stability when bound to sheep E or Escherichia coli 0111:B4, being fairly stable on the bacterial intermediate sensitized E. coli 0111:B4 coated with C components up to C5 (BAC1-5) and extremely labile on the RBC intermediate sensitized sheep E coated with C components up to C5 (EAC1-5). We examined the possibility that molecular changes of membrane-bound C5 might be responsible for the different functional behavior of the two intermediates using mAb to C5 and sensitive immunoassays to detect bound C5. The decay of EAC1-5 over 30 min of incubation at 37 degrees C was associated with a significant drop in the reactivity of bound C5 with three of four mAb used. These results contrasted with those obtained with BAC1-5, which showed unchanged reactivity with all mAb tested over the same period of incubation. The effect of mAb on the activity of C5 was then investigated in an attempt to relate the change of the reactivity pattern of EAC1-5 with the functional modific...
Document 5 (Title: Divergent effects of short term glucocorticoid excess on the gonadotropic and somatotropic axes in normal men.): We investigated the effects of short term glucocorticoid excess on the gonadotropic and somatotropic axes in healthy men. Subjects (n = 5) underwent blood sampling at 10-min intervals for 6 h before and on days 2, 5, and 8 of glucocorticoid treatment, and for 24 h (n = 6) to examine pulsatile LH and GH release before and during dexamethasone administration (1.5 mg orally twice daily for 1 week). In the time-course study, we found significant decreases on day 8 in serum concentrations of estradiol (from 144 +/- 18 to 99 +/- 18 pmol/L), free testosterone (from 105 +/- 10 to 87 +/- 10 pmol/L), and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (from 6.0 +/- 1.6 to 1.7 +/- 0.3 mumol/L; P less than 0.05). Mean serum LH concentrations did not change (baseline, 5.3 +/- 1.2 IU/L; glucocorticoid, 4.2 +/- 0.61 IU/L). The mean plasma somatomedin-C concentration rose from 0.74 +/- 0.08 to 2.0 +/- 0.35 U/mL (P less than 0.05), and the mean serum GH concentration increased from 1.2 +/- 0.90 micrograms/L (basal) to 4.2 +/- 1.5 micrograms/L...
