        "content": "Acetyl phosphate is hydrolyzed by the calcium ATPase of leaky sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles from rabbit skeletal muscle with Km = 6.5 mM and kcat = 7.9 s-1 in the presence of 100 microM calcium (180 mM K+, 5 mM MgSO4, pH 7.0, 25 degrees C). In the absence of calcium, hydrolysis is 6% of the calcium-dependent rate at low and 24% at saturating concentrations of acetyl phosphate. Values of K0.5 for calcium are 3.5 and 2.2 microM (n = 1.6) in the presence of 1 and 50 mM acetyl phosphate, respectively; inhibition by calcium follows K0.5 = 1.6 mM (n approximately 1.1) with 50 mM acetyl phosphate and K0.5 = 0.5 mM (n approximately 1.3) with 1.5 mM ATP. The calcium-dependent rate of phosphoenzyme formation from acetyl phosphate is consistent with Km = 43 mM and kf = 32 s-1 at saturation; decomposition of the phosphoenzyme occurs with kt = 16 s-1. The maximum fraction of phosphoenzyme formed in the steady state at saturating acetyl phosphate concentrations is 43-46%. These results are consistent with kc congruent to 30 s-1 for binding of Ca2+ to E at saturating [Ca2+], to give cE.Ca2, in the absence of activation by ATP. Phosphoenzyme formed from ATP and from acetyl phosphate shows the same biphasic reaction with ADP, rate constants for decomposition that are the same within experimental error, and similar or identical activation of decomposition by ATP. It is concluded that the reaction pathways for acetyl phosphate and ATP in the presence of Ca2+ are the same, with the exception of calcium binding and phosphorylation; an alternative, faster route that avoids the kc step is available in the presence of ATP. The existence of three different regions of dependence on ATP concentration for steady state turnover is confirmed; activation of hydrolysis at high ATP concentrations involves an ATP-induced increase in kt.",

        "content": "The enzyme 3-methylaspartate ammonia-lyase (EC 4.3.1.2) catalyzes the exchange of the C-3 hydrogen of the substrate, (2S,3S)-3-methylaspartic acid, with solvent hydrogen. The mechanism of the exchange reaction was probed using (2S,3S)-3-methylaspartic acid and its C-3-deuteriated isotopomer. Incubations conducted in tritiated water allowed the rate of protium or deuterium wash-out from the substrates to be measured as tritium wash-in. The primary deuterium isotope effects for the exchange under essentially Vmax conditions ( [S] much greater than Km) were 1.6, 1.5, and 1.5 at pH 9.0, 7.6, and 6.5. The deamination reaction, measured spectrophotometrically on the same incubations, showed isotope effects of 1.7, 1.6, and 1.4 at pH 9.0, 7.6, and 6.5, in agreement with the values of DV and D(V/K) reported previously [Botting, N.P., Akhtar, M., Cohen, M.A., &amp; Gani, D. (1988) Biochemistry 27, 2956-2959]. The ratio of the rate of exchange to the rate of deamination, however, varied widely with pH. Together with the identical values of the primary isotope effects for the two reactions, this result indicates that the partition between reaction pathways occurs after the slowest steps in the common part of the reaction coordinate pathway, almost certainly after the cleavage of the C-N bond at the level of the enzyme-ammonia-mesaconic acid complex, and not at the putative carbanion level as was previously suggested. The enzyme requires both K+ and Mg2+ ions for activity, although ammonium ion is also able to bind in the K+ site and act as an activator. Variation of the metal ion concentration alters the magnitude of the primary deuterium isotope effects. The variation of potassium ion concentration causes the most marked changes: at 1.6 mM K+, DV and D(V/K) are 1.7, whereas at 50 mM K+, DV and D(V/K) are reduced to 1.0. The isotope effects are also reduced at low K+ concentration due to the emergence of a slow-acting high K+ affinity monopotassium form of the enzyme. The binding order and role of the metal ion cofactors and their influence in determining the formal mechanism of the reaction is discussed, and the failure of previous workers to observe primary deuterium isotope effects for the deamination process is explained. The product desorption order was tested by product inhibition, alternative product inhibition, and isotope exchange experiments.
