        "content": "Ascorbic acid deficiency in vitamin D-supplied guinea pigs caused a moderate decrease of Ca in the blood and osseous tissue, a 1.5-fold decrease of 2.5-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OH D) in blood serum, a 2-fold decrease of the 25-OH D 1-hydroxylase activity in kidneys and a 1.6-fold increase of the 24-hydroxylase activity. The concentration of 1.25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1.25-(OH)2D3) nuclear receptors in small intestinal mucosa diminished by 20-30%; in this case the percentage of occupied hormone receptors reduced from 11.8 to 8.6%. The affinity of receptors for 1.25-(OH)2D3 did not change thereby (Kd = 0.25-0.26 nM; Kd2 = 0.06-0.10 nM). At the same time the value of cooperativity coefficient showed a decrease-from 1.7 to 1.4, which was accompanied by a reduction of the maximum capacity of receptors (1.2-1.5-fold). Vitamin C depletion augmented the manifestation of vitamin D deficiency in guinea pigs and impeded their correction after administration of cholecalciferol. This markedly retarded the restoration of the 25-OH D level in the blood as well as the number of occupied and unoccupied nuclear receptors for 1.25-(OH)2D3. The experimental results illustrate the effects of ascorbic acid on the vitamin D hormonal system function, which is manifested both at the level of 1.25-(OH)2D3 synthesis in the kidneys and of its receptor binding in target tissues.",

        "content": "This study was designed to test the influence of dietary calcium and vitamin D levels on the promotional effect of high-fat diets on chemically induced mammary carcinogenesis. In a small preliminary experiment (Experiment A), 40 female Sprague-Dawley rats, 43 days old, were randomly divided into 5 groups (8 rats/group) and fed a semipurified diet containing 3% sunflower seed oil (SF) by weight, 1.5 mg of calcium/kcal and 0.5 IU vitamin D/kcal of diet. After 1 week, each rat was given 2.5 mg of dimethylbenz(a)anthracene by gastric gavage. One week later, the animals were switched to 1 of 4 diets varying in fat (3 or 20% SF by weight), calcium (1.5 or 0.25 mg/kcal), vitamin D (0.5 or 0.05 IU/kcal), and phosphate or to a fifth diet containing 3% SF by weight, 0.1 mg of calcium/kcal and 0.05 IU of vitamin D/kcal. In all 5 diets, calcium:phosphate weight ratios were maintained at 1.2:1. In animals fed the high-fat diet, reduction of dietary calcium (1.5 to 0.25 mg/kcal) and vitamin D (0.5 to 0.05 IU/kcal) increased the incidence of mammary lesions from 37 to 75% and the total number of lesions from 4 to 16. A trend toward an increase in lesion weight and total lesion burden was also seen. To confirm these results, the experiment was repeated using the same protocol; 126 rats were divided into 6 groups, treated with dimethylbenz(a)anthracene, and fed the diets as described. A sixth diet was included that contained 20% SF by weight, 0.01 mg of calcium/kcal, and 0.05 IU of vitamin D/kcal. As for Experiment A, in animals fed the high-fat diet, reduction of dietary calcium (1.5 to 0.25 mg/kcal) and vitamin D (0.5 to 0.05 IU/kcal) resulted in an increase in total mammary lesions from 31 to 55, a significant increase in average lesion burden/rat with lesions (1.6 +/- 0.6 to 12 +/- 3 g), and a trend toward increasing weight of lesions. The effect was less obvious in animals fed the low-fat diet where, in both experiments, an increase in the incidence of mammary lesions was observed only when the dietary calcium was reduced from 1.5 to 0.1 mg/kcal.

In the skin, vitamin D3, or cholecalciferol, is synthesized when 7-dehydrocholesterol is exposed to UV-B light from the sun. Vitamin D3 is transferred to the liver to be further metabolized. Through dietary intake, vitamin D3 is absorbed in the small intestine via incorporation into a micelle to enter the intestinal cells and incorporate into chylomicrons to leave the intestinal cells to enter the lymph system and eventually enter circulation the thoracic duct. In the liver, vitamin D3 enters a hepatocyte and is hydroxylated into 25-OH vitamin D3, which is catalyzed by the enzyme 25-hydroxylase. Then, 25-OH vitamin D3 bind to vitamin D-binding protein, or DBP, to leave the hepatocytes and be transported to the kidney for an additional hydroxylation reaction. In the kidney, 25-OH vitamin D3 is hydroxylated to 1,25-(OH)2 vitamin D3, which is catalyzed by the enzyme 1-hydroxylase. 1,25-(OH)2 vitamin D3 is also known as calcitriol, which is considered the active form of vitamin D. 1,25-(OH)2 vitamin D3 bound to DBP is released to the bone, immune cells, and liver cells.

        "contents": "Biochemistry, Nutrients -- Cellular Level -- Vitamin D (Cholecalciferol). Vitamin D is obtained mainly through UV-B-induced production in the skin. A minor amount of vitamin D is obtained through dietary intake. In the skin, vitamin D3, or cholecalciferol, is synthesized when 7-dehydrocholesterol is exposed to UV-B light from the sun. Vitamin D3 is transferred to the liver to be further metabolized. Through dietary intake, vitamin D3 is absorbed in the small intestine via incorporation into a micelle to enter the intestinal cells and incorporate into chylomicrons to leave the intestinal cells to enter the lymph system and eventually enter circulation the thoracic duct. In the liver, vitamin D3 enters a hepatocyte and is hydroxylated into 25-OH vitamin D3, which is catalyzed by the enzyme 25-hydroxylase. Then, 25-OH vitamin D3 bind to vitamin D-binding protein, or DBP, to leave the hepatocytes and be transported to the kidney for an additional hydroxylation reaction. In the kidney, 25-OH vitamin D3 is hydroxylated to 1,25-(OH)2 vitamin D3, which is catalyzed by the enzyme 1-hydroxylase. 1,25-(OH)2 vitamin D3 is also known as calcitriol, which is considered the active form of vitamin D. 1,25-(OH)2 vitamin D3 bound to DBP is released to the bone, immune cells, and liver cells.
