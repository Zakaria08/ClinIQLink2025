        "content": "The aim of the study was to get further experimental data on the anticariogenic effect of sodium fluoride (NaF) when administered in milk or water. Thirty six weanling Osborne-Mendel rats were divided into two experimental groups (A, B) of 12 rats each and two control groups (C, D) of six rats each. During the experimental period of four weeks all animals were superinfected with Strep. mutans (NCTC 10449), kept in an automatic feeding machine and given a cariogenic diet (MIT 301). Group A received sodium fluoride (NaF) in water (15 ppm) and group B in ultra high temperature treated milk. Groups C and D respectively received plain milk and distilled water. Group A did not show significantly lower caries reduction compared with the control groups. Group B had significantly the lowest caries scores compared with all other groups. Scores in group C (plain milk) were lower than those in groups D (plain water). The results suggest that the anticariogenic effect of NaF is more pronounced when the vehicle is milk instead of water.",

        "content": "Production of autoantibodies specific for the Fc region of autologous IgG, called rheumatoid factors (RF), is a characteristic finding in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). To study the requirements regulating the synthesis of these autoantibodies, we have cloned human helper T cells and co-cultured them with purified B cells. To mimic cognate T-B cell interaction, we have used bacterial superantigens that function by cross-linking HLA molecules on the B cell with selected T cell receptor (TCR) molecules expressing a particular polymorphism of the V beta gene segment. Data presented here demonstrate that the staphylococcal enterotoxin D (SE D), but not other bacterial superantigens, exhibits an ability to induce IgM, IgG, and especially RF production, in B cells from RA patients and normal individuals. Comparison with the polyclonal antibody production in B cell cultures driven by anti-CD3-stimulated T cell clones confirmed that SE D shifted the repertoire of secreted antibodies toward immunoglobulins with Fc binding specificity, suggesting that SE D preferentially stimulates RF+ B lymphocytes. B cells with the potential to secrete RF were highly frequent in RA patients, requiring as few as 150 peripheral B cells/culture to detect RF in the culture supernatants. SE D-induced RF synthesis was strictly dependent on the presence of selected CD4+T helper cells and required a direct membrane contact between B cells and T helper cells. Here, we propose a model that SE D selectively induces RF production depending on the availability of SE D responsive T cells in the TCR repertoire of the responder.",

The purpose of the measurements was to clarify the origin of the S-T shift in acute ischemia and infarction. Previous measurements, consisting of d-c electrograms recorded from the exposed epicardial surface in situ, are partially inconsistent; also, they are not necessarily representative of the surface electrocardiogram (ECG), which sums broadly over the myocardium. The d-c MCG allows steady myocardial currents in the intact torso to the measured externally; because the d-c MCG sums broadly over these currents, conclusions drawn from it are applicable to the ECG. Coronary artery occlusion was produced by inflating a tube which, about 1 week earlier, had been surgically installed around the artery and exteriorized. During occlusions carried out in the MIT magnetically shielded room, a sensitive magnetometer recorded the d-c MCG at various locations around the torso. Within 20 seconds after occlusion, equal and opposite S-T segment and base-line (d-c) shifts appeared on the d-c MCG; these shifts were maintained for at least 15 minutes, after which they slowly decreased.

        "content": "We have measured plasma luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), testosterone (To) by radioimmunoassay (RIA) and bioactive LH (B-LH) by in vitro bioassay at 10-min intervals over 6 h in men treated by haemodialysis for renal failure and in men after renal transplantation. Eleven normal male volunteers acted as controls. Immunoreactive LH (I-LH) and FSH levels were elevated (p less than 0.03) in uraemia (mean +/- SE; 10.0 +/- 1.0 and 4.6 +/- 0.7 IU/l for LH and FSH, respectively) and following renal transplantation (8.1 +/- 1.2 and 5.3 +/- 0.5 IU/l) compared to controls (C) 4.9 +/- 0.5 and 2.7 +/- 0.4 IU/l) whereas B-LH [17.3 +/- 2.5, 14.8 +/- 1.8 and 12.9 +/- 1.3 IU/l in dialysis (D), transplant (T) and C groups, respectively] levels were normal. Prolactin levels were elevated (p less than 0.03) in the D group (median 348, range 162-1,780 mU/l) compared to the T group (161, 91-206 mU/l) and controls (163, 124-312 mU/l) whereas total To levels (mean +/- SE; 17.3 +/- 4.8, 15.5 +/- 1.3 and 19.6 +/- 2.1 nmol/l in the D, T and C groups, respectively) were similar as was the free To index. B-LH (median frequency, 2 and range 1-3 pulses/6 h) and I-LH (median frequency, 2 and range 1-2 pulses/6 h) was pulsatile in all the C group but B- and I-LH pulses were absent in 2 of the 5 subjects treated by dialysis. Following renal transplantation B-LH pulses were detected in all subjects, whilst I-LH pulses were absent in 1 subject.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
