        "content": "The systemic activator activity of 4 streptokinase (SK) regimens (250,000 IU intracoronary, group A; 500,000 IU, group B; 1.5 X 10(6) IU, group C; and 30 U anisoylated plasminogen streptokinase activator complex (APSAC) intravenously, group D) was tested with the fibrin plate technique. One hour after initiation of treatment, the activator activity was highest after APSAC (3.6 +/- 0.9 U), slightly but not significantly less after SK 1.5 X 10(6) IU (3.0 +/- 0.7), and significantly less after SK 500,000 IU (1.6 +/- 0.5) and 250,000 IU (0.6 +/- 0.5), p less than 0.001. After SK, activator activity half-lives were 184 minutes (group B) and 169 minutes (group C), and after APSAC 188 minutes (group D). These were all in agreement with greater than 12 hour duration of changes in other markers of systemic fibrinolysis (euglobulin lysis time) and substrates depletion (fibrinogen, plasminogen, alpha 2 antiplasmin). In extended pilot clinical groups given identical thrombolytic regimens during full anticoagulation with heparin, angiographic coronary patency was found in 83% (35 of 42) after intracoronary SK (group 1), in 73 and 75%, respectively, after 500,000 IU (31 of 43) and 1.5 X 10(6) IU (30 of 40) (group 2 and 3, difference not significant) and 80% (8 of 10) after the 30-U bolus of APSAC (group 4). The overall hemorrhagic risk was 24%, equally distributed among the 4 regimens and mostly (91%) related to catheters. The incidence of bleeding unrelated to vessel puncture was 4%; no deaths occurred. It is concluded that APSAC is the most fibrinolytic regimen but its potential thrombolytic superiority over SK remains to be demonstrated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "content": "The fifth C component (C5) exhibits a different stability when bound to sheep E or Escherichia coli 0111:B4, being fairly stable on the bacterial intermediate sensitized E. coli 0111:B4 coated with C components up to C5 (BAC1-5) and extremely labile on the RBC intermediate sensitized sheep E coated with C components up to C5 (EAC1-5). We examined the possibility that molecular changes of membrane-bound C5 might be responsible for the different functional behavior of the two intermediates using mAb to C5 and sensitive immunoassays to detect bound C5. The decay of EAC1-5 over 30 min of incubation at 37 degrees C was associated with a significant drop in the reactivity of bound C5 with three of four mAb used. These results contrasted with those obtained with BAC1-5, which showed unchanged reactivity with all mAb tested over the same period of incubation. The effect of mAb on the activity of C5 was then investigated in an attempt to relate the change of the reactivity pattern of EAC1-5 with the functional modification of bound C5. MAb 1.5 and 1.6 were the only antibodies that interfered with the functional activity of C5, although through a different mechanism. In particular, mAb 1.5 was active both on fluid-phase and on membrane-bound C5 and is therefore likely to interact with the binding site for the late components on C5. Conversely, mAb 1.6 was only effective on fluid-phase C5 and acted by promoting a decay of BAC1-5 similar to the spontaneous decay of EAC1-5. We suggest that the bacterial outer membrane may protect C5 from functional decay and that mAb 1.6 interferes with the stabilizing effect of the bacteria in an as yet unclear manner.",

        "title": "Effects of dietary fat, calcium, and vitamin D on growth and mammary tumorigenesis induced by 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene in female Sprague-Dawley rats.",
        "content": "This study was designed to test the influence of dietary calcium and vitamin D levels on the promotional effect of high-fat diets on chemically induced mammary carcinogenesis. In a small preliminary experiment (Experiment A), 40 female Sprague-Dawley rats, 43 days old, were randomly divided into 5 groups (8 rats/group) and fed a semipurified diet containing 3% sunflower seed oil (SF) by weight, 1.5 mg of calcium/kcal and 0.5 IU vitamin D/kcal of diet. After 1 week, each rat was given 2.5 mg of dimethylbenz(a)anthracene by gastric gavage. One week later, the animals were switched to 1 of 4 diets varying in fat (3 or 20% SF by weight), calcium (1.5 or 0.25 mg/kcal), vitamin D (0.5 or 0.05 IU/kcal), and phosphate or to a fifth diet containing 3% SF by weight, 0.1 mg of calcium/kcal and 0.05 IU of vitamin D/kcal. In all 5 diets, calcium:phosphate weight ratios were maintained at 1.2:1. In animals fed the high-fat diet, reduction of dietary calcium (1.5 to 0.25 mg/kcal) and vitamin D (0.5 to 0.05 IU/kcal) increased the incidence of mammary lesions from 37 to 75% and the total number of lesions from 4 to 16. A trend toward an increase in lesion weight and total lesion burden was also seen. To confirm these results, the experiment was repeated using the same protocol; 126 rats were divided into 6 groups, treated with dimethylbenz(a)anthracene, and fed the diets as described. A sixth diet was included that contained 20% SF by weight, 0.01 mg of calcium/kcal, and 0.05 IU of vitamin D/kcal. As for Experiment A, in animals fed the high-fat diet, reduction of dietary calcium (1.5 to 0.25 mg/kcal) and vitamin D (0.5 to 0.05 IU/kcal) resulted in an increase in total mammary lesions from 31 to 55, a significant increase in average lesion burden/rat with lesions (1.6 +/- 0.6 to 12 +/- 3 g), and a trend toward increasing weight of lesions. The effect was less obvious in animals fed the low-fat diet where, in both experiments, an increase in the incidence of mammary lesions was observed only when the dietary calcium was reduced from 1.5 to 0.1 mg/kcal. These data suggest that decreasing calcium and vitamin D increase the promoting effects of a high-fat diet on mammary tumorigenesis in the rat.",
