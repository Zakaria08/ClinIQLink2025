Document 1 (Title: Gynecology_Novak): Initial dose 80-U/kg bolus, then 18 U/kg/h The APTT should be measured every 6 h and the heparin dose adjusted as follows: APTT <35 seconds (<1.2 × control) 80-U/kg bolus, then 4 U/kg/h APTT 35–45 seconds (1.2–1.5 × control) 40-U/kg bolus, then 2 U/kg/h APTT 46–70 seconds (1.5–2.3 × control) No change APTT 71–90 seconds (2.3–3 × control) Decrease infusion rate by 2 U/kg/h APTT >90 seconds (>3 × control) Hold infusion for 1 h, then decrease infusion rate by 3 U/kg/h APTT, activated partial thromboplastin time.

Document 2 (Title: Evaluation of Visual Acuity -- Technique or Treatment -- Other Visual Acuity Testing Charts): Letters: When all letters are used, the chance of randomly guessing the correct letter is low (1/26 or around 4%). The ETDRS chart uses Sloan letters, named after Louise Sloan. There are 10 Sloan letters, and the guess rate is 1/10, or 10%. The Sloan letters include C, D, H, K, N, O, R, S, V, and Z. The characteristics of the Sloan letter include equal difficulty in recognition of each letter compared to the Landolt C chart. The Bailey-Lovie chart used the British set of 10 letters, and the guess rate is 10%. These letters are D, E, F, H, N, P, R, U, V, and Z. Numbers Other optotypes, primarily used for children, include Allen pictures and symbols.
Document 3 (Title: Platelet hypersensitivity to serotonin after prolonged ketanserin intake?): In the present study the effect of acute and short-term ketanserin administration on serotonin (5-HT)-induced aggregation was investigated in eight healthy volunteers. They received 40 mg ketanserin three times a day for 1 week. Blood samples were drawn before (A), 1.5 h after the first dose (B), 12 h after the evening dose of the 7th day (C), and 1.5 h after the morning dose of the 8th day (D). The maximal rate of aggregation (mm/min +/- SEM) was significantly decreased following the first dose (A: 47.6 +/- 6.0; B: 27.6 +/- 4.5; p less than 0.05); 12 h after the evening dose of the 7th day, the platelets aggregated more rapidly with 5-HT than before the onset of the study (C: 69.4 +/- 6.0; A vs. p less than 0.01). The last dose of ketanserin abolished this hyperresponsiveness (D: 46.1 +/- 7.58; C vs. D, p less than 0.05); however, there was no significant difference in the velocity of aggregation between the onset of the study and after the last dose. It appears that ketanserin has a double effect on platele...
Document 4 (Title: Plasma lipoprotein distribution of apolipoprotein(a) in the fed and fasted states.): In order to quantitate the contribution of triglyceride-rich lipoprotein (TRL) apolipoprotein(a) to total plasma apo(a) concentration in the fed and fasted states, we have studied a group of 20 male subjects (age 49 +/- 3 years) with fasting apo(a) concentrations varying from 39 to 1385 U/l. After a 12-h overnight fast, each subject was given a fat-rich meal (1 g fat/kg body weight) and venous blood samples were obtained at hourly intervals for 10 h. TRL were isolated from bihourly plasma samples by ultracentrifugation (d less than 1.006 g/ml) and apo(a) was measured by radioimmunoassay. Total plasma apo(a) concentration did not change after the meal. However, TRL apo(a) increased significantly (0 h: 3 +/- 1, 4 h: 30 +/- 7 U/l; p less than 0.001) and 'd greater than 1.006' apo(a) decreased (0 h: 267 +/- 56, 4 h: 231 +/- 50 U/l; P less than 0.05). Similar postprandial changes were observed in apoB concentration (TRL apo B at 0 h: 10.3 +/- 1.5, 4 h: 13.6 +/- 1.7 g/l, P less than 0.001, 'd greater than 1.006' ap...
Document 5 (Title: Spontaneous and amphetamine-induced behavior after bilateral injection of ethanolamine-O-sulfate into the substantia nigra.): Injections of ethanolamine-O-sulfate (EOS) (200 microgram/kg) through chronic indwelling cannulae into the zona reticulata of the substantia nigra in rats produced immediate contraversive turning (away from the injection side). Bilateral injections produced spontaneous stereotyped behaviors including sniffing and biting. Twenty-four hours after the first injection of EOS the rats showed a significantly decreased locomotor response to 1.5 mg/kg D-amphetamine. The spontaneous behaviors elicited following the initial injection of EOS increased both in nature and duration with the second and third injections of EOS, and persevered for 24 h. At this time 1.5 mg/kg D-amphetamine intensified this spontaneous stereotyped behavior. GABA levels were significantly higher in substantia nigra, hypothalamus, corpus striatum and cerebral cortex 24 h following single or repeated (3 x) injections of 200 microgram/kg of EOS into the zona reticulata of the SN. Dopamine levels in the corpus striatum were unchanged 24 h following...
