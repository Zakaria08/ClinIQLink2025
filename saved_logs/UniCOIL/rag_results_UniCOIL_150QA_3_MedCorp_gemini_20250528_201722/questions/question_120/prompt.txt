Document 1 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Unburned cured tobacco used orally contains nicotine, carcinogens, and other toxicants capable of causing gum disease, oral and pancreatic cancers, and an increase in the risk of heart disease. When tobacco is burned, the resultant smoke contains, in addition to nicotine, more than 7000 other compounds that result from volatilization, pyrolysis, and pyrosynthesis of tobacco and various chemical additives used in making different tobacco products. The smoke is composed of a fine aerosol and a vapor phase; aerosolized particles are of a size range that results in deposition in the airways and alveolar surfaces of the lungs.

Document 3 (Title: Binding of sodium dodecyl sulphate to an integral membrane protein and to a water-soluble enzyme. Determination by molecular-sieve chromatography with flow scintillation detection.): We have determined the binding of sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) to the human red cell glucose transporter (polypeptide, Mr 54,117) and to a water-soluble enzyme, N-5'-phosphoribosylanthranilate isomerase-indole-3-glycerol-phosphate synthase (PRAI-IGPS) from Escherichia coli (Mr 49,484). [35S]SDS was equilibrated with each protein on molecular-sieve chromatography at a series of SDS concentrations. The binding ratios of SDS to protein were determined by flow scintillation detection and automated amino acid analyses. Unexpectedly the glucose transporter, which is a transmembrane protein, bound about the same amount of SDS per gram of protein as did the enzyme. At 1.6 mM SDS, slightly below the critical micelle concentration (CMC) (1.8 mM) in the eluent, the binding ratio was 1.6 g SDS/g protein for both the glucose transporter and PRAI-IGPS. At 2.0 mM SDS (above the CMC) the glucose transporter showed a binding ratio of 1.7 g SDS/g protein. The corresponding value for the enzyme was about 1.5 g/g. The SDS-gluco...

Question: Select the correct statement(s) regarding complexes:
Options:
1. A complex can be positively charged
2. The stability of complexes can be a function of pH
3. Dilution increases the stability of complexes
