However, for the service to be covered and paid for by the managed care plan, the patient is still limited to only receiving care and service from network providers. HMOs' utilization and quality management programs collect much data on the care and services authorized and provided by the PCP and other providers. This data is communicated to the PCP and other network providers regularly as the financial incentives revolve around compliance with the managed care plan’s utilization and quality programs’ targets. For the patients, the financial incentive is that they receive insurance coverage only for services that occur within the network.",

The results of the program were published in The New England Journal of Medicine in November 2011. Comparing the 163,107 patients randomized to the intervention group with the 79,310 patients randomized to the control group, the researchers found that \"disease-management programs did not reduce hospital admissions or emergency room visits, as compared with usual care.\" Furthermore, there was \"no demonstrable savings in Medicare expenditures,\" with the net fees for disease management ranging from 3.8% to 10.9% per patient per month. The researchers suggested that the findings might be explained by the severity of chronic disease among the patients studied, delays in patients' receiving disease management after hospitalizations, and lack of integration between health coaches and the patients' primary care providers.",
