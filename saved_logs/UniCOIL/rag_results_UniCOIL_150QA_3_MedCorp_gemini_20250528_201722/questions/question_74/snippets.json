        "title": "Atypical facial pain, ectasia of the basilar artery, and baclofen: a case report.",
        "content": "Atypical facial pain is a clinical syndrome of facial pain that has been related to depression but whose pathogenesis is not known. We describe a 72-year-old woman with a chronic facial pain, and ectasia and left sided deviation of the basilar artery, that responded dramatically to baclofen. This case suggests that vascular compression of the trigeminal nerve may be one of the mechanisms producing this syndrome and in these cases it might respond to baclofen.",

        "content": "Although inflammation and pain are an essential part of healing (acute pain), in some circumstances, they can lead to negative effects. Several mechanisms involving the activation of peripheral and central sensitization pathways through the sensitization of peripheral nociceptors, and alterations in spinal dorsal horn neurons, and central nervous system (CNS) brain areas, can trigger a pathogenetic cascade that ends with the development of chronic pain. Again, pieces of evidence suggest the paramount role of the environment (i.e., epigenetic) and genetics. [2] [3] Thus, the chronicity of pain is the effect of changes in pain processing through transcription and transduction processes. As a consequence, chronic pain is no longer simply a symptom but becomes itself a disease. Currently, in the United States, estimates are that 100 million individuals suffer from the negative effects of protracted courses of pain and inflammation. [3] This epidemic is growing at an alarmingly fast rate and is taking a significant toll on the economy as well as patients and providers. In fact, there are reports that the cost for chronic pain patients is anywhere between 560 to 635 billion dollars annually. [3] Furthermore, increased opioid prescription and use, until opioid addiction in the United States and Canada is a dramatic phenomenon that has been responsible for up to 70.000 drug overdose deaths, in 2017. Although it appears that in other countries (e.g., Western Europe) the data is not so alarming.
