Document 1 (Title: Legg-Calve-Perthes Disease -- Prognosis -- Age at Onset): Usually younger age at diagnosis equals a better outcome. Patients less than 6 years old may develop a normal hip joint. Patients older than 6 years may have continued pain and subsequent arthritis. Lateral Pillar Classification (degree of femoral head involvement: A [least] to C [most]) Patients more than 8 years old and patients in lateral pillar group B or B/C (border group) do better with surgery than with nonoperative treatment. Patients less than 8 years old and patients in group B do well regardless of treatment choice. Patients in group C experience poor outcomes regarding hip condition, regardless of treatment choice.

Document 3 (Title: American Joint Committee on Cancer): Objectives The objectives of the AJCC are to: Facilitate a timely and rigorous, evidence-based process to support a biologically relevant system for classification and outcome prediction of cancer that is compatible with systems of cancer population surveillance. Proactively educate the oncology community through the development and delivery of effective programs and products to guide patient care. Promulgate research and serve as the clearinghouse to support the development of clinically relevant predictive tools, prognostic factors, and other indicators that classify and predict cancer. Foster collaborative relationships with AJCC member organizations and organizations with similar objectives in support of systems to diagnose and treat cancer. Support and be responsive to public and private efforts to improve care and predict outcomes for cancer patients.
