Document 1 (Title: Nuclear Medicine Applications in Prostate Cancer -- Technique or Treatment -- Summary: PET-Based Radionuclide Imaging in Prostate Cancer): Only 2 PET tracers are FDA-approved and recommended by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) for use in the initial staging of prostate cancer for patients with suspected metastatic disease AND biochemical recurrence or progression. [F-18] F-PSMA piflufolastat (DCFPyL) [Ga-68] Ga-PSMA-11 Five PET tracers are FDA-Approved and recommended by the NCCN for use only in prostate cancer patients with biochemical recurrence or progression.

Document 3 (Title: Fluorodeoxyglucose (18F)): Since its development in 1976, 18F-FDG had a profound influence on research in the neurosciences. The subsequent discovery in 1980 that 18F-FDG accumulates in tumors underpins the evolution of PET as a major clinical tool in cancer diagnosis. 18F-FDG is now the standard radiotracer used for PET neuroimaging and cancer patient management. The images can be assessed by a nuclear medicine physician or radiologist to provide diagnoses of various medical conditions.
