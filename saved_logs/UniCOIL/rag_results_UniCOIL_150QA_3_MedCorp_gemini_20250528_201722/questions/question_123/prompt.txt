Document 1 (Title: Glycogen Storage Disease Type I -- Treatment / Management): In patients with GSD I, cornstarch has been used for the treatment of hypoglycemia as its slow digestion provides a steady release of glucose. This maintains the glucose levels for longer periods of time. In young children, 1.6 gm of cornstarch per kg body weight every 3 to 4 hours is recommended. While older children, adolescents, and adults, are given 1.7 to 2.5 gm of cornstarch per kilogram body weight.
Document 2 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Serum uric acid >8 mg/dL Serum creatinine >1.6 mg/dL If, after 24–48 h Serum uric acid >8 mg/dL Serum creatinine >1.6 mg/dL Correct treatable renal failure (obstruction) Start rasburicase 0.2 mg/kg daily Serum uric acid ˜8.0 mg/dL Serum creatinine ˜1.6 mg/dL Urine pH °7.0 Delay chemotherapy if feasible or start hemodialysis Start chemotherapy ± chemotherapy Monitor serum chemistry every 6–12 h Discontinue bicarbonate administration* If serum potassium >6 meq/L Serum uric acid >10 mg/dL Serum creatinine >10 mg/dL Serum phosphate >10 mg/dL or increasing Symptomatic hypocalcemia present
Document 3 (Title: Influence of scheduling, dose, and volume of administration of a perfluorochemical emulsion on tumor response to radiation therapy.): Studies were carried out with a new, concentrated perfluorochemical emulsion (PFCE) of the perfluorochemical F44E (48% V/V). When given at 4, 1.6, or 1 g/kg in undiluted injection volumes iv 1 hr prior to a range of single doses of radiation with inspired carbogen dose modifying factors (DMF's) based on tumor growth delay (TGD) in the Lewis lung tumor of 2.5, 1.7, and 1.5, respectively, were produced. When the PFC dose was administered in a volume of 0.2 ml, the dose modifying factors produced by 4 g/kg (0.1 ml undiluted) did not change significantly (2.6), but the dose modifying factors produced by 1.6 g/kg (0.04 ml undiluted) and by 1.0 g/kg (0.025 ml undiluted) increased significantly to 2.0 and 1.8 (p less than 0.05), respectively. Using the tumor excision assay at 24 hr post treatment in the FSaIIC fibrosarcoma, administration of 6, 4, or 2 g/kg in 0.2 ml injections plus carbogen breathing 1 hr prior to and during treatment resulted in dose modifying factors of 1.5, 1.6, and 1.3, respectively.
