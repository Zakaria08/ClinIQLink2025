[30] Therefore, adding P-5′-P under measurement conditions that facilitate recombination with the enzymes usually increases aminotransferase activity. For clinical assays, following the principle that all factors affecting the reaction rate must be optimized and controlled, adding P-5′-P in aminotransferase methods is recommended to ensure that all enzymatic activity is measured.

        "content": "More frequent Pap smears may be needed to follow up after an abnormal Pap smear, after treatment for abnormal Pap or biopsy results, or after treatment of cancer ( cervical, colon, etc ). Effectiveness The Pap test, when combined with a regular program of screening and appropriate follow-up, can reduce cervical cancer deaths by up to 80%. Failure of prevention of cancer by the Pap test can occur for many reasons, including not getting regular screening, lack of appropriate follow-up of abnormal results, and sampling and interpretation errors. In the US, over half of all invasive cancers occur in females who have never had a Pap smear; an additional 10 to 20% of cancers occur in those who have not had a Pap smear in the preceding five years. About one-quarter of US cervical cancers were in people who had an abnormal Pap smear but did not get appropriate follow-up (patient did not return for care, or clinician did not perform recommended tests or treatment).",
