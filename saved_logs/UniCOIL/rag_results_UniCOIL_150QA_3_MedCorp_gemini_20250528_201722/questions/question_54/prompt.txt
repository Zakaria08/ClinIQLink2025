Document 1 (Title: Relationship of intraluminal pH and pressure within the lower esophageal sphincter.): To determine the relationship between lower esophageal sphincter (LES) intraluminal pressure and its intraluminal pH, we studied six healthy volunteers. We recorded intraluminal pressure and pH concurrently using rapid pull-through, slow pull-through, and station pull-through, as well as, rapid push-through and slow push-through techniques. The results showed that LES length was 35 +/- 4 (SE) mm by RPT and 30 +/- 3 mm by SPT. The pressure was maximal in the proximal half of the LES. On rapid pull-throughs, the intraluminal pH rose from about 1.5 to reach a value of about 2.5 at the peak of the high pressure zone. With continued withdrawal into the esophageal body, the recorded pH rose minimally to about 3-4. On push-throughs, the pH recorded along the LES was the same as that of the esophageal body. After the electrode cleared the LES, the pH abruptly fell to gastric pH. During station pull-through with the electrode 0.5-1.5 cm proximal to the distal LES margin, transient pH drops were observed with swallows....
Document 2 (Title: Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid): With no more material to make another raft, they hack through the jungle to beat Jack to the orchids and retrieve their raft. On the way they fall into a cave trying to escape from an anaconda. Cole gets lost and panics after finding a skeleton. He runs into Bill's partner, Tran, and as they return to the others, Tran gets pulled under and Cole tries to find him, however, Tran is eaten. Bill tries to find Cole and Tran, but also notices Tran's lost flashlight floating with his blood surrounding it. The terrified Cole escapes from the caves behind the group, seconds ahead of the snake, which follows him through the hole and gets stuck. Sam uses a machete to behead it, but another snake captures Cole. The team follows and find him being constricted, but still alive. Bill throws his knife and impales the snake through the head, killing it and freeing Cole.
Document 3 (Title: Percutaneous Gastrostomy and Jejunostomy -- Technique or Treatment): The "pull" technique is most commonly used and was initially introduced by Gauderer et al. A string is attached to a needle and inserted via the abdominal wall into the stomach. It is grasped with endoscopic biopsy forceps or a snare, and then the endoscope is retracted, taking out the string through the esophagus and mouth. Then the string is attached to the external end of the PEG tube, and the string is pulled back through the abdominal wall. This results in pulling the tube from the mouth to the esophagus, the stomach, and then outside the body through the abdominal wall. [9]

Question: Are the long-term results of the transanal pull-through equal to those of the transabdominal pull-through?
