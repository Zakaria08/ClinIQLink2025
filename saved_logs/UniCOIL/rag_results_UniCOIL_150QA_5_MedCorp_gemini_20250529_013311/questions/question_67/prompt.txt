Document 1 (Title: Relationship of self-concept to nutrient intake and eating patterns in young women.): The relationships between attitudes toward oneself (self-concept) and nutrition-related behavior were examined for 153 single women aged 18 to 35 years. Nutrition-related behaviors were assessed with 3-day food records that were analyzed for nutrient composition and eating patterns (Basic Four Food Group scores, number of meals per day, and percent of energy from meals and snacks). Attitudes toward self, knowledge and attitudes about nutrition, and general health practices were assessed with a written questionnaire that incorporated several existing scales. Because of potential overlap among the three self-concept scales, as well as nutrition-attitude and health-practice items, responses were factor analyzed, yielding 14 factors. These factors were then compared with nutrient intake and eating patterns. Scores for the seemingly desirable factors of the "Super Person" or "Do Your Own Thing" were negatively correlated with intake of several nutrients; scores on the self-perception of a "Traditional" orientation...
Document 2 (Title: Heterosexism): As a set of beliefs and attitudes Individual and group level Heterosexism as a set of beliefs and attitudes relies on a core tenet according to which homosexuality and bisexuality do not normally exist and, as such, constitute mental illnesses or deviant behaviors. Within a heterosexist ideology or mindset, the concept of sexual orientation is rejected or deemed irrelevant. A set of more nuanced heterosexist views, which some may consider faith, dogma, universal truths, natural law, appeals to authority, or popular beliefs, but others consider to be conventional wisdom or sociobiological knowledge can include, among others, the following:
Document 3 (Title: Ventilator Safety -- Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes): Data reveals that most medical schools and residency programs do not prepare junior doctors with adequate training in managing patients on mechanical ventilation. A great deal of variability exists among medical residents in providing care for ventilated patients. Registered nurses have very limited knowledge of mechanical ventilation and receive very little formal nursing education on this topic.
Document 4 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): these materials for improving knowledge, attitudes, skills, and outcomes.8 Social media has become a necessary component of surgical practice.questions, text resources and videos, and self-assessment quizzes. Although improvements in quality examination per-formance among residencies that subscribe to SCORE are prom-ising, no studies have definitely demonstrated that SCORE use improves resident knowledge, skills, or clinical performance.Web-based education can also be used for assessing and teaching surgical skills. In 2013, Birkmeyer et al performed a study that correlated surgical skills in bariatric surgery, based on blinded reviews of videotaped operations, to clini-cal outcomes. The ability to discriminate surgeons with good and poor technical skills using video-based assessments has signifi-cant implications for training surgeons and for evaluating their performance. With regards to training, multiple web-based and virtual reality simulators have been developed that allow
Document 5 (Title: Techniques and Strategies in Ultrasound Simulation  -- Curriculum Development): In this regard, an approach to curriculum development of simulation-based POCUS should include establishing comprehensive learning objectives. One such objective commonly used in medical and healthcare education is Bloom's taxonomy of learning, which emphasizes 3 main categories: knowledge, skills, and attitudes. Knowledge commonly reflects the assimilation of learned information. The skills category denotes the development of psychomotor and coordinated aspects of machine and examiner interaction. Attitudes represent the combination of knowledge and skills related to learners integrating concepts into clinical decision-making and professional behavior. [6]
