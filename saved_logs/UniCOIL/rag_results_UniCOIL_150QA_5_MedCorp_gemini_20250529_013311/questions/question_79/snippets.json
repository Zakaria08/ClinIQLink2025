        "title": "Hypoxia-induced alterations of norepinephrine vascular reactivity in isolated perfused cat lung.",
        "content": "Past work in the isolated perfused cat lung has shown that acute hypoxia (H) changes the response to norepinephrine (NE) from vasoconstriction to vasodilation but has no effect on the response to serotonin (S). These results could be related to the increase in pulmonary arterial pressure or vascular resistance during the hypoxic pressor response or a direct effect of H. We addressed this question, in the same preparation, by comparing responses to NE under four conditions in each experimental animal (n = 12): 1) NE infused during normoxia; 2) NE infused after vascular resistance (Rpv) was increased with serotonin; 3) NE infused after Rpv was increased by H; 4) NE infused after lobar pressure was raised by an increase in flow (P/F). PO2 values during H were varied (27-56 Torr). S and H produced a 137 +/- 35 and 43 +/- 8% delta Rpv increase in lobar vascular resistance, respectively. P/F increased lobar pressure 91 +/- 10%. Only NE infusion during H demonstrated significant differences in lobar pressure and Rpv compared with control normoxic periods. There was no correlation between responses to NE during S, H, and P/F and degree to which each stimulus increased Rpv or lobar pressure (r = 0.003, 0.28, 0.24). A significant relationship between response to NE during H vs. PO2 during H was observed (r = 0.78; P less than 0.001). In a subset of animals, we repeated the infusion of NE during H and P/F post-beta-blockade. The decrease in vascular response to NE during H and the correlation of PO2 with NE response were abolished (n = 7).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Acute indications for therapy include hypoxemia (low blood oxygen levels), carbon monoxide toxicity and cluster headache. It may also be prophylactically given to maintain blood oxygen levels during the induction of anesthesia. Oxygen therapy is often useful in chronic hypoxemia caused by conditions such as severe COPD or cystic fibrosis. Oxygen can be delivered via nasal cannula or face mask, or via high pressure conditions such as in endotracheal intubation or hyperbaric chamber. It can also be given through bypassing the airway, such as in ECMO therapy.",
