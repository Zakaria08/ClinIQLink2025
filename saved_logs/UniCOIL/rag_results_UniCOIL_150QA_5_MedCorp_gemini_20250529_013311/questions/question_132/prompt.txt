Document 1 (Title: Bovine viral diarrhea): PI animals recognise intra-cellular BVD viral particles as ‘self’ and shed virus in large quantities throughout life; they represent the cornerstone of the success of BVD as a disease. Currently, it was shown in a worldwide review study that the PI prevalence at animal level ranged from low (≤0.8% Europe, North America, Australia), medium (>0.8% to 1.6% East Asia) to high (>1.6% West Asia). Countries that had failed to implement any BVDV control and/or eradication programmes (including vaccination) had the highest PI prevalence. Virus classification and structure BVDVs are members of the genus Pestivirus, belonging to the family Flaviviridae. Other members of this genus cause Border disease (sheep) and classical swine fever (pigs) which cause significant financial loss to the livestock industry. Pestiviruses are small, spherical, single-stranded, enveloped RNA viruses of 40 to 60 nm in diameter.
Document 2 (Title: Immunology_Janeway): HIV infection does not immediately cause AIDS. Without treatment, the average time to development of AIDS following infection of adults is several years. The long delay between infection and development of symptomatic immune deficiency reflects the unusual tropism of the virus for CD4 T cells of the immune system, as well as the nature of the immune response to the virus. HIV is now pandemic, and despite great strides in treatment and prevention that have followed from a greater understanding of the pathogenesis and epidemiology of the disease, 1.6 million people died of AIDSrelated causes in 2012 and an estimated 35.3 million are infected by HIV worldwide, presaging the death of many from AIDS for years to come (Fig. 13.28). In subSaharan Africa, which accounts for over twothirds of the global incidence, 1 in every 20 adults is infected. Indeed, HIV/AIDS has emerged as the most deadly single infectious agent in the short time since its identification as a new human pathogen.
Document 3 (Title: 38-Year-Old Male Presents With Lower Extremity Edema -- Case Presentation): His physical exam revealed clear lungs and a normal heart exam on auscultation. His abdomen was soft and non-tender, and his skin was warm and dry with no rash. He had 2 plus pitting edema at the ankles. Initial laboratory data was consistent with acute kidney injury (AKI) with worsening creatinine from 1.2 to 1.6 over 1 month and nephrotic range proteinuria. Serologies for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, anti-nuclear antibody (ANA), c-ANCA, serine protease 3 (PR3) IgG, myeloperoxidase antibody (MPO), and complement levels were sent. He was started on losartan for proteinuria with plans for renal biopsy; however, he was lost to follow up. The patient then presented two weeks later with worsening edema to his waist, continued weight gain, mild hemoptysis, and streaks of blood in the stool. Physical examination now showed worsening pitting edema up to his waist with new non-pruritic, erythematous excoriations on the medial aspect of his thighs bilaterally. He was admitted to the hospital with concern for worsening va...
Document 4 (Title: Prevalence of hepatitis B and C viruses and human immunodeficiency virus infections in women of reproductive age.): To determine the prevalence of hepatitis B and C viruses, and human immunodeficiency virus infections in women of reproductive age attending a health care system. Prospective cross-sectional study. Public Obstetric Clinic and Service for Pre- and Perinatal Prevention of Infectious Diseases, Rome, Latium Region, Italy. 1142 women attending our centres consecutively for delivery, miscarriage, voluntary interruption of pregnancy or screening for pre- and perinatal prevention of infectious diseases. Serum samples, collected after informed consent over a period of 2 months, were tested for hepatitis B virus markers (anti-HBc and HBsAg) by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), for antibodies against hepatitis C virus (by ELISA and, if positive, by RIBA) and for human immunodeficiency virus antibodies (by ELISA and, if positive by Western blot). The seroprevalence of hepatitis B virus was 14.4% (95% CI Poisson distribution 12.2-16.5) for anti-HBc and 1.6% (95% CI, 0.9-2.5) for HBsAg. Antibodies against hepatiti...
