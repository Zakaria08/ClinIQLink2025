[30] Therefore, adding P-5′-P under measurement conditions that facilitate recombination with the enzymes usually increases aminotransferase activity. For clinical assays, following the principle that all factors affecting the reaction rate must be optimized and controlled, adding P-5′-P in aminotransferase methods is recommended to ensure that all enzymatic activity is measured.

        "content": "More frequent Pap smears may be needed to follow up after an abnormal Pap smear, after treatment for abnormal Pap or biopsy results, or after treatment of cancer ( cervical, colon, etc ). Effectiveness The Pap test, when combined with a regular program of screening and appropriate follow-up, can reduce cervical cancer deaths by up to 80%. Failure of prevention of cancer by the Pap test can occur for many reasons, including not getting regular screening, lack of appropriate follow-up of abnormal results, and sampling and interpretation errors. In the US, over half of all invasive cancers occur in females who have never had a Pap smear; an additional 10 to 20% of cancers occur in those who have not had a Pap smear in the preceding five years. About one-quarter of US cervical cancers were in people who had an abnormal Pap smear but did not get appropriate follow-up (patient did not return for care, or clinician did not perform recommended tests or treatment).",

        "content": "The prognostic significance of clonal karyotype status in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is assessed after an extended follow-up period of 5 years. There are three karyotype, single abnormalities or multiple abnormalities at the time of referral. However, there is no correlation between the size of the abnormal clone and prognosis. Karyotype status has independent prognostic significance in 'high risk' MDS so that patients with a refractory anaemia with excess of blasts (RAEB)/RAEB in transformation (RAEB-t) and a normal karyotype survive significantly longer than those with an abnormal karyotype (P &lt; 0.001) and do not differ significantly from patients with refractory anaemia (RA). Significant differences in survival according to karyotype status are also seen in patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (P &lt; 0.001) but not in those with primary acquired sideroblastic anaemia and RA. Among patients studied sequentially, those who retained a normal karyotype survived significantly longer than those who developed an abnormality on follow-up (P &lt; 0.001). The risk of leukaemic transformation was also increased in patients who presented with or subsequently developed a clonal karyotype abnormality compared with those who remained normal (P &lt; 0.05).",

        "content": "Staphylococcal skin colonization is a common feature of atopic dermatitis (AD) in adults. Little is known about prevalence and persistence of staphylococci in children. Forty-one AD children (mean age, 70 months) and 41 age-matched controls were studied. S. aureus was isolated from 38 AD patients (93%; 32% of controls, P less than .001) and 37% of AD patients (5% of controls, P less than .001) harbored toxigenic (enterotoxins, toxic shock syndrome toxin) S. aureus strains. No individual biotype prevailed. On follow-up (mean interval, 9 months), 70% of S. aureus strains were reisolated. Nasal and cutaneous S. aureus strains were identical in 73% of AD patients (7% of controls, P less than .001), reflecting increased self-contamination. Identical staphylococcal strains in AD children and their mothers were observed in 38% (S. aureus) and 16% (coagulase-negative strains; P less than .001). The prevalence of staphylococcal colonization in AD children is comparable to that in adults. High rates of self-contamination, transmission to contacts, and prevalence of toxigenic strains in AD children may have clinical and epidemiologic implications.",
