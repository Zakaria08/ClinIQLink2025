Document 1 (Title: Anticoagulant Therapy In Pregnancy -- Summary / Explanation): Monitoring and laboratory tests : Regular monitoring with laboratory testing is sometimes needed to ensure efficacy and safety. Patients on UFH should be monitored to maintain an aPTT in the therapeutic range of 1.5 to 2.5 times the control 6 hours after the injection. Anticoagulation with LMWH can be monitored by following anti-factor Xa levels. However, the need to monitor these patients remains uncertain. For those on weight-based therapeutic doses, studies in which anti-factor Xa levels have been monitored with a goal of 0.6 to 1.0 units/mL, show that few patients will require dosing adjustments beyond those they would already receive as their weight naturally increases during pregnancy. The decision to monitor patients on therapeutic LMWH should, therefore, be based on institutional protocols and clinical judgment. Additionally, optimal anti-factor Xa levels have not been determined for patients receiving prophylactic LMWH, so patients on prophylactic doses rarely require regular monitoring. Finally, clo...
Document 2 (Title: Direct therapeutic exposure): Direct therapeutic exposure (DTE) is a behavior therapy technique pioneered by Patrick A. Boudewyns, where stressors are vividly and safely confronted to help combat veterans, and patients suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), panic disorder, or phobias. Exposure therapy has supporting evidence with both simple and complex traumas. A similar therapy is Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR). First known publication in book form is Flooding and Implosive Therapy: Direct Therapeutic Exposure in Clinical Practice by Patrick A. Boudewyns, Robert H. Shipley. 1983. . It is not uncommon to combine DTE treatment with other therapies. Use Direct exposure has been used with a variety of populations including agoraphobia and chronic PTSD It involves as the name applies placing the client either real or imaginally in the feared situation.
Document 3 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): Monitoring of Heparin Effect Close monitoring of the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT or PTT) is necessary in patients receiving UFH. Levels of UFH may also be determined by protamine titration (therapeutic levels 0.2–0.4 unit/mL) or anti-Xa units (therapeutic levels 0.3–0.7 unit/mL). Weight-based dosing of the LMW heparins results in predictable pharmacokinetics and plasma levels in patients with normal renal function. Therefore, LMW heparin levels are not generally measured except in the setting of renal insufficiency, obesity, and pregnancy. LMW heparin levels can be determined by anti-Xa units. For enoxaparin, peak therapeutic levels should be 0.5–1 unit/mL for twice-daily dosing, determined 4 hours after administration, and approximately 1.5 units/mL for once-daily dosing.
Document 4 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): Continuous intravenous administration of heparin is accomplished via an infusion pump. After an initial bolus injection of 80–100 units/kg, a continuous infusion of about 15–22 units/kg per hour is required to maintain the anti-Xa activity in the range of 0.3–0.7 units/mL. Low-dose prophylaxis is achieved with subcutaneous administration of heparin, 5000 units every 8–12 hours. Because of the danger of hematoma formation at the injection site, heparin must never be administered intramuscularly. Prophylactic enoxaparin is given subcutaneously in a dosage of 30 mg twice daily or 40 mg once daily. Full-dose enoxaparin therapy is 1 mg/kg subcutaneously every 12 hours. This corresponds to a therapeutic anti-factor Xa level of 0.5–1 unit/mL. Selected patients may be treated with enoxaparin 1.5 mg/kg once a day, with a target anti-Xa level of 1.5 units/mL.
Document 5 (Title: Treatment of acute soft tissue trauma with a topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (biphenylacetic acid 3% gel).): Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been shown to be effective in the treatment of acute soft tissue injuries. However, taken orally, NSAIDs have a definite incidence of gastro-intestinal toxicity. Since acute soft tissue trauma is normally localised, use of a topical NSAID may eliminate this undesirable side-effect. This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a topical NSAID, biphenylacetic acid 3% gel (Traxam) in the treatment of soft tissue trauma. Thirty-two patients (22 males and 10 females) with acute soft tissue trauma were enrolled at the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, National University Hospital, Singapore from 7 June 1988 to 28 March 1989. Each patient was treated for a period of one week with bipenylacetic acid 3% gel (Traxam), 60 mg three times a day. Statistically significant improvement was found in pain, swelling and functional impairment in all patients assessed at day 3 and day 7 after the injury. The speed of recovery was enhanced. The medication was f...
