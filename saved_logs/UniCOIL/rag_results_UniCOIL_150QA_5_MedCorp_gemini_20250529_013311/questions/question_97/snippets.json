Summarize the most important evaluations needed to diagnose a middle cerebral artery stroke. Outline the differential diagnoses that must be considered if a patient presents with stroke-like symptoms but does not have a stroke. Review how to address the modifiable risk factors for secondary stroke prevention after a stroke, and how the interprofessional team can be involved in improving the outcome and quality of life of a stroke patient. Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.",

Therapeutic strategies that have potential to improve clinical outcomes in reperfused STEMI patients include remote ischemic conditioning (RIC), exenatide, and metoprolol. These have emerged amongst a multitude of cardioprotective interventions investigated with largely neutral clinical data. Of these, RIC has the most robust clinical evidence, especially in the context of STEMI, but also emerging for other indications such as acute ischemic stroke and aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.",

        "title": "rCBF-SPECT in brain infarction: when does it predict outcome?",
        "content": "We prospectively studied 26 patients with ischemic stroke within 24 hr, after 2 wk, and after 6 mo with thallium-201-diethyldithiocarbamate single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and neurologic and functional assessments. The admission flow deficits correlated with outcome. The admission and 6-mo scores correlated with clinical conditions at each time. At 2 wk, the flow deficits were smaller and did not correlate with clinical parameters. Nor did the presence or absence of hyperfixation of the radiopharmaceutical. Six months after the infarct, the flow defect had decreased in 9 of 15 patients in whom three serial scans were available, with better clinical improvement than in the remaining six whose flow deficits increased. More patients in the first group had been treated randomly with the calcium-entry blocker flunarizine. SPECT imaging of rCBF within 24 hr after stroke correlates with clinical outcome and condition, whereas rCBF imaging at 2 wk after the stroke shows no clinical correlation.",
