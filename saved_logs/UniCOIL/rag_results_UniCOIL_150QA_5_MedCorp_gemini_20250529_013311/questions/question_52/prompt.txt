Document 1 (Title: Response of the ke test to NCI/NTP-screened chemicals. I. Non-genotoxic carcinogens and genotoxic non-carcinogens.): The response of a physico-chemical carcinogen-screening test, the k(e) test, to 46 rodent carcinogens and 20 putative non-carcinogens that had been screened in long-term two-species bioassays by the National Cancer Institute/National Toxicology Program are reported. All of the chemicals screened are those that yield mutagenicity responses in the Ames Salmonella/microsome test that are either equivocal or contrary to the rodent carcinogenicity responses. The electron attachment rate constants, k(e)S, of the test chemicals in cyclohexane at 21 degrees C were measured using a pulse-conductivity technique. The k(e)S of 27 of the 46 rodent carcinogens (59%) are equal or greater than the diffusion-controlled k(e) of carbon tetrachloride, which is regarded as the boundary between a positive and negative response; the k(e)S of 8 of the 20 mutagenic non-carcinogens (40%) are less than diffusion-controlled. If the boundary between positive and negative k(e) responses is decreased to half the diffusion-controlled k(e), ...
Document 2 (Title: Vitamin E Toxicity -- Pathophysiology): The current literature describes several different mechanisms of vitamin E's action on coagulation and platelet function. Vitamin K precursors need enzymes to convert into their active forms. It is thought that vitamin E may challenge these precursors for these enzymes. As a result, the circulation of vitamin-K-induced coagulation factors is decreased. [3] Vitamin K-dependent proteins such as factors II, VII, IX, and X, along with proteins C and S, are involved in the clotting cascade. [13] If vitamin K concentrations are reduced, these factors are also decreased, promoting bleeding.
