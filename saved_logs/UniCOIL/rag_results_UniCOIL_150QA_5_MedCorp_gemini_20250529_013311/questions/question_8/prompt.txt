Document 2 (Title: Influence of scheduling, dose, and volume of administration of a perfluorochemical emulsion on tumor response to radiation therapy.): Studies were carried out with a new, concentrated perfluorochemical emulsion (PFCE) of the perfluorochemical F44E (48% V/V). When given at 4, 1.6, or 1 g/kg in undiluted injection volumes iv 1 hr prior to a range of single doses of radiation with inspired carbogen dose modifying factors (DMF's) based on tumor growth delay (TGD) in the Lewis lung tumor of 2.5, 1.7, and 1.5, respectively, were produced. When the PFC dose was administered in a volume of 0.2 ml, the dose modifying factors produced by 4 g/kg (0.1 ml undiluted) did not change significantly (2.6), but the dose modifying factors produced by 1.6 g/kg (0.04 ml undiluted) and by 1.0 g/kg (0.025 ml undiluted) increased significantly to 2.0 and 1.8 (p less than 0.05), respectively. Using the tumor excision assay at 24 hr post treatment in the FSaIIC fibrosarcoma, administration of 6, 4, or 2 g/kg in 0.2 ml injections plus carbogen breathing 1 hr prior to and during treatment resulted in dose modifying factors of 1.5, 1.6, and 1.3, respectively.

Document 4 (Title: Hepatitis B -- Treatment / Management -- Management): Acute hepatitis B infection is self cleared in 95% of healthy adults. Management is supportive in a majority of patients. Patients with severe acute disease (2 of the 3: bilirubin more than 10 mg/dl, INR more than 1.6 and hepatic encephalopathy) and protracted acute severe disease (total bilirubin more than 3 mg/dl or direct bilirubin more than 1.5 mg/dl, INR more than 1.5, hepatic encephalopathy, or ascites) need antiviral treatment.
Document 5 (Title: Maternal cigarette smoking during pregnancy in relation to oral clefts.): Studies on maternal smoking in relation to oral cleft defects have yielded inconsistent findings, with results ranging from no association to sixfold increases in risk. The authors examined this relation in a case-control study conducted in Boston, Massachusetts, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Toronto, Ontario, Canada, and the state of Iowa during the years 1983-1987, in which mothers of malformed infants were interviewed within 6 months after delivery about prenatal events and exposures. Maternal cigarette smoking during pregnancy for 400 infants with cleft lip with or without cleft palate and for 215 infants with cleft palate alone was compared with that for 2,710 infants with other malformations (controls). Relative risks (and 95% confidence intervals) were estimated for smokers of 1-14, 15-24, and greater than or equal to 25 cigarettes per day relative to never smokers; the respective estimates for cleft lip with or without cleft palate were 1.2 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.9-1.6), 1.4 (95% CI 1.0-2.1), a...

Question: A 3900-g (8.6-lb) male infant is delivered at 39 weeks' gestation via spontaneous vaginal delivery.

Options:
A. Gastric fundus in the thorax
B. Pancreatic ring around the duodenum
C. Hypertrophy of the gastric pylorus
D. Large bowel in the inguinal canal
