        "content": "Studies were carried out with a new, concentrated perfluorochemical emulsion (PFCE) of the perfluorochemical F44E (48% V/V). When given at 4, 1.6, or 1 g/kg in undiluted injection volumes iv 1 hr prior to a range of single doses of radiation with inspired carbogen dose modifying factors (DMF's) based on tumor growth delay (TGD) in the Lewis lung tumor of 2.5, 1.7, and 1.5, respectively, were produced. When the PFC dose was administered in a volume of 0.2 ml, the dose modifying factors produced by 4 g/kg (0.1 ml undiluted) did not change significantly (2.6), but the dose modifying factors produced by 1.6 g/kg (0.04 ml undiluted) and by 1.0 g/kg (0.025 ml undiluted) increased significantly to 2.0 and 1.8 (p less than 0.05), respectively. Using the tumor excision assay at 24 hr post treatment in the FSaIIC fibrosarcoma, administration of 6, 4, or 2 g/kg in 0.2 ml injections plus carbogen breathing 1 hr prior to and during treatment resulted in dose modifying factors of 1.5, 1.6, and 1.3, respectively. In a fractionated radiation protocol in the Lewis lung tumor using four daily fractions, a dose of 4 g/kg of PFC on days 1 and 3 proved superior to a dose of 2 g/kg daily (dose modifying factors 2.4 vs. 1.9, p less than 0.05). When a fractionated radiation regimen of 3 Gy daily X 5 and carbogen was used, PFC doses of 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 g/kg administered undiluted produced increasing tumor growth delays with increasing dose of PFCE and increasing frequency of administration. In addition, dilutions to 0.2 ml proved significantly more effective. In a 2-week fractionated radiation protocol using 2, 3, or 4 Gy daily X 5 weekly, PFCE given in 0.2 ml volume plus carbogen breathing daily at 4, 1.6, or 1 g/kg produced dose modifying factors of 2.0, 1.9, and 1.6, respectively. Finally, when used in a day 1, 3, and 5 radiation regimen for 3 weeks at 2, 3, or 4 Gy/fraction, 4 g/kg of PFCE given in a volume of 0.2 ml plus carbogen breathing produced a superior dose modifying factor (1.6) as compared with 1.6 or 1.0 g/kg (dose modifying factors 1.4 and 1.3, respectively). These results indicate that PFCE plus carbogen breathing effectively enhances the antitumor effects of both single dose and fractionated radiation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

        "content": "Studies on maternal smoking in relation to oral cleft defects have yielded inconsistent findings, with results ranging from no association to sixfold increases in risk. The authors examined this relation in a case-control study conducted in Boston, Massachusetts, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Toronto, Ontario, Canada, and the state of Iowa during the years 1983-1987, in which mothers of malformed infants were interviewed within 6 months after delivery about prenatal events and exposures. Maternal cigarette smoking during pregnancy for 400 infants with cleft lip with or without cleft palate and for 215 infants with cleft palate alone was compared with that for 2,710 infants with other malformations (controls). Relative risks (and 95% confidence intervals) were estimated for smokers of 1-14, 15-24, and greater than or equal to 25 cigarettes per day relative to never smokers; the respective estimates for cleft lip with or without cleft palate were 1.2 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.9-1.6), 1.4 (95% CI 1.0-2.1), and 0.7 (95% CI 0.3-1.6), and for cleft palate alone, estimates were 1.0 (95% CI 0.7-1.5), 0.9 (95% CI 0.5-1.5), and 0.8 (95% CI 0.3-2.2). Relative risks were also close to unity for case subgroups divided according to the presence or absence of an associated malformation. Multivariate control of several potential confounders did not alter these estimates. Based on this large series of cases, maternal smoking during pregnancy does not appear to increase the risk of oral clefts.",
