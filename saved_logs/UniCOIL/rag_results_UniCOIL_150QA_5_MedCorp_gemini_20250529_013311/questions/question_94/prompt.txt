Document 1 (Title: Expanded criteria donor): Expanded Criteria Donor (ECD) is normally associated with kidney donors. They are also referred to as donors with "medical complexities". ECD donors are normally aged 60 years or older, or over 50 years with at least two of the following conditions: hypertension history, serum creatinine > 1.5 mg/dl or cause of death from cerebrovascular accident. Of the 9319 living kidney donations reported in the American Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) / United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) database from July 2004 to December 2005, 368 (4.0%) donors were over the age of 60 (of which 86 [0.9%] were over the age of 65), 956 (10.3%) had hypertension, 2785 (29.9%) had an eGFR < 80 mL/min per 1.73 m2 (of which 392 [4.2%] had an eGFR < 60 mL/min per 1.73 m2) and 1194 (12.8%) had a BMI > 30 kg/m2 (of which 250 [2.7%] had a BMI > 35 kg/m2) The concept of ECD was raised to address the discrepancy between demand and supply in kidney transplantation.

Document 2 (Title: The effect of donor age on graft survival in pediatric cadaver renal transplant recipients--a report of the North American Pediatric Renal Transplant Cooperative Study.): Data from the North American Pediatric Renal Transplant Cooperative Study were analyzed to determine the effect of donor age on graft survival for pediatric recipients of cadaver donor renal transplants. Between January 1, 1987, and November 16, 1990, 787 cadaver donor renal transplants in children less than 18 years of age were registered in the study. The ages of the donors were less than or equal to 5 years in 203 transplants, between 6 and 9 years in 87, between 10 and 39 in 389, and greater than or equal to 40 years in 108. The risk of graft loss was related to donor age by a proportional hazards analysis. The ideal donor age was 20-25 years. The risk of graft loss was increased by both young and old donor age. The risk of graft loss from a neonate donor was 2.7-fold that of the ideal donor, and the risk from a 50-year-old donor was 1.8-fold that of the ideal donor. The relationship between donor age and graft survival was not affected by the age of the recipient. Cold storage time had an added impact on...
Document 3 (Title: Hair Transplantation -- Preparation): Calculate the desired recipient graft number or total number of grafts needed by multiplying the measured recipient area by the desired graft density. The target density should be around 30 FUs per cm². If planning FUT for graft harvest, calculate the strip length by dividing the desired recipient graft number by the donor site density using a densitometer. The strip should be approximately 1 to 1.5 cm wide but no larger to allow tension-free wound closure. [14]
Document 4 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Transplantation in the Treatment of Renal Failure Deceased donor >60 years Deceased donor >50 years and hypertension and creatinine >1.5 mg/dL Deceased donor >50 years and hypertension and death caused by cerebro vascular accident (CVA) Deceased donor >50 years and death caused by CVA and creatinine >1.5 mg/dL I: Brought in dead II: Unsuccessful resuscitation III: Awaiting cardiac arrest IV: Cardiac arrest after brainstem death V: Cardiac arrest in a hospital patient aKidneys can be used for transplantation from categories II–V but are commonly only used from categories III and IV. The survival of these kidneys has not been shown to be inferior to that of deceased-donor kidneys. Note: Kidneys can be both ECD and DCD. ECD kidneys have been shown to have a poorer survival, and there is a separate shorter waiting list for ECD kidneys. They are generally used for patients for whom the benefits of being transplanted earlier outweigh the associated risks of using an ECD kidney.
Document 5 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): tested with methylene blue (blue hue look of the kidneys). B. En bloc kidneys transplanted into a 62-year-old woman. Donor aorta anastomosed to recipient’s exter-nal iliac artery; donor cava, to recipient’s external iliac vein.Grafts With Multiple Renal ArteriesIn 10% to 30% of donor kidneys, multiple renal arteries are encountered. Unless kidney transplant candidates have hyper-coagulopathy, grafts with multiple renal arteries fare as well as those with single vessels.86 Vascular reconstruction options include implanting the donor’s arteries separately, reconstruct-ing the multiple arteries into a common channel, or combining multiple arteries into a common Carrel patch (Fig. 11-8).En Bloc GraftsDebate persists about whether to implant kidneys obtained from young donors (<5 years or whose body weight is under 20 kg) as a single en bloc unit into one recipient or separately into two recipients. The underlying issues are the shortage of donor organs, the complexity of the surgical
