Document 1 (Title: Responsible Controlled Substance and Opioid Prescribing -- Evaluation -- Commonly Ordered Drug Tests with Windows of Detection On Urinary Testing): This list summarizes some commonly ordered drug tests and their windows of detection. [45] Amphetamines: 2 to 3 days Benzodiazepines short acting: 3 to 5 days Benzodiazepines long acting: Up to 30 days Buprenorphine: Up to 11 days Cannabis daily use: 2 to 4 weeks Cannabis heavy use: Up to 12 weeks Cocaine: 1 to 5 hours (for metabolites, 2 to 4 days) Codeine: 1 to 2 days Fentanyl: 2 to 3 days Heroin and morphine: 3 days Hydromorphone: 1 to 2 days Methadone: 3 to 4 days and up to 14 days Oxycodone immediate release: 1 to 1.5 days Oxycodone controlled release: 1.5 to 3 days Oxymorphone immediate release: 1.5 to 2.5 days Oxymorphone controlled release: 1 to 4 days Phencyclidine: 1.5 to 10 days Tapentadol: 1 to 5 days Tramadol: 2 to 4 days Zolpidem: 1 to 5 days
Document 2 (Title: Molecular characterization of the human platelet integrin GPIIb/IIIa and its constituent glycoproteins.): Human platelet plasma membrane glycoproteins IIb (GPIIb) and IIIa (GPIIIa) form a Ca(2+)-dependent heterodimer, the integrin GPIIb/IIIa, which serves as the receptor for fibrinogen and other adhesive proteins at the surface of activated platelets. Below the critical micellar concentration of Triton X100 (TtX), the three glycoproteins do not bind appreciably to TtX and form association products of large size. The size-exclusion chromatographic patterns of GPIIb, GPIIIa and GPIIb/IIIa have been obtained at 0.2% TtX, and the molecular properties of the association products and monomer fractions have been determined by analysis of the detergent bound to the glycoproteins, laser-light scattering, sedimentation velocity, and electron microscopy (TEM). The monomer of the GPIIb-TtX complex was identified by the molecular mass (M) of the glycoprotein moiety (125 +/- 15 kDa), the molecular size (9.5 +/- 1.5 nm x 11 +/- 1.5 nm) and globular shape observed by TEM. It has a molecular mass (M*) of 197 +/- 20 kDa, a sedimen...

Document 4 (Title: Perodua Myvi): Facelift The facelifted third generation Myvi was launched on 18 November 2021. The Perodua Smart Drive Assist (PSDA), also known as ASA 3.0, replaces the ASA 2.0 in the outgoing pre-facelift Myvi and it is standard on all variants except for the base 1.3 G. There are 5 variants on offer. The 1.3-litre engine option now consists of only 2 variants, the base 1.3 G, and 1.3 G with PSDA, while the 1.5-litre engine option now consists of the 1.5 X, 1.5 H and 1.5 AV variants. The 4-speed automatic that has been in use since the first generation Myvi has been replaced by a D-CVT that is also found in the Perodua Ativa. The D-CVT is the only transmission option. The 5-speed manual transmission that was previously offered only on 1.3-litre variants was dropped due to low sales of only 1 percent. 1.5 AV variant gets new features including adaptive cruise control, blind spot monitoring, rear cross traffic alert and lane departure warning with lane departure prevention.
Document 5 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): The Active Cell Membrane In atrial and ventricular cells, the diastolic membrane potential (phase 4) is typically very stable. This is because it is dominated by a potassium permeability or conductance that is due to the activity of channels that generate an inward-rectifying potassium current (IK1). This keeps the membrane potential near the potassium SCN5A/Nav 1.5 Ca2+ L-type CACNA1/Cav 1.2 current T-type CACNA1G,H/Cav 3.1, 3.2 transient lto,f KCND3/Kv 4.3 outward lto,s KCNA4/Kv 1.4 lKur KCNA5/Kv 1.5 lK,ACh KCNJ3, 5/Kir 3.1, 3.4 lCl CFTR/CFTR inward rectifier, lK1 KCNJ2/Kir 2.1 pacemaker current, lf HCN2, 4/HCN2, 4 Na+/Ca2+ exchange SLC8A1/NCX 1 Na+/K+-ATPase NKAIN1-4/Na, K-pump
