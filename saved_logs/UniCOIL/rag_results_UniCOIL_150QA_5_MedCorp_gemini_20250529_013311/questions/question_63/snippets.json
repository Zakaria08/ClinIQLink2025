        "content": "The only way to prevent suicides is to work in an interprofessional team that includes a mental health nurse, psychiatrist, primary care provider, social worker, and nurse practitioner. Practitioners must work with the patient's family and friends, as well as with the other patients who knew the deceased. The first step is to prevent harm to the patient and, secondly, treat the cause of the behavior that is causing suicidal ideations. All patients with suicidal ideations should be closely monitored. The family should be educated about the potential signs of danger. Unfortunately, in many cases, the healthcare system does fail, as many patients go on to end their lives. [21] [Level 5]",

        "content": "History The concierge medicine model, although not the term, originated with MD² International, which was founded in 1996 in Seattle by Dr. Howard Maron and Dr. Scott Hall. At the time, Maron was physician for the Seattle SuperSonics sports team, and sought to provide luxury primary care services similar to what he had been providing these athletes. MD²'s model included physician patient loads of 50 families, dramatically reduced compared with the conventional American patient load of about 3,000 patients per year. Advantages include very quick access to your personal physician as needed, and the ability to see doctors in any of 10 major cities at a greatly increased cost. MD² clients have insurance to cover additional services beyond primary care, but MD²'s fees cover the full costs of their services and MD² does not bill insurance.",

It has only recently been recognized that the family caregiver is at risk for increased physical and mental morbidity because of this often stressful task. If the situation is too stressful, elder abuse may result. Family physicians are in a good position to identify caregiver stress, recognize the danger signs of elder abuse, provide support, education and advice, and intervene when necessary. Primary care providers should routinely ask about caregiving responsibilities when obtaining the medical history of any patient over age 45.",

        "content": "We used a two-group hybrid, multiple baseline and reversal design to assess the efficacy of a prompt--an in-chart checklist--for increasing screening, counseling, and referral for 11 risk behaviors. Chart reviews for randomly selected patients of each provider showed very low baseline levels of these services for routine visits (0.2% to 3.8%). But significant increases occurred in discussion and prescription of change (although not in referrals) during intervention. Patient visits for routine gynecologic care and birth control showed higher baseline levels (10.8% to 21.0%) and also had a significant increase in discussion of risk behaviors. However, no significant change occurred in prescription or referral for these patients. Follow-up interviews of providers supported the reliability of the results and raised issues about attitudes toward primary care health promotion. Provider variability in response to the intervention suggests that more tailored interventions might increase provision of comprehensive health promotion services by a broad spectrum of primary care providers.",
