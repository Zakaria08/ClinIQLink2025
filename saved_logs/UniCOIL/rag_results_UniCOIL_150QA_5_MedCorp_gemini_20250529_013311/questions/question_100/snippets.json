        "content": "Oncoplastic surgery Oncoplastic surgery is an important consideration in breast-conserving surgery that integrates plastic surgery principles into breast cancer surgery in order to preserve aesthetic outcomes and quality of life, without compromising local control of the cancer. It is based on three surgical principles: ideal breast cancer surgery with free tumor margins, immediate breast reconstruction, and immediate symmetry with the other breast. Oncoplastic approaches to breast-conserving surgery may require a close partnership among surgeons who specialize in surgical oncology and plastic surgery. Oncoplastic surgery is not only limited to breast-conserving surgery, as the techniques and principles of plastic surgery can be applied to mastectomy as well. As of 2017, there had been no randomized controlled trials to compare oncoplastic breast-conserving surgery to traditional breast conserving surgery techniques.",

        "title": "Breast Reconstruction Expander Implant -- Indications",
        "content": "Most patients are candidates for expanders and implants, and some patients will elect this option even if autologous tissue reconstruction is also possible. [3] The ideal candidate is a thin female undergoing bilateral mastectomy or a thin female undergoing unilateral mastectomy with little to no ptosis of the contralateral breast; the latter indication is to facilitate the final symmetry between the breasts, as a ptotic breast is extremely challenging to recreate with an implant. [4] Obese patients and patients with very large contralateral breasts may complicate the expander and implant results both in terms of final breast shape/definition and intraoperative placement. The expansion process may fail to obtain symmetry of the new breast pocket or satisfactorily define the new breast owing to thick subcutaneous fat deposits. The patient can often undergo the procedure immediately following the mastectomy but can also choose a delayed repair in a subsequent surgery if they are unsure if they desire reconstruction or if they wish to definitively know their need for any adjuvant radiation based on final pathologic results after mastectomy. The principal benefit of the immediate expansion is the avoidance of an additional general anesthetic. Additionally, it may be possible for the plastic surgeon and breast surgeon to collaborate on the best technique to retain as much native skin envelope as possible. However, it must be emphasized the reconstruction can in no way compromise the oncologic safety of the mastectomy. The surgeon's primary goal is the successful cure of the patient's breast cancer; reconstruction can always be re-addressed if surprises are encountered at the time of mastectomy. [5] [6] [7]",

        "content": "We retrospectively reviewed our experience with immediate breast reconstruction in 103 consecutive patients with stage 0 or I breast carcinoma between May 1983 and April 1988. Two reconstructive techniques were used, that is, either tissue expansion with secondary prosthesis implantation (60%) or transverse rectus abdominis musculocutaneous (TRAM) flap (40%). Chemotherapy was administered in 22% of patients without delay or compromise. The mean length of follow-up is 30 months. The complication rate was equal for both groups (24%) with infection being most common in the group of patients with tissue expansion and partial flap necrosis being most common in the group of patients with TRAM flaps. Aesthetic results were superior with use of the TRAM flap. Our experience concurs with previous reports that documented satisfactory results with immediate breast reconstruction without compromising further therapy. We conclude that although the tissue expansion technique yields acceptable results, the TRAM flap yields superior aesthetic results in terms of both appearance and consistency.",

In univariate analysis, the overall and/or relapse-free survival of reconstructed patients with four or more positive axillary lymph nodes or those with menopausal status were significantly inferior compared with those of nonreconstructed patients. In multivariate analysis, however, the immediate breast reconstruction did not appear to have a significant adverse influence on all patients, and on the subgroups stratified by menopausal status or axillary lymph node metastases. Therefore, it was concluded that MIBR using a musculocutaneous flap did not compromise the survival of patients with breast cancer.",
