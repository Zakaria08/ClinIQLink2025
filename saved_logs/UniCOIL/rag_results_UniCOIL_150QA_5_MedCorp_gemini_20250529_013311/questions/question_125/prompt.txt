Document 1 (Title: Proton Satria): Trim levels were LSi, GLi, GLSi and SEi. The base-specification LSi had the 1.3-litre 12-valve engine only: GLi versions got the 1.5-litre 12-valve engine in addition to the 1.3-litre: whilst GLSi and SEi versions got the 1.6 16v engine as well as the 1.5 12v. A later facelift version featured a redesigned rear end, different from that of the original Mirage. These were launched in 1996 in Malaysia and later in other countries, and new XLi, S XLi and GTi trim levels were available. New 1.3 12v, 1.5 12v, and 1.6 16v petrol engines were available.

Document 3 (Title: Hepatitis B -- Treatment / Management -- Management): Acute hepatitis B infection is self cleared in 95% of healthy adults. Management is supportive in a majority of patients. Patients with severe acute disease (2 of the 3: bilirubin more than 10 mg/dl, INR more than 1.6 and hepatic encephalopathy) and protracted acute severe disease (total bilirubin more than 3 mg/dl or direct bilirubin more than 1.5 mg/dl, INR more than 1.5, hepatic encephalopathy, or ascites) need antiviral treatment.
Document 4 (Title: Influence of scheduling, dose, and volume of administration of a perfluorochemical emulsion on tumor response to radiation therapy.): Studies were carried out with a new, concentrated perfluorochemical emulsion (PFCE) of the perfluorochemical F44E (48% V/V). When given at 4, 1.6, or 1 g/kg in undiluted injection volumes iv 1 hr prior to a range of single doses of radiation with inspired carbogen dose modifying factors (DMF's) based on tumor growth delay (TGD) in the Lewis lung tumor of 2.5, 1.7, and 1.5, respectively, were produced. When the PFC dose was administered in a volume of 0.2 ml, the dose modifying factors produced by 4 g/kg (0.1 ml undiluted) did not change significantly (2.6), but the dose modifying factors produced by 1.6 g/kg (0.04 ml undiluted) and by 1.0 g/kg (0.025 ml undiluted) increased significantly to 2.0 and 1.8 (p less than 0.05), respectively. Using the tumor excision assay at 24 hr post treatment in the FSaIIC fibrosarcoma, administration of 6, 4, or 2 g/kg in 0.2 ml injections plus carbogen breathing 1 hr prior to and during treatment resulted in dose modifying factors of 1.5, 1.6, and 1.3, respectively.

Document 5 (Title: Cytotoxic and radiosensitizing effects  of hypoxic cell sensitizers on EMT6 mouse mammary tumour cells in vivo and in vitro.): The radiosensitizing activities and toxicities of misonidazole, metronidazole, 2-Methythio-3-nitropyrrole (3NPR), 2-amino-5-nitrothiazole (ANT) and 2,5-dinitroimidazole (KA121) were studied using EMT6 tumour cells and BALB/c KaRw mice. For 10(-4)M concentrations of the drugs, the DMF's for hypoxic cells were: Misonidazole, 1.6; 3NPR, 1.5, ANT, 1.5; KA121, 1.8. The OER was 3.2. In general, the drugs were toxic to hypoxic cells and were not toxic to aerobic cells at 10(-3)M for 24 h. The LD50's in BALB/c KaRw mice were: misonidazole, 1500 mg/kg; 3NPR, 350 mg/kg ANT, 420 mg/kg. In vivo, 1 mg/g misonidazole or metronidazole reduced the terminal slope of the tumour cell survival curve by a factor of 2.2 or 1.6 respectively.
