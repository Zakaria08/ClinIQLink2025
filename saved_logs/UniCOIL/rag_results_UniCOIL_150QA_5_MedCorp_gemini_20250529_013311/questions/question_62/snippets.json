        "content": "Laboratory investigations for OGs are generally nonspecific but may be performed to assess general health and rule out other conditions. Routine tests like a complete blood count and serum electrolytes can help identify complications such as anemia, infections, or electrolyte disturbances that may arise from the tumor or seizures. However, there are no definitive blood biomarkers for OGs in clinical practice. Genetic markers, such as glial fibrillary acidic protein and Olig2, may be used in research settings to help understand the tumor’s molecular characteristics. These markers are more useful in differentiating OGs from other gliomas, but histological and molecular analysis remains the primary diagnostic approach.",

Identification of extracellular proteases has historically been the basis for the differentiation between the two strains of D. nodosus Benign strains of D. nodosus have proteases that are thermolabile and virulent strains have proteases that are thermostable and have higher elastase activity. Performance of laboratory testing to diagnose specific strains of D. nodosus by determining the protease thermostability and elastase activity are not routinely performed due to the difficulty of the laboratory procedures that often yield inconsistent results. In addition, the time it takes to perform laboratory-based tests to determine the virulotype of D. nodosus is slow and may not be helpful to effectively treat or isolate the infected animal(s) and to prevent spread to",

Recent studies indicate that HSCs also have the potential to differentiate into multiple non–blood cell lineages and contribute to the cellular regeneration of various tissues and multiple organs. During embryonic development, HSCs are present in the circulation and undergo tissue-specific differentiation in different organs. Human HSCs have been isolated from umbilical cord blood, fetal liver, and fetal and adult bone marrow. In the adult, HSCs have the potential to repair tissues under pathologic conditions (e.g., is-chemic injury, organ failure). Human HSCs express specific molecular marker proteins such as CD34 and CD90 and at the same time do not express lineage-specific markers (Lin–) that are found on lymphocytes, granulocytes, monocytes, megakaryocytes, and erythroid cells. It is now believed that human HSC can be identified by the Lin , CD34, CD90 , and CD38 cellsurface markers. HSCs are not identifiable in the routine preparation; however,",

        "content": "An enzyme immunological methodology for the direct and simultaneous estimation of serum cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone-sulphate (DHEA-S) useful for the biochemical differential diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome has been developed. The combined estimation of both steroids is more economical in time, work and materials than two separate assays. Two solid phases, a microtitre plate and a covering transferable needle lid system were used in the present procedure. Both solid phases are first coated with anti-rabbit IgG and then each with a specific antiserum. Horseradish peroxidase was used as marker enzyme and tetramethylbenzidine as the chromogen for measuring enzyme activity. No extraction or deproteinization steps are involved. The turn around time for 41 samples (in duplicate) is 3 h. The detection limit of the assay is 5 pg/well for cortisol and 10 pg/well for DHEA-S. Results of the present method correlated well (cortisol, r = 0.95; DHEA-S, r = 0.98) with those of commercial radioimmunoassays using iodinated labels. Thus, this technique offers a convenient non-isotopic procedure in the routine clinical laboratory.",

In the interval between epileptic seizures, the EEG, particularly if repeated once or twice, shows some degree of abnormality in 50 to 75 percent of cases, whereas it should be normal between syncopal attacks. Sometimes one must resort to continuous EEG monitoring to clarify the situation (this can be combined with continuous ECG recording). Another useful laboratory marker of a seizure, especially if unwitnessed, is an elevation of the serum creatine kinase (CK) concentration; such a finding occurs only infrequently in the rare case of syncope associated with extensive muscle trauma. Elevated prolactin levels have not proved discriminating enough for routine use in separating seizure from syncope but remain useful in distinguishing both of these from other causes of loss of consciousness, particularly hysteria, in which such elevations do not occur.",
