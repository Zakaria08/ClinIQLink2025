Document 1 (Title: VNG/ENG Testing -- Normal and Critical Findings -- Saccade, Tracking, and Optokinetic Tests): The saccade, tracking, and optokinetic tests measure nonvestibular eye movements. An abnormal response during any of these tests indicates a central lesion. Fixed or random sudden rapid eye movements (saccades), the inability to smoothly track a stimulus, and nystagmus produced by moving objects indicate a central nervous system abnormality. A saccade velocity of less than 275 °/s is considered pathological. The normal range of saccade accuracy is between 80% and 134%. Saccade latency values of greater than 260 ms are considered abnormal. Smooth pursuit is described by gain, defined as the ratio of eye velocity to target velocity; the normal range is defined as 0.9 to 1.0 for target velocities less than 20 °/s. [14]
Document 2 (Title: Physiology_Levy): The optokinetic reflex (OKR) is a second mechanism by which the CNS stabilizes the visual scene on the retina, and it often works in conjunction with the VOR. Whereas the VOR is activated only by head motion, the OKR is activated by movement of the visual scene, whether caused by motion of the scene itself or by head motion. Specifically, the sensory stimulus for this reflex is slip of the visual scene on the retina as detected by motion-sensitive retinal ganglion cells. An example of the former occurs when you are sitting in a train and a train on the adjacent track begins moving: Your eyes rotate to keep the image of the neighboring car stable. This often leads to a sensation that you are moving (this is not entirely surprising because OKR circuits feed into the same circuits as used by the vestibular system).
Document 3 (Title: Analysis of a naturally occurring asymmetry in vertical smooth pursuit eye movements in a monkey.): 1. We have investigated the mechanism of a directional deficit in vertical pursuit eye movements in a monkey that was unable to match upward eye speed to target speed but that had pursuit within the normal range for downward or horizontal target motion. Except for a difference in the axis of deficient pursuit, the symptoms in this monkey were similar to those seen with lesions in the frontal or parietal lobes of the cerebral cortex in humans or monkeys. Our evaluation of vertical pursuit in this monkey suggests a new interpretation for the role of the frontal and parietal lobes in pursuit. 2. The up/down asymmetry was most pronounced for target motion at speeds greater than or equal to 2 degree/s. For target motion at 15 or 30 degree/s, upward step-ramp target motion evoked a brief upward smooth eye acceleration, followed by tracking that consisted largely of saccades. Downward step-ramp target motion evoked a prolonged smooth eye acceleration, followed by smooth, accurate tracking. 3. Varying the amplitude o...
Document 4 (Title: Amblyopia): These deficits are usually specific to the amblyopic eye. Subclinical deficits of the "better" eye have also been demonstrated. People with amblyopia also have problems of binocular vision such as limited stereoscopic depth perception and usually have difficulty seeing the three-dimensional images in hidden stereoscopic displays such as autostereograms. Perception of depth, from monocular cues such as size, perspective, and motion parallax remains normal. Cause Amblyopia has three main causes: Strabismic: by strabismus (misaligned eyes) Refractive: by anisometropia (difference of a certain degree of nearsightedness, farsightedness, or astigmatism), or by significant amount of equal refractive error in both eyes Deprivational: by deprivation of vision early in life by vision-obstructing disorders such as congenital cataract
Document 5 (Title: Cerebral achromatopsia): Cerebral achromatopsia is a type of color-blindness caused by damage to the cerebral cortex of the brain, rather than abnormalities in the cells of the eye's retina. It is often confused with congenital achromatopsia but underlying physiological deficits of the disorders are completely distinct. A similar, but distinct, deficit called color agnosia exists in which a person has intact color perception (as measured by a matching task) but has deficits in color recognition, such as knowing which color they are looking at.
