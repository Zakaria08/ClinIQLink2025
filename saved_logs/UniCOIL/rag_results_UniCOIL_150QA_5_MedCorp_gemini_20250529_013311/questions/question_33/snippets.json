        "content": "His physical exam revealed clear lungs and a normal heart exam on auscultation. His abdomen was soft and non-tender, and his skin was warm and dry with no rash. He had 2 plus pitting edema at the ankles. Initial laboratory data was consistent with acute kidney injury (AKI) with worsening creatinine from 1.2 to 1.6 over 1 month and nephrotic range proteinuria. Serologies for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, anti-nuclear antibody (ANA), c-ANCA, serine protease 3 (PR3) IgG, myeloperoxidase antibody (MPO), and complement levels were sent. He was started on losartan for proteinuria with plans for renal biopsy; however, he was lost to follow up. The patient then presented two weeks later with worsening edema to his waist, continued weight gain, mild hemoptysis, and streaks of blood in the stool. Physical examination now showed worsening pitting edema up to his waist with new non-pruritic, erythematous excoriations on the medial aspect of his thighs bilaterally. He was admitted to the hospital with concern for worsening vasculitis. He was started on oral prednisone and underwent a renal biopsy. For his edema, he was started on diuretics to which he responded well. Due to persistent leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing was performed to complete the workup.",

        "content": "Effects of carbon disulphide (CS2) on conduction velocity in sciatic and tibial nerve were investigated in rats exposed to CS2 vapour at concentrations of 0.9 mg/l or 1.6 mg/l of air for periods of 1.5, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. The conduction velocity was measured on the day following each exposure period, and again, three and six months after the last day of exposure. The majority of exposed rats showed a reduction in conduction velocity on the day after exposure: the extent of this reduction was dependent on the CS2 concentration and the duration of exposure. Exposure for 1.5 months to 1.6 mg CS2/l produced temporary and fully reversible impairment of conduction velocity. Increased exposure to CS2 (3,6 or 9 months at 1.6 mg/l; 6 or 12 months at 0.9 mg/l CS2 in air) caused a reduction in velocity which was only partially reversible.",
