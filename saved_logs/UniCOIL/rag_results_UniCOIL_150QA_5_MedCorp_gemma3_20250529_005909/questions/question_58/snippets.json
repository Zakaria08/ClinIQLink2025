        "content": "Missense and nonsense mutations in the apoA-I gene are present in some patients with low plasma levels of HDL-C (usually 15–30 mg/ dL), but are a rare cause of low plasma HDL-C levels. Most individuals with low plasma HDL-C levels due to missense mutations in apoA-I do not appear to have premature CHD. Patients who are heterozygous for an Arg173Cys substitution in apoA-I (so-called apoA-IMilano) have very low plasma levels of HDL-C due to impaired LCAT activation and accelerated clearance of the HDL particles containing the abnormal apoA-I. Despite having very low plasma levels of HDL-C, these individuals do not have an increased risk of premature CHD. A few selected missense mutations in apoA-I and apoA-II promote the formation of amyloid fibrils, which can cause systemic amyloidosis.",

        "content": "Methylation: In patients with CRC and absent MLH1 expression on IHC, approximately 75% of cases are sporadic due to a BRAF gene mutation, rather than Lynch syndrome. Sporadic MSI-H CRCs typically exhibit epigenetic loss of MLH1 gene expression caused by hypermethylation of the MLH1 promoter. The presence of a BRAF mutation is often associated with this somatic loss of MLH1 . If both BRAF mutation and MLH1 promoter hypermethylation tests are negative, genetic testing for Lynch syndrome is warranted. However, if either test result is positive, the likelihood of Lynch syndrome is extremely low. [82]",

        "title": "Characterization of the hydroperoxide response observed in mouse skin treated with tumor promoters in vivo.",
        "content": "The production of hydroperoxides is rapidly increased and remains at 200-280% of the control 1-24 h after the second daily application of 17 nmol of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) to mouse skin in vivo. The levels of hydroperoxides are increased 1.63-, 2.64-, 4.07-, and 4.31-fold 18 h after one, two, three, or four applications of TPA at 24-h intervals, respectively. The hydroperoxide response to TPA observed in whole skin reflects almost entirely the increased hydroperoxide-producing activity of the epidermis. Such hydroperoxide responses are triggered to various degrees by the anthrone derivatives and the phorbol esters and diterpene with complete and/or stage 2 tumor-promoting activities but not by the agents with only inflammatory, hyperplastic or stage 1 tumor-promoting activities. However, the Ca2+ ionophores A23187 and ionomycin are potent inducers of hydroperoxide formation. Several discrepancies are observed between the hydroperoxide response to TPA and the known effects of the tumor promoter on ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) induction. In contrast to the refractory state against ODC induction caused by TPA treatments repeated at intervals of less than 48 h, the time interval required for recovery of the hydroperoxide response to TPA in TPA-pretreated skins is only 5 h. The stimulatory effects of A23187, ionomycin and various diacylglycerols (DAGs) on hydroperoxide production do not correlate with their ODC-inducing activities. The increasing susceptibilities of C57BL/6, CF-1, and SEN-CAR mice to skin tumor promotion correlate with their hydroperoxide responses but not with their ODC responses to TPA. alpha-Difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) and other inhibitors of TPA-induced ODC activity fail to alter hydroperoxide production whereas the compounds that inhibit the hydroperoxide response to TPA, such as fluocinolone acetonide, have no or only minimal inhibitory activity against ODC induction. This would suggest that the hydroperoxide response to TPA does not require ODC induction and may not be essential for ODC induction. The hydroperoxide response to TPA is mimicked, but to a lesser degree, by the activator of protein kinase C, 1,2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycerol, and inhibited by verapamil, trifluoperazine, and palmitoylcarnitine. Populations of TPA-treated keratinocytes, therefore, may be responsible not only for ODC activation but also for hydroperoxide production. However, these two responses, which involve, at least in part, Ca2+ mobilization and protein kinase C activation and play important roles in the mechanism of skin tumor promotion, do not appear to be correlated.",

        "content": "The mechanism of a trans-acting mutation, dgkR1, which causes a 7-fold elevation of diacylglycerol kinase activity in membranes (Raetz, C. R. H., Kantor, G. D., Nishijima, M., and Jones, M. L. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 2109-2112) was investigated by direct measurement of diacylglycerol kinase polypeptide by high performance liquid chromatography and by construction of fusions of the dgkA promoter to beta-galactosidase and galactokinase. The dgkR1 mutation was demonstrated to act by increasing the transcription of the structural gene for diacylglycerol kinase, dgkA. Additionally, sn-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase activities were shown to be decreased 30-50% in membranes from dgkR1 mutant strains. Increased diacylglycerol levels occurred when cells were grown on low osmolarity media. This did not affect dgkA expression. In a dgkR+ background, enhanced expression of sn-1,2-diacylglycerol kinase activity in cells containing a high copy number plasmid bearing dgkA decreased sn-1,2-diacylglycerol levels. However, overproduction of diacylglycerol kinase in a dgkR1 genetic background did not affect diacylglycerol levels, suggesting that the dgkR1 mutation affects diacylglycerol metabolism by mechanisms additional to enhancement of dgkA transcription.",
