The instructional model has seven components: objectives standards anticipatory set teaching (input, modeling, checking for understanding) guided practice/monitoring closure independent practice The elements of effective instruction are very similar to those of the instructional model, featuring seven components of teaching and behavioral objectives: objectives set(hook) standards/expectations teaching (input, modeling/demo, direction giving, and checking for understanding) guided practice closure independent practice Hunter was the creator of Instructional Theory into Practice (ITIP). ITIP is a teaching model on inservice/staff development program widely used during the 1970s and 1980s.",

        "title": "Task Trainers in Procedural Skills Acquisition in Medical Simulation -- Curriculum Development",
        "content": "Using a task trainer can allow for the creation of a simple teaching model leading to a standardized teaching approach and, ultimately, a sustainable outcome. For many years, the standard of practice in the medical community has been Halstead's \"See one, Do one, Teach one\" but this has become less acceptable, particularly when invasive procedures and high-risk care are involved. [4] [5] A more efficient model for teaching procedures that combines multiple aspects of adult learning is Peyton's 4 step approach (see Figure 1). [6] In this model, a teacher can demonstrate the procedure on the task trainer to the learner with no commentary as the first step.",

        "content": "An anatomical model for teaching the practical aspects of routine oral surgery in a clinical or laboratory environment, is described. Replaceable sections allow the model to be rapidly re-used so that successive students may practise procedures such as incisions, flap reflection, bone removal, tooth removal, apicectomy and suturing. Keeping the cost per procedure to a minimum was considered to be of fundamental importance and this has been achieved through the use of 'factory produced' replacement parts.",

        "content": "In this study 348 patients attending outpatient clinics at Royal Hobart Hospital were interviewed, assessed in their breast self examination (BSE) technique, and taught BSE by the authors. A standard method of assessing BSE competence was devised applying the criteria outlined in a Tasmanian Cancer Committee brochure (Further reading) using a silicone breast examination teaching model. The measurable benefits of this form of teaching BSE were shown to persist for seven to 10 months in 11 women who re-attended clinics and were tested a second time after receiving instruction by the authors in the initial part of the study.",
