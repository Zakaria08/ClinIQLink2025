Document 1 (Title: Synthesis of sorbistin analogues.): D-Galactose was converted into the glycosylating agents 4-azido-2,3-di-O-benzyl-4-deoxy-6-O-propionyl-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl chloride (11) and the methyl beta-D-thiopyranoside 19. Condensation of 11 with 2,5-diazido-1,6-di-O-benzoyl-2,5-di-deoxy-L-iditol in the presence of mercury salts gave 24% of 2,5-diazido-3-O-(4-azido-2,3-di-O-benzyl-4-deoxy-6-O-propionyl-alp ha-D- glucopyranosyl)-1,6-di-O-benzoyl-2,5-dideoxy-L-iditol. Methyl trifluoromethanesulfonate-promoted glycosylation of 1,3-diazido-2-O-benzyl-1,3-dideoxy-5,6-O-isopropylidene-D-gulit ol with 19 in the presence of 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylpyridine gave 1,3-diazido-4-O-(4-azido-2,3-di-O-benzyl-4-deoxy-6-O-propionyl-alp ha-D- glucopyranosyl)-2-O-benzyl-1,3-dideoxy-5,6-O-isopropylidene-D-gulitol (42), whereas, in the absence of base, migration of the O-isopropylidene group occurred, affording 1,3-diazido-6-O-(4-azido-2,3-di-O-benzyl-4-deoxy-6-O-propionyl-alp ha-D- glucopyranosyl)-2-O-benzyl-1,3-dideoxy-4,5-O-isopropylidene-D-gulitol in addition to 42.
Document 2 (Title: Pseudoappendicitis -- Pathophysiology): Y enterocolitica has approximately 60 serogroups typed by their O and H lipopolysaccharide surface antigens. Most subtypes are nonpathogenic to humans. Pathologic serogroups in humans include but are not limited to O:3, O:8, and O:9. Animals and humans infected with this bacteria who never develop symptoms or convalesce from a symptomatic episode may become carriers. [8]
Document 3 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): O−Nitric oxide (NO) Vasodilator, platelet inhibitor, immune regulator, neurotransmitter Oxidant and nitrating agent Can form from nonspecific donation of an electron from metals to NO Exhibits NO-like effects, possibly by first being oxidized to NO Anesthetic Auto-oxidation product of NO that can nitrosylate protein thiols Stable oxidation product of NO Slowly metabolized to nitrosothiols, and decomposes to NO at acidic pH Stable oxidation product of NO N=O•O=N−O−O−N−=O N−=N+=O O=N=O−Peroxynitrite (NO3 −) Nitrite (NO2 −) Nitrate (NO3 −) Nitroxyl anion (NO−) Nitrous oxide (N2O) Dinitrogen trioxide (N2O3) O=N−N+=O O=N+−O−O− arginine-binding site. Since each of the NOS isoforms has high structural similarity, most of these inhibitors do not exhibit selectivity for individual NOS isoforms. In inflammatory disorders and sepsis (see below), inhibition of the iNOS isoform is potentially beneficial, whereas in neurodegenerative conditions, nNOS-specific inhibitors may be useful. However,
Document 4 (Title: Otholobium): Conservation The conservation status of forty-eight species has been assessed for South Africa, one of which has two subspecies. One of those subspecies occurs in the mountains of eastern Africa but does not occur in South Africa. The survival of twenty-four taxa is considered to be of least concern: O. acuminatum, O. arborescens, O. bracteolatum, O. caffrum, O. candicans, O. flexuosum, O. foliosum subsp. gazense, O. fumeum, O. hirtum, O. mundianum, O. nigricans, O. obliquum, O. parviflorum, O. pictum, O. polyphyllum, O. polystictum, O. sericeum, O. spicatum, O. stachyerum, O. striatum, O. trianthum, O. virgatum, O. wilmsii and O. zeyheri. Four species are regarded as near threatened: O. accrescens, O. bolusii, O. spissum and O. swartbergense. Seven species are rare: O. carneum, O. fruticans, O. heterosepalum, O. macradenium, O. nitens, O. pustulatum and O. racemosum. Four species are regarded as vulnerable: O. dreweae, O. hamatum, O. lucens and O. rotundifolium.
Document 5 (Title: Haplogroup O-M176): O-M176(x47z) has been found in approximately 3.5% to 9.9% of Japanese males. However, most of those individuals probably belong to subclades of O-K10(x47z). O-K10 The majority of extant members of O-M176 belong to the subclade O-K10 (aka O-F3356 aka O-F1204). O-K10 (TMRCA 7000 [95% CI 8000 <-> 6200] ybp according to YFull or 7020 years according to 23mofang) subsumes the prolific subclades O-47z, which occurs with especially high frequency in Japan, and O-L682, which occurs with especially high frequency in Korea, in addition to the relatively rare subclades O-CTS10687, which has been found in Japan, Korea, and China, and O-K3, which has been found among Han Chinese mostly in South Central China. O-L682 and O-K3 are linked by 18 SNPs that define the O-K4 clade, and thus their members are more closely related to one another by paternal lineage than any of them is related to any member of O-47z or O-CTS10687.
