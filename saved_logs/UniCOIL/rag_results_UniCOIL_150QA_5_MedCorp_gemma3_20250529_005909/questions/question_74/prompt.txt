Document 1 (Title: Atypical facial pain, ectasia of the basilar artery, and baclofen: a case report.): Atypical facial pain is a clinical syndrome of facial pain that has been related to depression but whose pathogenesis is not known. We describe a 72-year-old woman with a chronic facial pain, and ectasia and left sided deviation of the basilar artery, that responded dramatically to baclofen. This case suggests that vascular compression of the trigeminal nerve may be one of the mechanisms producing this syndrome and in these cases it might respond to baclofen.
Document 2 (Title: Pain Theory -- Definition/Introduction): Although inflammation and pain are an essential part of healing (acute pain), in some circumstances, they can lead to negative effects. Several mechanisms involving the activation of peripheral and central sensitization pathways through the sensitization of peripheral nociceptors, and alterations in spinal dorsal horn neurons, and central nervous system (CNS) brain areas, can trigger a pathogenetic cascade that ends with the development of chronic pain. Again, pieces of evidence suggest the paramount role of the environment (i.e., epigenetic) and genetics. [2] [3] Thus, the chronicity of pain is the effect of changes in pain processing through transcription and transduction processes. As a consequence, chronic pain is no longer simply a symptom but becomes itself a disease. Currently, in the United States, estimates are that 100 million individuals suffer from the negative effects of protracted courses of pain and inflammation. [3] This epidemic is growing at an alarmingly fast rate and is taking a significan...
Document 3 (Title: Neurology_Adams): Facial pain of the “atypical type,” like other chronic pain of indeterminate cause, requires close observation of the patient, looking for lesions such as nasopharyngeal carcinoma or apical lung carcinoma to become apparent. The pain can be managed by the conservative methods outlined in the preceding chapter and not by destructive surgery. Antidepressants may be helpful, especially if the patient displays obsessive characteristics in relation to the pain; some European neurologists favor clomipramine for various facial and scalp pains.

Document 4 (Title: A. V. Apkarian): Dr. Apkarian's early work with primate electrophysiology established that thalamic neurons can be physiologically characterized based on morphology and projections to the cortex, which led to the discovery that the thalamus dynamically encodes nociceptive stimuli in response to features of sensory stimuli. In the 1990s, his research transitioned to human brain imaging-based investigations of pain qualia and neural mechanisms underlying chronic pain. Dr. Apkarian's body of research was pivotal in establishing neuroplasticity as a mechanism of chronic pain, with notable findings including: in 2004 his group first identified grey matter changes related to chronic back pain, in 2008 his group first described resting state network changes in chronic pain patients and white matter abnormalities related to complex regional pain syndrome, and in 2012 his group published the first evidence that functional connectivity between the medial prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens prospectively
Document 5 (Title: Oral medicine): Example conditions that oral medicine is concerned with are lichen planus, Behçet's disease and pemphigus vulgaris. Moreover, it involves the diagnosis and follow-up of pre-malignant lesions of the oral cavity, such as leukoplakias or erythroplakias and of chronic and acute pain conditions such as paroxysmal neuralgias, continuous neuralgias, myofascial pain, atypical facial pain, autonomic cephalalgias, headaches and migraines. Another aspect of the field is managing the dental and oral condition of medically compromised patients such as cancer patients suffering from related oral mucositis, bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaws or oral pathology related to radiation therapy. Additionally, it is involved in the diagnosis and management of dry mouth conditions (such as Sjögren's syndrome) and non-dental chronic orofacial pain, such as burning mouth syndrome, trigeminal neuralgia and temporomandibular joint disorder.
