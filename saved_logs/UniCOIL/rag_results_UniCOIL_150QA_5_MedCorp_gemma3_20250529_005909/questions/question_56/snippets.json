        "content": "Surgical repair of uretero-enteric strictures in patients with enteric conduit urinary diversion (incidence rate 4-8%) is difficult and has a high morbidity. With the development of endo-urologic techniques and ureteral catheters, long-term insertion of stents in the treatment of strictures has become possible and safe. We have performed long-term uretero-enteric stenting with 7-8 Fr double-J catheters in 5 patients with 6 strictures: 3 ureteroileal and 3 uretero-colic. In three cases (2 colonic conduits, 1 ileal conduit) the stent was inserted anterogradely following intercostal renal percutaneous punctures and dilatation of the stricture with teflon dilators (1 case), balloon catheter (1 case), or following the incision of the stricture (1 case). In one patient with a double uretero-enteric stricture of the ileal conduit, guide-wires were successfully inserted retrogradely which permitted subsequent high pressure dilatation of the uretero-ileal strictures with a 15 Fr balloon catheter. We used the same approach in another patient with a right uretero-colic stricture. The catheters were left indwelling for 7 to 35 months and were changed every 3 months with no remarkable observations other than 3 episodes of fever which quickly resolved with antibiotic treatment. Although is has been reported that uretero-enteric strictures are particularly refractory to endo-urologic treatment and a significant morbidity rate has been associated with long-term ureteral stenting, our results show that the approach was well-tolerated by all of the patients.",

        "content": "The organisms that cause traveler’s diarrhea vary considerably with location (Table 160-3), as does the pattern of antimicrobial resistance. In all areas, enterotoxigenic and enteroaggregative strains of E. coli are the most common isolates from persons with the classic secretory traveler’s diarrhea syndrome. Infection with Campylobacter jejuni is especially common in areas of Asia. Closed and semi-closed communities, including day-care centers, schools, residential facilities, and cruise ships, are important settings for outbreaks of enteric infections. Norovirus, which is highly contagious and robust in surviving on surfaces, is the most common etiologic agent associated with outbreaks of acute gastroenteritis. Other common organisms, often spread by fecal-oral contact in such communities, are Shigella,",

        "content": "In 2015, pilots Leonid Tiukhtyaev and Troy Bradley arrived safely in Baja California, Mexico, after a journey of 10,711 km. The two men, originally from Russia and the United States of America respectively, started in Japan and flew with a helium balloon over the Pacific. In 160 hours and 34 minutes, the balloon, named \"Two Eagles\", arrived in Mexico, setting the longest distance and duration records for gas balloons. On other planets The Soviet Union space probes Vega 1 and Vega 2 each dropped a helium balloon with scientific experiments into the atmosphere of Venus in 1985. The balloons first entered the atmosphere and descended to about 50 km, then inflated for level flight. Otherwise the flight was uncontrolled. Each balloon relayed wind and atmospheric conditions for 46 hours of a possible 60-hour electric battery power budget.",

The second nurse verification measure was retained, with the second nurse instructed to double-check all doses, pump settings, drug names, and concentrations before administration of any drugs. Moreover, the RCA recommended that all medication orders be provided in writing and entered in the electronic medical record using computerized provider order entry (CPOE) systems, regardless of the situation's urgency, to avoid dosing errors. The RCA team emphasized that verbal communication for medication administration should always be avoided. If verbal communication is necessary or unavoidable, the RCA recommended that the nurse taking the order read back the order given to the prescribing physician to minimize any prescribing errors.",

        "content": "The British added two refinements to their balloons, \"Double Parachute Link\" (DPL) and \"Double Parachute/Ripping\" (DP/R). The former was triggered by the shock of an enemy bomber snagging the cable, causing that section of cable to be explosively released complete with parachutes at either end; the combined weight and drag bringing down the aircraft. The latter was intended to render the balloon safe if it broke free accidentally. The heavy mooring cable would separate at the balloon and fall to the ground under a parachute; at the same time a panel would be ripped away from the balloon causing it to deflate and fall independently to the ground. In January 1945, during Royal Navy Fleet Air Arm raids on the Palembang oil refineries, the British aircrews were surprised by massive use of barrage balloons in the Japanese defences. These were spherical and smaller than the British type. One Grumman Avenger was destroyed, and its crew killed, from striking a balloon cable.",
