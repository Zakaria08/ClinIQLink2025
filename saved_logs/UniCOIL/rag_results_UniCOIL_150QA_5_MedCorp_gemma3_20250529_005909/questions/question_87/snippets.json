The subsequent discovery in 1980 that 18F-FDG accumulates in tumors underpins the evolution of PET as a major clinical tool in cancer diagnosis. 18F-FDG is now the standard radiotracer used for PET neuroimaging and cancer patient management. The images can be assessed by a nuclear medicine physician or radiologist to provide diagnoses of various medical conditions.",

        "title": "[The drug sensitivity of human gastric cancer implanted into the subcutis and stomach wall of nude mice].",
        "content": "This study was designed to establish a model able to predict the clinical efficacy of anticancer agents against cancers of specific organ. Seven weeks old, male BALB/c nude mice were implanted with 1 X 10(6) cells of human gastric cancer G/F into either their subcutis or the stomach wall. Fourteen days after the implantation, the mice were injected daily once for 10 days with peplomycin or mitomycin C. Peplomycin was effective on the subcutaneous tumors with an inhibition rate of 26 and 64% at doses of 1.5 and 6.0 mg/kg, respectively. Peplomycin was ineffective on the tumors in the stomach wall. Mitomycin C was ineffective on the subcutaneous tumors, but effective on the tumors in the stomach wall and the inhibition rate was 52 and 63% at doses of 0.13 and 0.5 mg/kg, respectively. Study on the distribution of peplomycin and mitomycin C to those tumors revealed that peplomycin and mitomycin C levels in the subcutaneous tumors were 2 to 7 times and about 3 times higher than those in the stomach wall, respectively. Thus, drug distribution could not explain the differences in drug sensitivity. The sensitivity of the tumor in the stomach wall to peplomycin and mitomycin C was consistent with the clinical efficacy of these drugs against human gastric cancers. This suggests that models where the tumors are implanted into its original organ are useful for predicting clinical efficacy in experimental cancer chemotherapy.",

        "title": "Differentiation of residual or recurrent tumors from post-treatment changes with F-18 FDG PET.",
        "content": "Positron emission tomography (PET) with fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) was used to differentiate recurrent or residual malignant disease from the effects of cancer treatment. Transaxial images were obtained after injection of 5-10 mCi (185-370 MBq) of F-18 FDG in 68 patients (including 33 with brain tumors) whose posttreatment computed tomographic (CT) or magnetic resonance (MR) imaging findings had been suggestive of malignant disease. PET findings were correlated with surgical results in 18 patients and with the outcomes of CT, MR imaging, clinical, and laboratory 9-month follow-up studies in 50 patients. There was good agreement between F-18 FDG uptake and presence or absence of malignant disease except in four cases of brain tumors in which histologic findings could not be correlated with biologic behavior. The putative sensitivity and specificity in the 33 cases of brain tumors were 80% and 94%, respectively. The authors conclude that PET with F-18 FDG is useful in detection of previously treated metabolically active tumors but is limited in diagnosis of recurrent microscopic or metabolically inactive tumors.",
