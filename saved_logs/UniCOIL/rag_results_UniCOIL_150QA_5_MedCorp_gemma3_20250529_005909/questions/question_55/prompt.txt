Document 1 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): In addition to addressing the negative impact of smoking on fertility and pregnancy outcome, counseling about nutrition and weight is a fundamental component of infertility and pregnancy management. Both low and increased body mass index (BMI) are associated with infertility in women and with increased morbidity during pregnancy. Obesity has also been associated with infertility in men. The treatment of infertility should be tailored to the problems unique to each couple. In many situations, including unexplained infertility, mild-to-moderate endometriosis, and/or borderline semen parameters, a stepwise approach to infertility is optimal, beginning with low-risk interventions and moving to more invasive, higher risk interventions only if necessary. After determination of all infertility factors and their correction, if possible, this approach might include, in increasing order of complexity: (1) expectant management, (2) clomiphene citrate or an aromatase inhibitor (see below) with or
Document 2 (Title: Modified Ashworth Scale -- Clinical Significance): The modified Ashworth scale is a muscle tone assessment scale used to assess the resistance experienced during passive range of motion, which does not require any instrumentation and is quick to perform. [10] The MAS is the current standard for clinical assessment of extremity spasticity, and the most commonly used tool to evaluate the efficacy of pharmacologic and rehabilitation interventions for the treatment and management of spasticity among patients with SCI. [10] [8] The MAS is the gold standard for the measurement of new assessment tools.
Document 3 (Title: Noise-induced hearing loss): A systematic review of the effectiveness of interventions to promote the use of hearing protection devices such as earplugs and earmuffs among workers found that tailored interventions improve the average use of such devices when compared with no intervention. Tailored interventions involve the use of communication or other types of interventions that are specific to an individual or a group and aim to change behavior. Mixed interventions such as mailings, distribution of hearing protection devices, noise assessments, and hearing testing are also more effective in improving the use of hearing protection devices compared with hearing testing alone. Programs that increased the proportion of workers wearing hearing protection equipment did reduce overall hearing loss. Hearing conservation programs
Document 4 (Title: Multistrategy health education program to increase mammography use among women ages 65 and older.): Mammography use decreases with age although the risk of breast cancer increases with age. Medicare now provides biennial coverage for screening mammography. This study was designed to simulate the Medicare condition by subsidizing mammography among women in eight retirement communities in the metropolitan Philadelphia area. The study also measured the impact of health education interventions and the presence of a mobile mammography van on increased use of mammography. Retirement communities were assigned randomly to the control (cost subsidy alone) or experimental group (cost subsidy, mammography van, and tailored health education interventions). A total of 412 women ages 65 and older who had not had mammograms in the previous year were surveyed at baseline and 3 months later. Analytic techniques reflected the cluster nature of the randomization. Women in the experimental group were significantly more likely than the control group women to have obtained mammograms. Forty-five percent of the experimental group...
Document 5 (Title: The role of breast self-examination in breast cancer screening.): The efficacy of breast self-examination (BSE) behavior cannot be adequately evaluated until BSE proficiency is considered. Previous research supports the role of attitudinal and teaching interventions in increasing skills and frequency for BSE behavior, but more research using age-appropriate women and adequate outcome measures is needed. A preliminary analysis of data from 301 randomly selected women who were followed for 1 year after an initial teaching and/or attitudinal intervention is reported. Significant differences were obtained for attitudes toward breast cancer screening between scores before and after intervention using paired t test. Significant changes in proficiency and frequency also occurred after intervention, as well as percentage increases in nine individual BSE steps. Return demonstration scores and nodule detection are reported. Perceived barriers and confidence were significantly related to both frequency and proficiency 1 year postintervention using regression analysis. Knowledge was re...
