Document 2 (Title: Venlafaxine -- Mechanism of Action -- Pharmacokinetics): Elimination: The elimination half-life of venlafaxine varies depending on the formulation and is approximately 5±2 hours for immediate-release, 6.8±1.6 hours for extended-release besylate, and 10.7±3.2 hours for extended-release hydrochloride. However, this half-life may be prolonged in individuals with renal or hepatic dysfunction. Most venlafaxine is eliminated through urine, with about 87% of the total dose excreted through this pathway. Of this excretion, 5% is an unchanged drug, while 29% is unconjugated O -desmethyl venlafaxine and 26% as conjugated O -desmethyl venlafaxine. [13] Additionally, 27% of the total dose is excreted as minor inactive metabolites.

Document 4 (Title: Binding energetics of phosphorus-containing inhibitors of thermolysin.): The importance of a specific hydrogen bond between thermolysin and a phosphonamidate inhibitor, Z-NHCH2-PO(O-)-Leu-Leu (1) [Bartlett, P. A., &amp; Marlowe, C. K. (1987) Science (Washington D.C.) 235, 569-571], has been reevaluated. We have determined the inhibition constants (binding free energies) for thermolysin of phosphonamidate n-hexyl-P(O)(O-)-Leu-Trp-NHMe (4), phosphonate n-hexyl-P-(O)(O-)OCH(iBu)CO-Trp-NHMe (5), and phosphinates n-hexyl-P(O)(O-)CH2CH(iBu)CO-Trp-NHMe (6) and Z-NHCH2PO(O-)CH2CH(iBu)CO-Leu (3). Replacement of the P-NH group by P-CH2 (1----3 and 4----6) weakens the overall binding free energy by about 1.5 kcal/mol. A negligible difference in solvation energy has been measured for these pairs, and the basicity of the P-O- ligand for zinc in each pair remains nearly unchanged as determined by pH titration of their 31P NMR resonances. Therefore, this value of 1.5 kcal/mol can be assigned to the specific hydrogen bond known to exist between the P-NH of 1 and thermolysin [Tronrud, D. E., Holde...
Document 5 (Title: Shear stress induced membrane currents and calcium transients in human vascular endothelial cells.): We have measured membrane currents induced by shear stress together with intracellular calcium signals in endothelial cells from human umbilical cord veins. In the presence of extracellular calcium (Ca2+]o), shear stress induced an inward current at a holding potential of 0 mV which is accompanied by a rise in intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i). In the absence of extracellular calcium shear stress was unable to evoke a calcium signal but still induced a membrane current. The voltage dependence of the shear stress induced current was obtained from difference currents evoked by linear voltage ramps before and during application of shear stress. Its reversal potential Erev shifted from -2.3 +/- 0.8 mV (n = 4) in a nominally Ca2+ free solution to +1.5 +/- 1.6 mV at 1.5 mM [Ca2+]o (n = 4) and to +21.9 +/- 4.4 mV (n = 7) at 10 mM [Ca2+]o. From our data we conclude that shear stress opens an ion channel that is 12.5 +/- 2.9 (n = 7) times more permeable for calcium than for sodium or cesium.

Question: Select the correct statement(s) regarding osmolarity and osmolality:
Options:
1. Osmolarity is the number of osmoles per liter of solution
2. Osmolality is the number of osmoles per kilogram of solvent
3. In plasma, proteins representing about 7% of the total volume, osmolality equals osmolarity divided by 0.93
4. Osmolarity and osmolality can be confused for a dilute aqueous solution
5. Plasma osmolarity is measured by cryoscopy
