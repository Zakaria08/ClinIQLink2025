Document 1 (Title: Legg-Calve-Perthes Disease -- Prognosis -- Age at Onset): Usually younger age at diagnosis equals a better outcome. Patients less than 6 years old may develop a normal hip joint. Patients older than 6 years may have continued pain and subsequent arthritis. Lateral Pillar Classification (degree of femoral head involvement: A [least] to C [most]) Patients more than 8 years old and patients in lateral pillar group B or B/C (border group) do better with surgery than with nonoperative treatment. Patients less than 8 years old and patients in group B do well regardless of treatment choice. Patients in group C experience poor outcomes regarding hip condition, regardless of treatment choice.

Document 3 (Title: American Joint Committee on Cancer): Objectives The objectives of the AJCC are to: Facilitate a timely and rigorous, evidence-based process to support a biologically relevant system for classification and outcome prediction of cancer that is compatible with systems of cancer population surveillance. Proactively educate the oncology community through the development and delivery of effective programs and products to guide patient care. Promulgate research and serve as the clearinghouse to support the development of clinically relevant predictive tools, prognostic factors, and other indicators that classify and predict cancer. Foster collaborative relationships with AJCC member organizations and organizations with similar objectives in support of systems to diagnose and treat cancer. Support and be responsive to public and private efforts to improve care and predict outcomes for cancer patients.

Document 4 (Title: Monoclonal gammopathies: new approaches to clinical problems in diagnosis and prognosis.): When a patient presents with monoclonal gammopathy, a wide variety of clinical conditions must be considered. The importance of distinguishing accurately between patients with stable monoclonal gammopathies and those with overt multiple myeloma cannot be over-emphasised. The bone marrow examination with plasma cell labeling index, and newer techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography can improve diagnostic discrimination. In difficult cases, the detection of small numbers of circulating myeloma cells, the peripheral blood B-cell labeling index, and light chain isotype suppression may bring better diagnostic resolution. These tests may also be used to help assess disease activity. If the diagnosis is multiple myeloma, prediction of outcome assumes clinical importance. There are widely disparate survivals among patients with different clinical presentations. Standard clinical assays or a combination of these as in clinical staging do not provide sufficient prediction of outcome but are...
Document 5 (Title: A-B therapist characteristics vs. psychotherapy outcome: current status and prospects.): For more than 10 years much of the research into the effects of therapist characteristics on psychotherapy outcome has focused on the "A-B" variable. Various A-B scales have been used to predict differential process and outcome of A and B therapist with schizophrenics and neurotics, respectively. Although significant results frequently have been reported, findings of different studies have seemed to contradict each other, and most independent replication attempts have failed. Since reliable differences in outcomes achieved by various therapists-patient pairings have not been demonstrated, the confusing proliferation of theories concerning what A-B factors "make the difference" seems rather premature. A review of outcome and process studies in this area indicates that the phenomena under investigation are much more complex than is reflected in the previous A-B hypotheses. Therapist A-B scores do not predict every kind of success with every kind of patient generically labeled "schizophrenic" or "neurotic" in ev...
