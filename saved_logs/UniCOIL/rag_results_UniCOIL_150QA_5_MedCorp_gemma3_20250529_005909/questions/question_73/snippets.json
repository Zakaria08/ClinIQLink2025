        "title": "Monoclonal gammopathies: new approaches to clinical problems in diagnosis and prognosis.",
        "content": "When a patient presents with monoclonal gammopathy, a wide variety of clinical conditions must be considered. The importance of distinguishing accurately between patients with stable monoclonal gammopathies and those with overt multiple myeloma cannot be over-emphasised. The bone marrow examination with plasma cell labeling index, and newer techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography can improve diagnostic discrimination. In difficult cases, the detection of small numbers of circulating myeloma cells, the peripheral blood B-cell labeling index, and light chain isotype suppression may bring better diagnostic resolution. These tests may also be used to help assess disease activity. If the diagnosis is multiple myeloma, prediction of outcome assumes clinical importance. There are widely disparate survivals among patients with different clinical presentations. Standard clinical assays or a combination of these as in clinical staging do not provide sufficient prediction of outcome but are routinely available and therefore widely used. Independent predictive tests such as the plasma cell labeling index and beta 2-microglobulin improve prognostic accuracy. Ploidy analysis and immunophenotyping are additional variables that may assume more importance as the results of ongoing studies appear. Other promising approaches include detection of oncogene and multiple drug resistance gene expression. All such techniques will become more relevant as we apply more intensive treatment earlier in the disease course, particularly for the younger myeloma patients in whom the prognosis is poor.",

        "content": "For more than 10 years much of the research into the effects of therapist characteristics on psychotherapy outcome has focused on the \"A-B\" variable. Various A-B scales have been used to predict differential process and outcome of A and B therapist with schizophrenics and neurotics, respectively. Although significant results frequently have been reported, findings of different studies have seemed to contradict each other, and most independent replication attempts have failed. Since reliable differences in outcomes achieved by various therapists-patient pairings have not been demonstrated, the confusing proliferation of theories concerning what A-B factors \"make the difference\" seems rather premature. A review of outcome and process studies in this area indicates that the phenomena under investigation are much more complex than is reflected in the previous A-B hypotheses. Therapist A-B scores do not predict every kind of success with every kind of patient generically labeled \"schizophrenic\" or \"neurotic\" in every kind of treatment program. This conclusion need not arouse pessimism regarding the value of further A-Bresearch, but it clearly demands greater specificity in hypotheses and in research design. The failure of many recent studies to include true B type therapists has made their findings irrelevant to the A-B hypotheses, and has raised the question of whether the B therapist has become \"extinct.\" To provide further information about this phenomenon of the vanishing B therapist, the present authors conducted a survey of all Seattle psychiatrists in private practice. The survey yielded a total distribution of A-B scores which is not significatly skewed in either the A or B direction. However, most of the B's had graduated from residency training prior to 1960, while most of the A's had graduated in more recent years. These results suggest that, although current residency programs may not have enough B doctors for meaningful A-B research, such doctors do exist in the community.",
