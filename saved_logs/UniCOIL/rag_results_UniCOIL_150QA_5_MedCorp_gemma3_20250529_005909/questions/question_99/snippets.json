        "content": "There is marked variability in prevalence rates of low desire across cultures, ranging from 12.5% in Northern European men to 28% in Southeast Asian men ages 40—80 years. Just as there are higher rates of low desire among East Asian subgroups of women, men of East Asian ancestry also have higher rates of low desire. Guilt about sex may mediate this as- sociation between East Asian ethnicity and sexual desire in men. In contrast to the classification of sexual disorders in women, desire and arousal disorders have been retained as separate constructs in men. Despite some similarities in the experi- ence of desire across men and women, and the fact that desire ﬂuctuates over time and is dependent on contextual factors, men do report a significantly higher intensity and fre- quency of sexual desire compared with women.",

        "content": "To determine the interrelationships among neuroticism, general arousability, sexual desire, and sexual dysfunction in women, two studies were conducted. The first found a significant positive correlation between general arousability and neuroticism. The second found a curvilinear relationship between general arousability and sexual dysfunction, and a negative correlation between levels of sexual desire and sexual dysfunction. Implications for therapy with sexually dysfunctional women are discussed.",

This arousal within the body parts is due to conditioned physiological responses in the brain, which do not respond to the subject of the sexual intrusive thought but rather to the fact that a sexual thought is occurring at all and thus engage an automatic response (research indicates that the correlation between what the genitalia regard as \"sexually relevant\" and what the brain regards as \"sexually appealing\" only correlates 50% of the time in men and 10% of the time in women). This means that an arousal response does not necessarily indicate that the person desires what they are thinking about. However, rational thinking processes attempt to explain this reaction and OCD causes people to attribute false meaning and importance to these physiological reactions in an attempt to make sense of them. Sufferers can also experience heightened anxiety caused by \"forbidden\" images or simply by discussing the matter",

        "content": "Four different studies of sexual problems and sexual dysfunction in patients with hypothalamo-pituitary disorders have been undertaken and data about the sex life of the patients have been correlated with diagnosis, tumour extension and pathology, endocrine insufficiency and pituitary hormone hypersecretion. In the first study 48 out of 53 (76.2%) adult males with pituitary tumours reported decreased or absent sexual desire. The corresponding figure in the second study was 29 out of 37 (78.4%) among adult males with pituitary tumours and hyperprolactinaemia. Twenty (31.7%) and 18 (48.6%) patients, respectively, reported decreased sexual desire as the first symptom of their tumour. A highly significant correlation between a decrease in serum testosterone and a decrease in sexual desire was found. Some males with normal serum testosterone but hyperprolactinaemia also reported decreased sexual desire. In the third study, 109 females (aged 20-60) with morphologically verified hypothalamo-pituitary disorders, 68 (62.4%) had noticed a decrease in sexual desire. This problem was registered for 53 (84.1%) out of the 63 women in this group who had hyperprolactinaemia but only in 15 (32.6%) out of the 46 women with normal serum prolactin (p less than 0.001). In the last study 48 women with well-defined hypothalamo-pituitary disorders underwent a comprehensive interview about sexual function and sexual appreciation. Thirty-eight (79.2%) of the women had developed a lack of or a considerable decrease in sexual desire. Problems with lubrication or orgasms were reported by 31 (64.6%) and 33 (68.7%) of the women, respectively. Preservation of normal menstrual pattern, age, and intrasellar tumour growth was correlated to normal sexual desire and function.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
