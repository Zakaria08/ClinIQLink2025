        "content": "The healing corneal wounds consist of newly abutting corneal stroma, fibroblastic cells, and irregular fibrous connective tissue. Closer to the wound surface lies the epithelial plug, a bed of the cells that form the normal corneal epithelium which have fallen into the wound. Often this plug is three to four times as deep as the normal corneal epithelium layer. As the cells migrate from the depth of the plug up to the surface, some die before reaching it, forming breaches in the otherwise healthy epithelial layer. This, consequently, leaves the cornea more susceptible to infections. The risk is estimated to be between 0.25% and 0.7% Healing of the RK incisions is very slow and unpredictable, often incomplete even years after surgery. Similarly, infection of these chronic wounds can also occur years after surgery, with 53% of ocular infections being late in onset. The pathogen most commonly involved in such infections is the highly virulent bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa.",

        "title": "Effect of low level laser therapy on wound healing after palatal surgery in beagle dogs.",
        "content": "The effect of low level laser therapy on wound healing and wound contraction after palatal surgery in Beagle dogs of 12 weeks of age was investigated. A total of 30 Beagle dogs was used and assigned to a control group (Group C; n = 6) and two experimental groups (Group L; n = 12 and group LL; n = 12). In both experimental groups, Von Langenbeck's palatal repair was simulated. Then in the LL group the denuded bony areas were treated with low level laser therapy using a continuous Ga-As-A1 laser beam (830 nm) and energy output set at 30 mW. Per treatment a dosage of 1 J/cm2 wound surface area was used. Therapy was carried out three times a week with a total of ten treatments. Wound healing was observed clinically until wound healing was completed at 4 weeks p.o. and wound areas were measured at regular intervals on standardized intra-oral photographs. Wound contraction was measured as the increments of the distances between tattoo points on the opposite wound margins. No significant differences were found in the quality and rate of wound healing between the two experimental groups. The same held true for the increments of the distances between opposite tattoo points. It was concluded that macroscopically low level laser therapy under conditions used in this study did not have an influence on wound closure or wound contraction.",

        "content": "We developed a new delivery system for corneal ablation with the 193 nm argon-fluoride excimer laser. The laser was used to make linear incisions in the rabbit cornea, and wound healing of the incisions was compared with the healing of incisions made with metal and diamond blades. The morphology of incisions made with excimer laser radiation (193 nm) was compared with the morphology of incisions produced by diamond and metal blades, and the corneal wound was examined by light and electron microscopy. The surface of the cornea at the site of the laser wound was smooth; the laser wound was wider than the blade wounds immediately after surgery. Two weeks after surgery, all wounds had healed equally. One month after surgery, there were fewer fibroblastic keratocytes in the laser wound, and the epithelial layer at the wound site was thinner than in the case of the blade wounds. These results suggest that wound healing of laser incisions is more rapid than healing of wounds created with metal or diamond blades.",
