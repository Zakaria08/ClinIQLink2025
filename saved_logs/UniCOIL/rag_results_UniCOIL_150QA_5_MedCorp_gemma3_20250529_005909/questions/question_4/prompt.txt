Document 1 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Unburned cured tobacco used orally contains nicotine, carcinogens, and other toxicants capable of causing gum disease, oral and pancreatic cancers, and an increase in the risk of heart disease. When tobacco is burned, the resultant smoke contains, in addition to nicotine, more than 7000 other compounds that result from volatilization, pyrolysis, and pyrosynthesis of tobacco and various chemical additives used in making different tobacco products. The smoke is composed of a fine aerosol and a vapor phase; aerosolized particles are of a size range that results in deposition in the airways and alveolar surfaces of the lungs.

Document 3 (Title: Repair of tetralogy of Fallot in infancy. Effect of pulmonary artery size on outcome.): The possible influence of small pulmonary artery size on the results following complete repair of tetralogy of Fallot has not been investigated in patients less than 1 year of age. We, therefore, reviewed our recent experience with infant repair to assess this. Between January 87 and October 90, repair was performed in 58 infants less than 1 year old (median, 6 months) with tetralogy of Fallot and pulmonary stenosis (n = 53) or pulmonary atresia without important aortopulmonary collaterals (n = 5). The McGoon ratio (diameter of the right pulmonary artery at the prebranching point plus that of the left divided by the diameter of the aorta at the diaphragm) by cineangiography (n = 48) was between 1.2 and 1.5 in 15 patients, 1.6 and 2.0 in 20, and greater than 2.0 in 13. Transannular patching was performed in 19 of the patients with pulmonary stenosis (36%). Muscle resection was avoided in 29 infants and was minimal in the remaining 29. A weak correlation, with considerable scatter, was found between the McGoon ...

Question: A pulmonary autopsy specimen from a 58-year-old woman who died of acute hypoxic respiratory failure was examined. She had recently undergone surgery for a fractured femur 3 months ago. Initial hospital course was uncomplicated, and she was discharged to a rehab facility in good health. Shortly after discharge home from rehab, she developed sudden shortness of breath and had cardiac arrest. Resuscitation was unsuccessful. On histological examination of lung tissue, fibrous connective tissue around the lumen of the pulmonary artery is observed. Which of the following is the most likely pathogenesis for the present findings?
Options:
A. Thromboembolism
B. Pulmonary ischemia
C. Pulmonary hypertension
D. Pulmonary passive congestion
