The primary care provider and nurse practitioner should be aware that there are phases of the heart (i.e., hibernating) which may not always require coronary artery bypass surgery. In some cases, the heart muscle may not be viable, and hence a coronary artery bypass is a futile procedure. Thus, it is important to distinguish between stunned, hibernating, and scar tissue before undertaking any type of revascularization procedure.",

        "content": "A coronary artery may be unsuitable for bypass grafting if it is small (< 1 mm or < 1.5 mm), heavily calcified, or located within the heart muscle rather than on the surface. A single obstruction of the left main coronary artery is associated with a higher risk for a cardiac death and usually receives a double bypass. The surgeon reviews the coronary angiogram prior to surgery and identifies the number of obstructions, the percent obstruction of each, and the suitability of the arteries beyond the as targets. The presumed number of bypass grafts needed as well as the location for graft attachment is determined in a preliminary fashion prior to surgery, but the final decision as to number and location is made during surgery by direct examination of the heart.",

        "title": "Autologous blood donations prior to elective cardiac surgery. Safety and effect on subsequent blood use.",
        "content": "Blood transfusions are frequently necessary for patients having open heart surgery. Although autologous blood is free of such risks as transfusion-transmitted diseases, the safety and effectiveness of autologous donations by cardiac patients are debated. We analyzed the records of 291 consecutive patients undergoing elective open heart surgery. One hundred seven (36.8%) donated between 1 and 6 U of autologous blood (mean, 3.0 +/- 1.5 U) before undergoing surgery. First-time elective coronary artery bypass surgery was the most common indication for autologous donation (90.6% of autologous donors). Problems following donations were infrequent (2 of 326 donations) and without long-term consequences. Among patients having coronary artery bypass surgery who donated autologous blood, 27% required homologous blood transfusions as compared with 82% of other patients undergoing the same procedure. We conclude that autologous blood donations are safe for patients with cardiac disease and effective in significantly reducing homologous blood needs in patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass surgery.",

        "content": "To assess the haemodynamic effects of aorto-coronary saphenous vein bypass grafting, pre- and post-angiographic left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) and ejection fraction (EF) were measured before and in average 14 months after surgery in 80 patients. Symptomatic improvement occurred in 91% (73 of 80). In 43 patients with patent graft(s), pre-angiographic LVEDP and EF were unchanged (p always greater than 0.05), while postangiographic LVEDP was significantly reduced. Unchanged pre- and postangiographic LVEDP and EF were observed in 28 patients with double or triple grafts, with at least one graft patent and the other(s) occluded. Unchanged pre- and postangiographic LVEDP and reduced EF were observed in 9 patients with occluded single, double or triple grafts. We conclude that successful aorto-coronary saphenous vein bypass surgery in general does not improve resting left ventricular performance, but that the beneficial effect on left ventricular function can be demonstrated after a stress test such as ventriculography. A single graft to the left anterior descending artery seems to be of particular importance in this connection. On the other hand, deterioration was evident after unsuccessful surgery, particularly in patients with occlusions of 2 or 3 grafts. Digitalis therapy after operation or electrocardiographic indices of postoperative myocardial infarction apparently did not influence left ventricular performance.",
