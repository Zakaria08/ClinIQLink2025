        "title": "Can road traffic law enforcement permanently reduce the number of accidents?",
        "content": "In this paper it is argued that conventional analyses of road user adaptation to traffic law enforcement, based on parametric rational-choice theory, are flawed. Such analyses only consider road-user actions as a response to enforcement level and penalty size and do not simultaneously consider enforcement as a response to road-user behaviour. If each party is considered a rational agent who adapts to the other's behaviour, the proper way to analyze the outcomes is by the way of game theory. A game-theoretic model is presented and the main implications are: (i) most attempts at enforcing road traffic legislation will not have any lasting effects, either on road-user behaviour or on accidents; (ii) imposing stricter penalties (in the form of higher fines or longer prison sentences) will not affect road-user behaviour; (iii) imposing stricter penalties will reduce the level of enforcement; (iv) implementing automatic traffic surveillance techniques and/or allocating enforcement resources according to a chance mechanism, and not according to police estimates of violation probability, can make enforcement effects last, but both alternatives are difficult to implement. Relevant empirical studies are reviewed, and they seem to support the conclusions arrived at by the game-theoretic model.",

After every major event, first responder agencies modify their response, training, and capabilities. For example, following events such as the Aurora theater shooting in Colorado and the Pulse nightclub shooting in Florida, many law enforcement officers throughout the country are being trained in tactical, emergency, and casualty-care interventions. Interventions include tourniquet application, hemostatic gauze, nasopharyngeal airways, and the application of pressure dressings. However, law enforcement is instructed to neutralize the threat before rendering any aid. At no time should rapid movement to the threat or exercising good tactics be jeopardized or hindered due to providing medical assistance to casualties. Law enforcement officers are taught to come back and address casualties during warm zone operations when there is no additional credible intelligence of further threats. However, the building or area may not have been completely cleared. The term cleared has been used interchangeably with other law enforcement terms such as search, check, safe, and others. When a room, building, or area has been cleared, every possible area where a person could be hiding or concealed is checked and verified for no hidden individuals. Once the area has been cleared, the room, building, or area is designated a cold zone. With the integration of rescue task force principals, more non-law enforcement EMS providers are being integrated into tactical teams that rapidly enter warm zones before the areas have been completely cleared.
