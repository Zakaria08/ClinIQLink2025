        "content": "The relationships between attitudes toward oneself (self-concept) and nutrition-related behavior were examined for 153 single women aged 18 to 35 years. Nutrition-related behaviors were assessed with 3-day food records that were analyzed for nutrient composition and eating patterns (Basic Four Food Group scores, number of meals per day, and percent of energy from meals and snacks). Attitudes toward self, knowledge and attitudes about nutrition, and general health practices were assessed with a written questionnaire that incorporated several existing scales. Because of potential overlap among the three self-concept scales, as well as nutrition-attitude and health-practice items, responses were factor analyzed, yielding 14 factors. These factors were then compared with nutrient intake and eating patterns. Scores for the seemingly desirable factors of the \"Super Person\" or \"Do Your Own Thing\" were negatively correlated with intake of several nutrients; scores on the self-perception of a \"Traditional\" orientation to life were positively related to calcium intake and meal patterns. The \"Nutrition Is Important\" and \"Nutrition Knowledge\" factors were also positively related to desirable eating patterns and nutrient intakes. We conclude that several self-concept variables, as well as nutrition attitudes and knowledge, can potentially influence nutrient intakes and eating patterns in young women.",
