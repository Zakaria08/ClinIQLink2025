        "content": "Studies were carried out with a new, concentrated perfluorochemical emulsion (PFCE) of the perfluorochemical F44E (48% V/V). When given at 4, 1.6, or 1 g/kg in undiluted injection volumes iv 1 hr prior to a range of single doses of radiation with inspired carbogen dose modifying factors (DMF's) based on tumor growth delay (TGD) in the Lewis lung tumor of 2.5, 1.7, and 1.5, respectively, were produced. When the PFC dose was administered in a volume of 0.2 ml, the dose modifying factors produced by 4 g/kg (0.1 ml undiluted) did not change significantly (2.6), but the dose modifying factors produced by 1.6 g/kg (0.04 ml undiluted) and by 1.0 g/kg (0.025 ml undiluted) increased significantly to 2.0 and 1.8 (p less than 0.05), respectively. Using the tumor excision assay at 24 hr post treatment in the FSaIIC fibrosarcoma, administration of 6, 4, or 2 g/kg in 0.2 ml injections plus carbogen breathing 1 hr prior to and during treatment resulted in dose modifying factors of 1.5, 1.6, and 1.3, respectively. In a fractionated radiation protocol in the Lewis lung tumor using four daily fractions, a dose of 4 g/kg of PFC on days 1 and 3 proved superior to a dose of 2 g/kg daily (dose modifying factors 2.4 vs. 1.9, p less than 0.05). When a fractionated radiation regimen of 3 Gy daily X 5 and carbogen was used, PFC doses of 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 g/kg administered undiluted produced increasing tumor growth delays with increasing dose of PFCE and increasing frequency of administration. In addition, dilutions to 0.2 ml proved significantly more effective. In a 2-week fractionated radiation protocol using 2, 3, or 4 Gy daily X 5 weekly, PFCE given in 0.2 ml volume plus carbogen breathing daily at 4, 1.6, or 1 g/kg produced dose modifying factors of 2.0, 1.9, and 1.6, respectively. Finally, when used in a day 1, 3, and 5 radiation regimen for 3 weeks at 2, 3, or 4 Gy/fraction, 4 g/kg of PFCE given in a volume of 0.2 ml plus carbogen breathing produced a superior dose modifying factor (1.6) as compared with 1.6 or 1.0 g/kg (dose modifying factors 1.4 and 1.3, respectively). These results indicate that PFCE plus carbogen breathing effectively enhances the antitumor effects of both single dose and fractionated radiation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

Protein phosphatase (PP) 1 and 2A activities were measured in soluble and particulate fractions of rat lung homogenates, obtained from 18- to 22-day gestation fetal rats, from neonates, and from adults. PP 1 activity in the particulate fraction increased 7-fold from 15 +/- 2 to 102 +/- 12 (mean +/- SD) U/g lung between 18 and 22 days gestation, increased a further 1.5-fold to 152 +/- 18 U/g in newborns, with no further increase in adults. PP 2A activity in the particulate fraction increased 3-fold from 10 +/- 2 to 32 +/- 5 U/g between 21 and 22 days gestation and did not change postnatally. PP 1 activity in the soluble fraction increased 7.8-fold from 4 +/- 2 to 31 +/- 4 U/g lung between 18 and 22 days gestation, increased a further 1.8-fold in newborns to 54 +/- 8 U/g lung and increased 1.5-fold to 81 +/- 6 U/g lung in adults.

The conduction velocity was measured on the day following each exposure period, and again, three and six months after the last day of exposure. The majority of exposed rats showed a reduction in conduction velocity on the day after exposure: the extent of this reduction was dependent on the CS2 concentration and the duration of exposure.

Increased exposure to CS2 (3,6 or 9 months at 1.6 mg/l; 6 or 12 months at 0.9 mg/l CS2 in air) caused a reduction in velocity which was only partially reversible.",
