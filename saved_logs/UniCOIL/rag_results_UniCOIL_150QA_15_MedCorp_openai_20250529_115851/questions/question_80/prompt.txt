Document 1 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): intervention may prove necessary in patients receiving anticoagulation therapy. Increasing experience suggests that surgical treatment can be undertaken without full reversal of the anticoagulant, depending on the procedure being performed.62 When the aPTT is less than 1.3 times control in a heparinized patient, or when the INR is less than 1.5 in a patient on warfarin, reversal of anticoagulation therapy may not be necessary. How-ever, meticulous surgical technique is mandatory, and the patient must be observed closely throughout the postoperative period.Certain surgical procedures should not be performed in concert with anticoagulation. In particular, cases where even minor bleeding can cause great morbidity, such as the central nervous system and the eye, surgery should be avoided. Emer-gency operations are occasionally necessary in patients who have been heparinized. The first step in these patients is to dis-continue heparin. For more rapid reversal, protamine sulfate is
Document 2 (Title: Operation Smile): Operation Smile offers education in safe surgical conditions in Ethiopia and Rwanda, where they have offered surgical training rotations for general surgeons to learn reconstructive plastic surgery techniques — since 2012 in Ethiopia and since 2015 in Rwanda. The two-week training courses for Ethiopian surgeons, anesthesiologists and nurses take place at JUSH (Jimma University Specialized Hospital), the only hospital serving the 15 million-plus people living in Ethiopia’s southwestern region. The rotations cover cleft surgery as well as techniques to better heal burn, trauma and surgical wounds, representing the bulk of the hospital’s plastic surgery cases.
Document 3 (Title: Mucocele and Ranula -- Consultations): Before the surgical excision of mucoceles or ranulas, it is mandatory to consult with a radiologist to help in defining the boundaries and extension of the lesion. This would prove to be of paramount significance for the surgeon in terms of a better outcome of the surgery by avoiding severe complications. Consultation with the anesthesiologist becomes necessary when the ranula is large enough to cause respiratory compromise.
Document 4 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): surgeryLaparoscopic surgerySeamless surgeryProgress in surgeryfor all surgeons. This technology has the advantage of enabling objective measurement of psychomotor skills, which can be used to determine progress in skill acquisition and, ultimately, techni-cal competency.101 Several of these devices have been validated as a means of measuring proficiency in skill performance. More importantly, training on virtual reality platforms has proven to translate to improved operative performance in randomized tri-als.102,103 Currently, surgical skills labs are mandatory for Resi-dency Review Committee credentialing. Successful completion of the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS) technical and cognitive examination became a mandatory prerequisite for the American Board of Surgery (ABS) qualification examination in general surgery in 2010. The Fundamentals of Endoscopic Surgery (FES) became a prerequisite to ABS qualification in 2015. In the future, institutions may require simulator
Document 5 (Title: Rotator cuff): Surgery may be recommended for patients with an acute, traumatic rotator cuff tear resulting in substantial weakness. Surgery can be performed open or arthroscopically, although the arthroscopic approach has become much more popular. If a surgical option is selected, the rehabilitation of the rotator cuff is necessary in order to regain maximum strength and range of motion within the shoulder joint. Physical therapy progresses through four stages, increasing movement throughout each phase. The tempo and intensity of the stages are solely reliant on the extent of the injury and the patient's activity necessities. The first stage requires immobilization of the shoulder joint. The shoulder that is injured is placed in a sling and shoulder flexion or abduction of the arm is avoided for 4 to 6 weeks after surgery (Brewster, 1993). Avoiding movement of the shoulder joint allows the torn tendon to fully heal. Once the tendon is entirely recovered, passive exercises can be implemented.
