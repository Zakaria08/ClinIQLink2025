In the first study 48 out of 53 (76.2%) adult males with pituitary tumours reported decreased or absent sexual desire. The corresponding figure in the second study was 29 out of 37 (78.4%) among adult males with pituitary tumours and hyperprolactinaemia. Twenty (31.7%) and 18 (48.6%) patients, respectively, reported decreased sexual desire as the first symptom of their tumour. A highly significant correlation between a decrease in serum testosterone and a decrease in sexual desire was found. Some males with normal serum testosterone but hyperprolactinaemia also reported decreased sexual desire. In the third study, 109 females (aged 20-60) with morphologically verified hypothalamo-pituitary disorders, 68 (62.4%) had noticed a decrease in sexual desire. This problem was registered for 53 (84.1%) out of the 63 women in this group who had hyperprolactinaemia but only in 15 (32.6%) out of the 46 women with normal serum prolactin (p less than 0.001). In the last study 48 women with well-defined hypothalamo-pituitary disorders underwent a comprehensive interview about sexual function and sexual appreciation. Thirty-eight (79.2%) of the women had developed a lack of or a considerable decrease in sexual desire. Problems with lubrication or orgasms were reported by 31 (64.6%) and 33 (68.7%) of the women, respectively. Preservation of normal menstrual pattern, age, and intrasellar tumour growth was correlated to normal sexual desire and function.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
