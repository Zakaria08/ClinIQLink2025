Subjects (n = 5) underwent blood sampling at 10-min intervals for 6 h before and on days 2, 5, and 8 of glucocorticoid treatment, and for 24 h (n = 6) to examine pulsatile LH and GH release before and during dexamethasone administration (1.5 mg orally twice daily for 1 week). In the time-course study, we found significant decreases on day 8 in serum concentrations of estradiol (from 144 +/- 18 to 99 +/- 18 pmol/L), free testosterone (from 105 +/- 10 to 87 +/- 10 pmol/L), and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (from 6.0 +/- 1.6 to 1.7 +/- 0.3 mumol/L; P less than 0.05). Mean serum LH concentrations did not change (baseline, 5.3 +/- 1.2 IU/L; glucocorticoid, 4.2 +/- 0.61 IU/L). The mean plasma somatomedin-C concentration rose from 0.74 +/- 0.08 to 2.0 +/- 0.35 U/mL (P less than 0.05), and the mean serum GH concentration increased from 1.2 +/- 0.90 micrograms/L (basal) to 4.2 +/- 1.5 micrograms/L (day 8 of dexamethasone; P less than 0.01). Deconvolution analysis of 24-h serum GH and LH concentration profiles revealed that the half-life of endogenous GH and the duration and amplitude (maximal rate of secretion) of computer-resolved GH secretory bursts were not influenced significantly by dexamethasone. The mass of GH secreted per burst rose 1.6-fold. Glucocorticoid treatment also increased detectable GH secretory burst frequency from 12 +/- 1.6 to 18 +/- 1.6 episodes/24 h, decreased the GH interburst interval from 127 +/- 23 to 79 +/- 5 min, and increased the daily GH secretion rate from 41 +/- 11 to 101 +/- 11 micrograms/L.day. These effects on the somatotropic axis were specific, since the half-life of LH; LH secretory burst frequency, amplitude, mass, and duration; and the total daily LH production rate (and LH secretion in response to exogenous GnRH) were not altered by dexamethasone administration. We conclude that short term moderate glucocorticoid excess augments pulsatile GH secretion without influencing the episodic release of LH in normal men.",

        "content": "The incidence of cancer was studied in a population-based cohort of 9,353 individuals (8,340 men and 1,013 women) with a discharge diagnosis of alcoholism in 1965-83, followed up for 19 years (mean 7.7). After exclusion of cancers in the first year of follow-up, 491 cancers were observed cf 343.2 expected through 1984 (standardized incidence ratio [SIR] = 1.4, 95 percent confidence interval [CI] = 1.3-1.6). A similar excess risk of cancer was seen among men (SIR = 1.4, CI = 1.3-1.6) and among women (SIR = 1.5, CI = 1.1-2.0). We observed the established associations with cancers of the oral cavity and pharynx (SIR = 4.1, CI = 2.9-5.7), esophagus (SIR = 6.8, CI = 4.5-9.9), larynx (SIR = 3.3, CI = 1.7-6.0), and lung (SIR = 2.1, CI = 1.7-2.6), although confounding by smoking likely increased these risk estimates. While there was evidence of increased risk for pancreatic cancer (SIR = 1.5, CI = 0.9-2.3), alcoholism did not elevate the incidence of cancer of the stomach (SIR = 0.9, CI = 6-1.4), large bowel (SIR = 1.1, CI = 0.8-1.5), prostate (SIR = 1.0, CI = 0.8-1.3), urinary bladder (SIR = 1.0, CI = 0.6-1.5), or of malignant melanoma (SIR = 0.9, CI = 0.3-1.9). Among women, the number of breast cancers observed was close to expected (SIR = 1.2, CI = 0.6-2.2), although a significant excess number of cervical cancers occurred (SIR = 4.2, CI = 1.5-9.1).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

The conduction velocity was measured on the day following each exposure period, and again, three and six months after the last day of exposure. The majority of exposed rats showed a reduction in conduction velocity on the day after exposure: the extent of this reduction was dependent on the CS2 concentration and the duration of exposure.
