Document 1 (Title: Commonwealth Fund): Current leadership President The Commonwealth Fund's president is David Blumenthal, M.D. Blumenthal used to be the Samuel O. Thier Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School and Chief Health Information and Innovation Officer at Partners Healthcare System in Boston. From 2009 to 2011, Blumenthal served as the U.S. National Coordinator for Health Information Technology. Previously, he was a practicing primary care physician, director of the Institute for Health Policy, and professor of medicine and health policy at Massachusetts General Hospital/Partners Healthcare System and Harvard Medical School. He is a member of the Institute of Medicine and a former board member and national correspondent for the New England Journal of Medicine.
Document 2 (Title: Changing patient management: what influences the practicing pediatrician?): To explore some determinants of physicians' decisions to change practice habits, we posed three questions: To what extent are some particular innovations diffused among office-based primary care physicians? What characterizes the physicians who have adopted these innovations? And, what caused them to change their behavior and adopt the innovations? Three "markers," recent innovation in medical practice, were chosen using an expert consensus technique. A telephone survey of 200 office-based pediatricians was conducted, and the physicians were asked whether or not they used the following three innovations in medical practice: continuous rather than intermittent phenobarbital for the prevention of febrile seizures, glycosylated hemoglobin measurement in the management of diabetes, and slow release theophylline in the management of asthma. The questionnaire was completed by 156 pediatricians. Of the 110 pediatricians who cared for diabetics, 73% used glycosylated hemoglobin measurement; of the 145 who saw patient...
Document 3 (Title: Health Information Technology -- Clinical Significance): Health Information Technology plays a role in improving health outcomes, quality of care, and the health care experience of patients, for example: Allows access up-to-date evidence-based clinical guidelines and resources Improves quality of care and patient safety Assists patients in health maintenance Coordinates care with multiple providers Assists in sharing of clinical information Relieves providers of paper-based referral process that burden practices and organizations.
Document 4 (Title: Time to adoption of an innovation by dentists in private practice: sealant utilization.): Dentists can be divided into five adoption categories based upon their time of adoption of pit and fissure sealants: innovators, early adopters, early majority, late majority, and laggards. The differences among dentists in the five adoption categories were examined for four classes of variables: practice characteristics, dentist characteristics, communication of information, and practice environment. Questionnaires were mailed in September 1984 to a random sample (N = 521) of Washington State dentists in general practices. A total of 376 completed questionnaires were returned, for a response rate of 72 percent. Adoption of sealants proceeded as follows: 5 percent of dentists through 1973, 24 percent through 1979, 50 percent through 1982, and 75 percent through 1984. Adoption category was related to percent of assistants who were certified, delegation to assistants and hygienists, magnitude of the fees charged by the practice, number of staff meetings per month, the dentist having been an officer in a dental ...
Document 5 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): time but not lymph node yield. However, evidence that a lab-based technical and cognitive skills test predicts observed operative technical skill in practicing surgeons is promising and warrants investigative follow-up.At the present time, the American Board of Surgery’s requirements for Maintenance of Certification (MOC) do not specifically include any certification of technical skills that might use surgical simulation.188 Nonetheless, simulation training and testing can be made available to surgeons in practice to provide an avenue for specific training. Although most investigations of VR use for laparoscopy have examined basic skills acquisition in the lab setting far in advance of any measured impact in the clinical OR, a recent innovative study of the use of a VR simulator for “warm-up” practice immediately before a procedure showed that this improved OR performance.189 As new surgical procedures and technologies are introduced to clinical practice, simulation training solutions
