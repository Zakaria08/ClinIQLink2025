Document 1 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Service Delivery Reforms to Make Health Systems People-Centered Health systems have often been organized around the needs of those who provide health care services, such as clinicians and policymakers. The result is a centralization of services or the provision of vertical programs that target single diseases. The principles of primary health Extend to uninsured Depth: which benefits Height: what proportion of the costs is covered? Public expenditure on health are covered? Breadth: who is insured? FIGURE 13e-7 Three ways of moving toward universal coverage. care, including the development of primary care, reorient care around 13e-5 the needs of the people to whom services cater. This “people-centered” approach aims to provide health care that is both more effective and appropriate.
Document 2 (Title: Managed Care -- Definition/Introduction): Over time, some less traditional HMOs emerged where the PCP does not serve as the gatekeeper, and the patient may self-referral to a specialist. However, for the service to be covered and paid for by the managed care plan, the patient is still limited to only receiving care and service from network providers. HMOs' utilization and quality management programs collect much data on the care and services authorized and provided by the PCP and other providers. This data is communicated to the PCP and other network providers regularly as the financial incentives revolve around compliance with the managed care plan’s utilization and quality programs’ targets. For the patients, the financial incentive is that they receive insurance coverage only for services that occur within the network.
Document 3 (Title: Disease management (health)): By April 2008, CMS had spent $360 million on the project. The individual programs ended between December 2006 and August 2008. The results of the program were published in The New England Journal of Medicine in November 2011. Comparing the 163,107 patients randomized to the intervention group with the 79,310 patients randomized to the control group, the researchers found that "disease-management programs did not reduce hospital admissions or emergency room visits, as compared with usual care." Furthermore, there was "no demonstrable savings in Medicare expenditures," with the net fees for disease management ranging from 3.8% to 10.9% per patient per month. The researchers suggested that the findings might be explained by the severity of chronic disease among the patients studied, delays in patients' receiving disease management after hospitalizations, and lack of integration between health coaches and the patients' primary care providers.
Document 4 (Title: Primary health services in Ecuador: comparative costs, quality, and equity of care in Ministry of Health and rural social security facilities.): This study of costs, quality and financial equity of primary health services in Ecuador, based on 1985 data, examines three assumptions, common in international health, concerning Ministry of Health (MOH) and Social Security (SS) programs. The assumptions are that MOH services are less costly than SS services, that they are of lower quality than SS services, and that MOH programs are more equitable in terms of the distribution of funds available for PHC among different population groups. Full costs of a range of primary health services were estimated by standard accounting techniques for 15 typical health care establishments, 8 operated by the MOH and 7 by the rural SS program (RSSP), serving rural and peri-urban populations in the two major geographical regions of Ecuador. Consistent with the conventional premise, MOH average costs were much lower than RSSP costs for several important types of services, especially those provided by physicians. Little difference was found for dental care. The lower MOH physic...
Document 5 (Title: Financing geriatric programs in community health centers.): There are approximately 600 Community and Migrant Health Centers (C/MHCs) providing preventive and primary health care services principally to medically underserved rural and urban areas across the United States. The need to develop geriatric programs within C/MHCs is clear. Less clear is how and under what circumstances a comprehensive geriatric program can be adequately financed. The Health Resources and Services Administration of the Public Health Service contracted with La Jolla Management Corporation and Duke University Center on Aging to identify successful techniques for obtaining funding by examining 10 "good practice" C/MHC geriatric programs. The results from this study indicated that effective techniques included using a variety of funding sources, maintaining accurate cost-per-user information, developing a marketing strategy and user incentives, collaborating with the area agency on aging and other community organizations, and developing special services for the elderly. Developing cost-per-user ...
