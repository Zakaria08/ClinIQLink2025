        "content": "Morphological and physiological effects of kainic acid (KA) lesions in rat ventral lateral geniculate nucleus (LGV) were studied 1.5 and 6 h after KA injection. Morphological changes were examined mainly by electron micrographs. At 1.5 h after KA injection dendrites were dilated and some vacuolations occurred in both dendrites and perikarya including geniculotectal relay neurons while axons were completely intact and cell organelles almost remained intact. Six h after KA injection dendrites and cell bodies were massively dilated with degeneration of cell organelles accompanied by sparse cytoplasm and deformed chromatin in the nucleus. However, almost all presynaptic axons, mainly retinogeniculate fibers, still remained intact. The electron micrographs demonstrate that destruction occurred first in dendrites, next in cell bodies and finally axons were likely to be affected. These morphological changes induced by KA are compatible with physiological effects which were assessed by the field response of the superior colliculus (SC) evoked by stimulation of the optic chiasm. During 1.5-2 h after KA injection all components of the SC response, the presynaptic and postsynaptic negative-positive waves were enhanced. The enhancement of the SC response may be correlated with morphological changes in terms of excitatory action of KA resulting in facilitation of geniculotectal transmission. Six h after KA injection postsynaptic negative-positive waves gradually declined in amplitude while the presynaptic wave returned to control level. The late suppression of postsynaptic components of the SC response may be attributable to a marked loss of geniculotectal transmission resulting from destruction of geniculotectal relay neurons by KA.",

Although prolonged treatment of cats for urologic syndromes with MB-containing antiseptics causes Heinz body (HB) hemolytic anemia, there is no evidence to suggest that single or repeated therapeutic doses of MB cause hemolytic anemia. We investigated the efficacy and safety of MB in reversing nitrite-induced MTHB in cats. Forty random-bred adult cats (20 males and 20 females) were divided as follows: Group 1, 1.5 mL saline/kg bw iv (control); Group 2, 1 dose of 1.5 mg MB/kg bw iv; Group 3, 2 doses of 1.5 mg MB/kg bw iv 4 h apart; Group 4 1 dose of 1.5 mg sodium nitrite/kg bw iv; Group 5, 1 dose of 1.5 mg sodium nitrite/kg bw iv followed by 1 dose of 1.5 mg MB/kg bw iv 1 h later; and Group 6, 1.5 mg sodium nitrite/kg bw iv followed in 2 h by 2 doses of 1.5 mg MB/kg iv 4 h apart. One iv dose of MB sufficiently and rapidly reversed MTHB in the cats without increasing circulating HB-containing red blood cells. Giving 2 iv doses of MB without or after sodium nitrite significantly increased the frequency of circulating HB-containing red blood cells. Pre-exposure to sodium nitrite potentiated the HB-inducing effect of 2 doses of MB. Hemolytic anemia was not observed or demonstrated in any of the cats groups.",

It is necessary to avoid a serum calcium-phosphorus product >50 to reduce the risk of heterotopic calcification. Hypocalcemia, if present, should be corrected before administering IV phosphate. Less severe hypophosphatemia, in the range of 0.5–0.8 mmol/L (1.5–2.5 mg/dL), usually can be treated with oral phosphate in divided doses of 750–2000 mg/d as elemental phosphorus; higher doses can cause bloating and diarrhea.",

Most prominent is a variant of the transcription factor 7–like 2 gene that has been associated with type 2 DM in several populations and with IGT in one population at high risk for diabetes. Genetic polymorphisms associated with type 2 DM have also been found in the genes encoding the peroxisome proliferator– activated receptor γ, inward rectifying potassium channel, zinc transporter, IRS, and calpain 10. The mechanisms by which these genetic loci increase the susceptibility to type 2 DM are not clear, but most are predicted to alter islet function or development or insulin secretion. Although the genetic susceptibility to type 2 DM is under active investigation (it is estimated that <10% of genetic risk is determined by loci identified thus far), it is currently not possible to use a",

Most remarkable, the 1989 look was very short lived: with the 1990 model year yet another facelift appeared. Another notable fact was the renaming of the four-door Pony Sedan to Excel in Europe.

        "content": "To characterize passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) in the mouse ear, reactions caused by non-heated and heated antiserum were compared to those caused by monoclonal immunoglobulin E antibody (mc-IgE) and monoclonal immunoglobulin G1 antibody (mc-IgG1). Heat treatment at 56 degrees C did not alter the activity of antiserum or mc-IgG1 to elicit the 1.5-h PCA. The 1.5-h PCA mediated by mc-IgE and 48-h PCA's mediated by both antiserum and mc-IgE were abrogated almost completely by heating at 56 degrees C for 2 h. The 48-h PCA was not elicited by mc-IgG1. The sensitized state persisted at least for 7 d when mice were sensitized with non-heated antiserum or mc-IgE. In contrast, the sensitized state disappeared rapidly in cases of heated antiserum and mc-IgG1. In 48-h PCA's mediated by antiserum and mc-IgE, extravasated dye in the ear was detected 5 min after challenge and the reaction was terminated in 15 min. In contrast, in the 1.5-h PCA mediated by heated antiserum, the accumulation of dye in the ear was delayed slightly when compared to the 48-h PCA. In mc-IgG1-mediated 1.5-h PCA, the delay was significant. Both 1.5-h PCA's mediated by heated antiserum and mc-IgG1, and the 48-h PCA's mediated by antiserum and mc-IgE were not observed in WBB6 F1-W/Wv mice, which lack mast cells. All these PCA's were inhibited equally by tranilast, an inhibitor of mediator release from mast cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
