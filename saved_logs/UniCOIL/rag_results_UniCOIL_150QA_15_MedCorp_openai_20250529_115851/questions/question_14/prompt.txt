Document 1 (Title: Hepatitis B -- Treatment / Management -- Management): Acute hepatitis B infection is self cleared in 95% of healthy adults. Management is supportive in a majority of patients. Patients with severe acute disease (2 of the 3: bilirubin more than 10 mg/dl, INR more than 1.6 and hepatic encephalopathy) and protracted acute severe disease (total bilirubin more than 3 mg/dl or direct bilirubin more than 1.5 mg/dl, INR more than 1.5, hepatic encephalopathy, or ascites) need antiviral treatment.
Document 2 (Title: Surgical resection of tumor bulk in the primary treatment of ovarian carcinoma.): The effect of tumor bulk resection on survival was studied in 102 patients with stages II and III ovarian cancer. A multiple linear regression equation provuded both simultenaous control of multiple confounding variables and an assessment of these variables as independent predictors of survival. The most important factors were the histologic grade of the tumor and the size of the largest residual tumor mass after operation. Survival time was uniformly poor if the diameter of the largest residual tumor mass exceeded 1.5 cm irrespective of total tumor volume (mean=12.7 months, SE=1.6 mo). Survival time was inversely proportional to residual mass size under 1.6 cm, and surgery improved survival relative to reduction in mass size below this limit. Extensive resections of tumor bulk with failure to remove all masses greater than 1.5 cm in diameter did not influence survival. Surgery provides optimum benefit when all gross tumor can be excised safely.

Question: A 23-year-old man comes to the physician for evaluation of decreased hearing, dizziness, and ringing in his right ear for the past 6 months. Physical examination shows multiple soft, yellow plaques and papules on his arms, chest, and back. There is sensorineural hearing loss and weakness of facial muscles bilaterally. His gait is unsteady. An MRI of the brain shows a 3-cm mass near the right internal auditory meatus and a 2-cm mass at the left cerebellopontine angle. The abnormal cells in these masses are most likely derived from which of the following embryological structures?
Options:
A. Neural tube
B. Surface ectoderm
C. Neural crest
D. Notochord
