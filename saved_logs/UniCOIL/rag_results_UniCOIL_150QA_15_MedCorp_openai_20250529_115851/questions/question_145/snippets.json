        "title": "Influence of scheduling, dose, and volume of administration of a perfluorochemical emulsion on tumor response to radiation therapy.",
        "content": "Studies were carried out with a new, concentrated perfluorochemical emulsion (PFCE) of the perfluorochemical F44E (48% V/V). When given at 4, 1.6, or 1 g/kg in undiluted injection volumes iv 1 hr prior to a range of single doses of radiation with inspired carbogen dose modifying factors (DMF's) based on tumor growth delay (TGD) in the Lewis lung tumor of 2.5, 1.7, and 1.5, respectively, were produced. When the PFC dose was administered in a volume of 0.2 ml, the dose modifying factors produced by 4 g/kg (0.1 ml undiluted) did not change significantly (2.6), but the dose modifying factors produced by 1.6 g/kg (0.04 ml undiluted) and by 1.0 g/kg (0.025 ml undiluted) increased significantly to 2.0 and 1.8 (p less than 0.05), respectively. Using the tumor excision assay at 24 hr post treatment in the FSaIIC fibrosarcoma, administration of 6, 4, or 2 g/kg in 0.2 ml injections plus carbogen breathing 1 hr prior to and during treatment resulted in dose modifying factors of 1.5, 1.6, and 1.3, respectively. In a fractionated radiation protocol in the Lewis lung tumor using four daily fractions, a dose of 4 g/kg of PFC on days 1 and 3 proved superior to a dose of 2 g/kg daily (dose modifying factors 2.4 vs. 1.9, p less than 0.05). When a fractionated radiation regimen of 3 Gy daily X 5 and carbogen was used, PFC doses of 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 g/kg administered undiluted produced increasing tumor growth delays with increasing dose of PFCE and increasing frequency of administration. In addition, dilutions to 0.2 ml proved significantly more effective. In a 2-week fractionated radiation protocol using 2, 3, or 4 Gy daily X 5 weekly, PFCE given in 0.2 ml volume plus carbogen breathing daily at 4, 1.6, or 1 g/kg produced dose modifying factors of 2.0, 1.9, and 1.6, respectively. Finally, when used in a day 1, 3, and 5 radiation regimen for 3 weeks at 2, 3, or 4 Gy/fraction, 4 g/kg of PFCE given in a volume of 0.2 ml plus carbogen breathing produced a superior dose modifying factor (1.6) as compared with 1.6 or 1.0 g/kg (dose modifying factors 1.4 and 1.3, respectively). These results indicate that PFCE plus carbogen breathing effectively enhances the antitumor effects of both single dose and fractionated radiation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

The reduction by dithionite ion (in excess) of methemerythrin-anion adducts, Hr+X-, to deoxyhemerythrin, Hr degree, has been examined at 25 degrees and pH 6.3 and 8.2. The results accord with the scheme: S2O42- in equilibrium 2SO2- rapid Hr+X- in equilibrium Hr++X- k-1, k1 Hr++SO2- leads to PRODUCT k2 with X- = Br-, HCO2-, CNO-, and F-, k2[SO2-] greater than k1[X-], and the pseudo first-order rate constant, kobs (= k-1), is independent of [X-] and [S2O42-]. Only with X- = NCS- is k2[SO2-] approximately k1[X-] and kobs = a[S2O42-]1/2 (b[NCS-] + [S2OR2-]1/2)-1. Values at pH 6.3 of k-1 (sec-1) and k1 (M-1 sec-1), obtained by anation and anion displacement reactions, are 2.3 x 10(-3), 1.6 x 10(-2) (Br-); 1.5 x 10(-3), 1.2 x 10(-2) (HCO2-); 1.3 x 10(-4), 0.52 (CNO-) and approximately 2 x 10(-4), 3.3 x 10(-3) (CN-, pH 7.0). Values of k-1 from reduction and displacement methods are in good agreement with each other.

        "content": "In order to investigate the effect of environmentally determined conditions on the cytotoxicity of anticancer treatments, Hoechst 33342 dye selected tumor subpopulations were separated after in vivo treatment and plated for single cell colony survival. The 10% brightest cells were assayed as putative normally oxygenated cells and the 20% dimmest as putative hypoxic cells. At single therapeutic doses, cyclophosphamide treatment resulted in the largest differential killing between bright and dim cells (6.3-fold bright greater than dim); 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea was 3.2-fold more cytotoxic toward bright cells and carboplatin was 2.4-fold more toxic toward bright cells. Both radiation (10 Gy) and melphalan were 2.2-fold more toxic to bright cells, while cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) was 1.8-fold, thiotepa was 1.2-fold and procarbazine was 1.3-fold more toxic to bright cells. Actinomycin D was 3.4-fold more toxic to bright cells. Adriamycin was 2.2-fold, vincristine was 2.1-fold, and etoposide was 1.6-fold more toxic to bright cells. Bleomycin and 5-fluorouracil were also tested and were 1.5- and 2.3-fold more toxic to bright cells, respectively. Only four treatments were more toxic to dim cells: mitomycin C (3.5-fold), misonidazole (1.5-fold), etanidazole (3.5-fold), and 43 degrees C, 30 min local hyperthermia (2.6-fold). In an attempt to shift the pattern of dim cell sparing, Fluosol-DA plus carbogen (95% O2/5% CO2) breathing was added to treatment with radiation (10 Gy), melphalan, cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II), and etoposide. Although each of these treatments became significantly more toxic with the addition of Fluosol-DA/carbogen, only with melphalan did the combination overcome the sparing of dim cells. These results indicate that cells located distally from the tumor vasculature are significantly less affected by most anticancer drugs and suggest that successful therapeutic strategies against solid tumors will involve greater use of the few treatments which are more toxic toward this tumor subpopulation.",
