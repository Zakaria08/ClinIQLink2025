On admission to a hospital he was unconscious with a distinct debility for the left side of his body and showed a changing anisocoria. Angiography of the right carotid artery revealed an occlusion. It was suspected that this was the terminal state of a generalized arteriosclerotic occlusion which was considered being the reason for the accident. The autopsy-findings showed, however, a posttraumatic thrombosis (whiplash-trauma of the cervical vertebral column) of the right arteria carotis and of the right arteria vertebralis with thromboembolia in a small pontine artery with an infarct-like ischemic softening. The differentiation from an apoplexia is of importance for the differential diagnosis.",

It differs from a geared differential by using several small ball bearings rotating between two plates, instead of bevel gears. History The first ball differential for Radio-controlled Cars was designed by Cecil Schumacher, a British motor sport engineer working at Cosworth and founder/owner of his eponymous model brand. Although a patent was applied for, it was denied as the idea had already been implemented into a lawn mower. Radio-controlled cars were still a new application for the ball differential and Schumacher is generally considered the modern day inventor of the concept. Such was the popularity of the ball differential, originally applied in 1/12 on-road cars, that he formed his eponymous company.",
