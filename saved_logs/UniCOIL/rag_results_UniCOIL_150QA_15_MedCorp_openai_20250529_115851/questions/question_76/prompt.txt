Document 1 (Title: Radiation Therapy for Anal Cancer -- Epidemiology): The incidence of anal canal cancer has steadily increased over the past several years, particularly among women. Currently, anal cancer constitutes 0.5% of all cancer diagnoses in the United States. In 2018, estimates were that there were 8580 cases per year in the US (5620 in women and 2960 in men) and 1160 deaths per year in the US (680 in women and 480 in men). Anal cancer is primarily a disease of older adults, with an average age in the early 60s. However, in HIV-positive patients, there is an earlier onset of disease. [9]
Document 2 (Title: Anal vibrator): An anal vibrator is a vibrator designed for sexual stimulation of the anus of both men and women. All anal vibrators have one common feature: they produce a vibrating effect in the rectum for pleasurable sensations. Anal vibrators differ from other types of vibrators in that they have a flared base to prevent possible loss in the rectum. The average size of an anal vibrator is smaller than vibrators intended for vaginal penetration and may vary from 4-6 inches long and about 1 inch wide. As well as other vibrators designed for external and internal stimulation, anal vibrators are usually battery operated: the batteries may be inside the unit or connected by wire to a power pack. Unlike anal dildos, such as butt plugs, anal probes and anal beads, vibrating anal toys may produce various stimulating effects: rotating, vibrating or pulsating, and can have different speed or vibration levels to regulate and adjust the vibrator to various sensations.
Document 3 (Title: Gynecology_Novak): Fecal continence is provided primarily by the puborectalis muscle and the internal and external anal sphincters. The puborectalis surrounds the anal hiatus in the pelvic diaphragm and interdigitates posterior to the rectum to form a rectal sling. The external anal sphincter surrounds the terminal anal canal below the level of the levator ani. A growing body of literature suggests that both external anal sphincter and levator ani muscles are important for fecal continence and that multiple injuries contribute to pelvic ﬂoor dysfunction (29,30) One such MRI study showed that major levator ani muscle injuries were observed in 19.1% women who delivered vaginally with external anal sphincter injuries, 3.5% who delivered vaginally without external anal sphincter injury, and none of the women who delivered by cesarean section before labor. Among women with external anal sphincter injuries, those with major levator ani muscle injuries trended more toward fecal incontinence (29). Further
Document 4 (Title: Gynecology_Novak): 4. Palpate the anal canal and rectum with a well-lubricated, gloved index finger. Lay the pulp of the index finger against the anal orifice and instruct the subject to strain downward. Concomitant with the patient’s downward straining (which tends to relax the external sphincter muscle), exert upward pressure until the sphincter is felt to yield. Then, with a slight rotary movement, insinuate the finger past the anal canal into the rectum. Examine the anal canal systematically before exploring the rectum. 5. Evaluate the anal canal for: a. Tonus of the external sphincter muscle and the anorectal ring at the anorectal junction b. Tenderness (usually caused by a tight sphincter, anal fissure, or painful hemorrhoids) c. Tumor or irregularities, especially at the pectinate line d. Superior aspect: Reach as far as you can. Mild straining by the patient may cause some lesions, which are out of reach of the finger, to descend sufficiently low to be detected by palpation. e.
Document 5 (Title: Dynamic anal manometry: physiological variations and pathophysiological findings in fecal incontinence.): A recently developed technique for dynamic anal manometry was used to study 40 healthy volunteers and 23 patients with fecal incontinence. Seven parameters of anal function were measured. Intraindividual variation of the parameters was studied in 5 females and 5 males. The results of dynamic anal manometry were compared with standard pull-through static anal manometry and correlated well. During opening of the anal sphincter at rest, compliance increased with increasing distension. Males had higher maximal closing pressures during squeeze and lower anal compliance during squeeze than females. There was no sex differences of the sphincter measurements at rest. Age had little effect, and gender had no effect on the measurements. With standard anal manometry, 6 of 23 patients with fecal incontinence both had maximal resting pressure and maximal squeeze pressure within the normal range. When dynamic anal manometry was used, all 23 patients showed one or more abnormal values. The method of dynamic anal manometry p...
