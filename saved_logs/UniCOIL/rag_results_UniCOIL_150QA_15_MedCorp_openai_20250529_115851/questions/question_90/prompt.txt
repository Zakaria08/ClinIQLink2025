Document 2 (Title: Liver cancer): Liver cancer (also known as hepatic cancer, primary hepatic cancer, or primary hepatic malignancy) is cancer that starts in the liver. Liver cancer can be primary (starts in liver) or secondary (meaning cancer which has spread from elsewhere to the liver, known as liver metastasis). Liver metastasis is more common than that which starts in the liver. Liver cancer is increasing globally. Primary liver cancer is globally the sixth-most frequent cancer and the fourth-leading cause of death from cancer. In 2018, it occurred in 841,000 people and resulted in 782,000 deaths globally. Higher rates of liver cancer occur where hepatitis B and C are common, including Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Males are more often affected with HCC than females. Diagnosis is most frequent among those 55 to 65 years old.
Document 3 (Title: Alternatives in the surgical management of in situ breast cancer. A meta-analysis of outcome.): The surgical management of lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) remains controversial. For in situ breast cancer local excision (LE), local excision and radiation therapy (LERT) and mastectomy (MAST) have all been advocated. A search of the English literature found 13 reports concerning the surgical management of LCIS and 12 reports concerning the management of DCIS. The data were combined in a meta-analysis of outcome. As expected, recurrence rates following LE with both LCIS 8.4%) and DCIS (17%) are high. However,the overall mortality following mastectomy for recurrence, LCIS (2.8%) and DCIS (2.3%) does not differ statistically from those treated initially with mastectomy for LCIS (0.9%) and DCIS (1.7%). We conclude from these data that local recurrence after breast conserving procedures for in situ breast cancer does not carry an ominous prognosis. This knowledge should aid in planning individual therapy.
Document 4 (Title: Alcohol and cancer): A 2011 meta-analysis found that alcohol consumption was associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer. Liver cancer Alcohol is a risk factor for liver cancer, through cirrhosis.Liver Cancer Risk Factors. cancer.org "Cirrhosis results from scar formation within the liver, most commonly due to chronic alcohol use." "Approximately 5 percent of people with cirrhosis develop liver cancer. Cirrhosis is a disease that develops when liver cells are replaced with scar tissue after damage from alcohol abuse, …" The NIAAA reports that "Prolonged, heavy drinking has been associated in many cases with primary liver cancer." However, it is liver cirrhosis, whether caused by alcohol or another factor, that is thought to induce the cancer." "The chances of getting liver cancer increase markedly with five or more drinks per day" (NCI). A study concluded that for every additional drink regularly consumed per day, the incidence of liver cancer increases by 0.7 per 1000.
Document 5 (Title: Physiology, Vision -- Clinical Significance -- Improper Color Vision Recognition/Color Blindness): Many forms of color vision recognition abnormalities are present in the population, with most having a genetic origin. Very few individuals are truly color blind, but instead, individuals who are considered color-blind see a disrupted range of colors. The most common forms are protanopia and deuteranopia, conditions arising from loss of function of one of the cones, leading to dichromic vision. Protanopia is the loss of L cones (red) resulting in green-blue vision only. Deuteranopia is the loss of M cones (green) resulting in red-blue vision only. Both are X-linked alleles, therefore almost exclusively occurring in males, occurring with a prevalence of 1%. Loss of S cones does rarely occur in 0.01% of males and females. In these cases, one of the cones does not function, and one of the others is expressed instead in its place.
