Data were evaluated for 1.0 T and 1.5 T separately and combined. In the combined evaluation, T2*-FLASH had good S/N (23.1 + 5.1) but low SD/N (2.9 + 1.7) and suffered from susceptibility artifacts.

Data were evaluated for 1.0 T and 1.5 T separately and combined. In the combined evaluation, T2*-FLASH had good S/N (23.1 + 5.1) but low SD/N (2.9 + 1.7) and suffered from susceptibility artifacts. T2* PSIF had good S/N (28.1 + 10.0) and moderate SD/N (6.0 + 2.4), but occasionally had heterogeneous signal intensity. Flow signal void was an attractive feature. T2 RASE had very low S/N (4.4 + 1.9) and low SD/N (2.3 + 1.1) and suffered from flow artifacts. T2-Turbo had good S/N (24.6 + 8.6) and SD/N (8.9 + 2.5). Flow signal void was present, but small matrix size decreased image quality. The results of our study suggest that T2*-PSIF and T2-Turbo have good S/N and SD/N and fair image quality which may be clinically useful for breath-hold T2-weighted sequences of the liver.",
