        "title": "Influence of scheduling, dose, and volume of administration of a perfluorochemical emulsion on tumor response to radiation therapy.",
        "content": "Studies were carried out with a new, concentrated perfluorochemical emulsion (PFCE) of the perfluorochemical F44E (48% V/V). When given at 4, 1.6, or 1 g/kg in undiluted injection volumes iv 1 hr prior to a range of single doses of radiation with inspired carbogen dose modifying factors (DMF's) based on tumor growth delay (TGD) in the Lewis lung tumor of 2.5, 1.7, and 1.5, respectively, were produced. When the PFC dose was administered in a volume of 0.2 ml, the dose modifying factors produced by 4 g/kg (0.1 ml undiluted) did not change significantly (2.6), but the dose modifying factors produced by 1.6 g/kg (0.04 ml undiluted) and by 1.0 g/kg (0.025 ml undiluted) increased significantly to 2.0 and 1.8 (p less than 0.05), respectively. Using the tumor excision assay at 24 hr post treatment in the FSaIIC fibrosarcoma, administration of 6, 4, or 2 g/kg in 0.2 ml injections plus carbogen breathing 1 hr prior to and during treatment resulted in dose modifying factors of 1.5, 1.6, and 1.3, respectively. In a fractionated radiation protocol in the Lewis lung tumor using four daily fractions, a dose of 4 g/kg of PFC on days 1 and 3 proved superior to a dose of 2 g/kg daily (dose modifying factors 2.4 vs. 1.9, p less than 0.05). When a fractionated radiation regimen of 3 Gy daily X 5 and carbogen was used, PFC doses of 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 g/kg administered undiluted produced increasing tumor growth delays with increasing dose of PFCE and increasing frequency of administration. In addition, dilutions to 0.2 ml proved significantly more effective. In a 2-week fractionated radiation protocol using 2, 3, or 4 Gy daily X 5 weekly, PFCE given in 0.2 ml volume plus carbogen breathing daily at 4, 1.6, or 1 g/kg produced dose modifying factors of 2.0, 1.9, and 1.6, respectively. Finally, when used in a day 1, 3, and 5 radiation regimen for 3 weeks at 2, 3, or 4 Gy/fraction, 4 g/kg of PFCE given in a volume of 0.2 ml plus carbogen breathing produced a superior dose modifying factor (1.6) as compared with 1.6 or 1.0 g/kg (dose modifying factors 1.4 and 1.3, respectively). These results indicate that PFCE plus carbogen breathing effectively enhances the antitumor effects of both single dose and fractionated radiation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

        "content": "The effect of tumor bulk resection on survival was studied in 102 patients with stages II and III ovarian cancer. A multiple linear regression equation provuded both simultenaous control of multiple confounding variables and an assessment of these variables as independent predictors of survival. The most important factors were the histologic grade of the tumor and the size of the largest residual tumor mass after operation. Survival time was uniformly poor if the diameter of the largest residual tumor mass exceeded 1.5 cm irrespective of total tumor volume (mean=12.7 months, SE=1.6 mo). Survival time was inversely proportional to residual mass size under 1.6 cm, and surgery improved survival relative to reduction in mass size below this limit. Extensive resections of tumor bulk with failure to remove all masses greater than 1.5 cm in diameter did not influence survival. Surgery provides optimum benefit when all gross tumor can be excised safely.",

        "content": "A cohort of 3637 female and 168 male hair-dressers in Finland was followed up for cancer through the Finnish Cancer Registry in 1970-1987. Compared with the total population, the women had a significantly elevated risk (standardized incidence ratio 1.7) during the first third of the observation period, but not thereafter. For the total follow-up period, the relative risks were highest for nonmelanoma skin cancer (2.0), lung cancer (1.7), ovarian cancer (1.6), cervical cancer (1.5), and cancer of the pancreas (1.5); only the risk of ovarian cancer was statistically significant. A decrease in relative risk with time was observed for many primary sites, e.g., pancreas, cervix uteri, central nervous system, and thyroid. The opposite was true for lung and skin: An increased risk was found only in 1982-1987. The excess was most prominent in the oldest age groups with the longest time span since the first employment as a hairdresser. Among men, too, the general cancer risk was highest (1.6) during the first third of the observation period. An excess of cancers of the lung and the pancreas was observed. The small numbers, however, did not allow any further conclusions. The changes in the cancer risk pattern over time may be associated with changes in working conditions in hairdressing salons.",
