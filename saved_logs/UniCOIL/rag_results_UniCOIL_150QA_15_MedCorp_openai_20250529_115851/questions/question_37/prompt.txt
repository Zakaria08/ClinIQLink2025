Document 2 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Unburned cured tobacco used orally contains nicotine, carcinogens, and other toxicants capable of causing gum disease, oral and pancreatic cancers, and an increase in the risk of heart disease. When tobacco is burned, the resultant smoke contains, in addition to nicotine, more than 7000 other compounds that result from volatilization, pyrolysis, and pyrosynthesis of tobacco and various chemical additives used in making different tobacco products. The smoke is composed of a fine aerosol and a vapor phase; aerosolized particles are of a size range that results in deposition in the airways and alveolar surfaces of the lungs.

Document 5 (Title: Relation of baseline microbial parameters to future periodontal attachment loss.): The relationship between the level of subgingival species at baseline and subsequent attachment loss in a subject was examined. 38 subjects (14-71 years) with prior evidence of periodontal destruction were monitored 2x for pocket depth and attachment level at 6 sites per tooth at baseline and 2 months. A subject was considered to exhibit new attachment loss if 1 or more sites increased 3 mm or more in attachment level in 2 months. Subgingival plaque samples were taken at the baseline visit from the mesial aspect of each tooth (28 sites) using Gracey curettes. Samples were dispersed, diluted and plated on Trypticase soy agar supplemented with 5% sheep blood. After 7 days of anaerobic incubation, the colonies were lifted onto nylon filters, lysed and the DNA fixed to the filters. Digoxygenin-labeled DNA probes were used to enumerate 14 subgingival species. 17 of 38 subjects (44.7%) exhibited new attachment loss in 2 months. The % of the total viable count of each species was averaged for each subject. The speci...

Question: A 6-year-old male who recently immigrated to the United States from Asia is admitted to the hospital with dyspnea.

Which of the following would have prevented this patient's presentation and decline?
Options:
A. Increased CD4+ T cell count
B. Secretory IgA against viral proteins
