Below the critical micellar concentration of Triton X100 (TtX), the three glycoproteins do not bind appreciably to TtX and form association products of large size. The size-exclusion chromatographic patterns of GPIIb, GPIIIa and GPIIb/IIIa have been obtained at 0.2% TtX, and the molecular properties of the association products and monomer fractions have been determined by analysis of the detergent bound to the glycoproteins, laser-light scattering, sedimentation velocity, and electron microscopy (TEM). The monomer of the GPIIb-TtX complex was identified by the molecular mass (M) of the glycoprotein moiety (125 +/- 15 kDa), the molecular size (9.5 +/- 1.5 nm x 11 +/- 1.5 nm) and globular shape observed by TEM. It has a molecular mass (M*) of 197 +/- 20 kDa, a sedimentation coefficient s degrees 20* of 5.8 +/- 0.1 S, a Stokes radius R s* of 6.8 +/- 0.4 nm, and a frictional ratio f*/fmin* of 1.7 +/- 0.14. The (GPIIb)n-TtX complexes are disulphide-bonded size-heterogeneous association products of GPIIb, tetramers being the smallest species found.

        "content": "1. We have estimated free, intracellular calcium ion concentrations ([Ca]i) in isolated retinal ganglion cells of adult goldfish by ratio-imaging fura-2 emission intensity at two excitation wavelengths. Here we describe [Ca]i in these cells, both at rest and during depolarization by elevated levels of extracellular potassium ions ([K]o). 2. [K]o was varied between 5 and 60 mM in sodium-free, tetrodotoxin-containing salines. Ganglion cell membrane potential, measured with patch electrodes, fell with each increment of [K]o used, from approximately -70 mV in 5 mM K+ to approximately -20 mV in 60 mM K+. 3. In control saline, [Ca]i was roughly 120 nM in cell somata and at least twofold higher in their growth cones. [Ca]i increased in both somata and growth cones to as high as 1.5 microM in salines containing 60 mM K+. [Ca]i exceeded 1.5 microM in some cells in high-K+ salines, although these levels could not be quantified accurately with fura-2. 4. Increases in [Ca]i elicited by elevated [K]o persisted for the duration of the exposure to high-K+ saline and were blocked by replacement of most of the bath Ca2+ by Co2+. These increases in [Ca]i were also sensitive to dihydropyridine calcium-channel ligands, viz., enhanced by BAY K 8644 (3 microM) and antagonized by nifedipine (10 microM). 5. Partial recovery of control [Ca]i occurred when [K]o was reduced to 5 mM after exposure to high-K+ saline and in high-K+ saline when nifedipine was included. These results show that goldfish retinal ganglion cells can partially buffer intracellular Ca2+ in the absence of extracellular Na+ ions. 6. These results provide measurements of the changes in [Ca]i brought about by depolarization of goldfish retinal ganglion cells in Na(+)-free salines. In these salines, at least part of the increase in [Ca]i appears to result from Ca2+ influx through a voltage-activated, noninactivating calcium conductance in the somata and growth cones of these cells. These measurements complement whole-cell patch-clamp and vibrating microprobe recordings from the somata and neurites of these cells and also immunocytochemical studies and patch-clamp measurements in amphibian, reptilian, and mammalian retinal ganglion cells.",

        "content": "The effects of DBcAMP in doses from 1.5 x 10(-8) to 1.5 x 10(-3) M on the compartmental apparent surface area (ASA) and (5(-3H)uridine radioactivity concentration (URC), (methyl-3H)thymidine labelling index per 1 hour ([Me-3H]Tdr LI/h) and per cent mitotic index (MI%) and colchicine metaphase index (CMI%) of young rat differentiated hepatocytes in primary tissue culture were investigated by morphometric and radioautographie methods. In these cells DBcAMP was found to elicit: (1) progressive increments in the ASA of nucleoli, karyoplasm and cytoplasm; (2) peak increases in nucleolar URC at 1.5 x 10(-8) and 10(-5) M, but a slight decrease at 1.5 x 10(-3) M; (3) singificant increments in karyoplasmic and total nuclear URC at all doses, except at 1.5 x 10(-6) and 10(-4) M, when such parameters remained at control levels; (4) steady and progressive increases in cytoplasmic and total cell URC values; (5) marked increments in (Me-3H)Tdr LI/h, MI% and CMI% up to the dose of 1.5 x 10(-4) M, but at 1.5 x 10(-3) M these parameters were found to be either much less enhanced or to approach closely to control values. cAMP in doses from 1.5 x 10(-8) to 10(-4) M also markedly incremented the in vitro hepatocyte CMI%, while having a lesser stimulatory effect at 1.5 x 10(-3)M. Finally of the various possible metabolites of DBcAMP administered at 1.5 x 10(-8) M to liver cultures, N6- and O2'-MBcAMP and, again, cAMP significantly increased the CMI%, of cultured hepatocytes, whereas 5'-AMP, adenosine and allantoin had no significant effect and Na-butyrate slightly decreased it.
