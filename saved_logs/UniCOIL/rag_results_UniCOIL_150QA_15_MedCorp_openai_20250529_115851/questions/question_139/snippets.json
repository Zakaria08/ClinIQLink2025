        "title": "Influence of scheduling, dose, and volume of administration of a perfluorochemical emulsion on tumor response to radiation therapy.",
        "content": "Studies were carried out with a new, concentrated perfluorochemical emulsion (PFCE) of the perfluorochemical F44E (48% V/V). When given at 4, 1.6, or 1 g/kg in undiluted injection volumes iv 1 hr prior to a range of single doses of radiation with inspired carbogen dose modifying factors (DMF's) based on tumor growth delay (TGD) in the Lewis lung tumor of 2.5, 1.7, and 1.5, respectively, were produced. When the PFC dose was administered in a volume of 0.2 ml, the dose modifying factors produced by 4 g/kg (0.1 ml undiluted) did not change significantly (2.6), but the dose modifying factors produced by 1.6 g/kg (0.04 ml undiluted) and by 1.0 g/kg (0.025 ml undiluted) increased significantly to 2.0 and 1.8 (p less than 0.05), respectively. Using the tumor excision assay at 24 hr post treatment in the FSaIIC fibrosarcoma, administration of 6, 4, or 2 g/kg in 0.2 ml injections plus carbogen breathing 1 hr prior to and during treatment resulted in dose modifying factors of 1.5, 1.6, and 1.3, respectively. In a fractionated radiation protocol in the Lewis lung tumor using four daily fractions, a dose of 4 g/kg of PFC on days 1 and 3 proved superior to a dose of 2 g/kg daily (dose modifying factors 2.4 vs. 1.9, p less than 0.05). When a fractionated radiation regimen of 3 Gy daily X 5 and carbogen was used, PFC doses of 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 g/kg administered undiluted produced increasing tumor growth delays with increasing dose of PFCE and increasing frequency of administration. In addition, dilutions to 0.2 ml proved significantly more effective. In a 2-week fractionated radiation protocol using 2, 3, or 4 Gy daily X 5 weekly, PFCE given in 0.2 ml volume plus carbogen breathing daily at 4, 1.6, or 1 g/kg produced dose modifying factors of 2.0, 1.9, and 1.6, respectively. Finally, when used in a day 1, 3, and 5 radiation regimen for 3 weeks at 2, 3, or 4 Gy/fraction, 4 g/kg of PFCE given in a volume of 0.2 ml plus carbogen breathing produced a superior dose modifying factor (1.6) as compared with 1.6 or 1.0 g/kg (dose modifying factors 1.4 and 1.3, respectively). These results indicate that PFCE plus carbogen breathing effectively enhances the antitumor effects of both single dose and fractionated radiation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

        "content": "The stereoselective binding of six pairs of basic, one pair of acidic drug enantiomers, and one pair of diastereomers for human alpha 1-acid glycoprotein was investigated by means of competition experiments against [3H]propranolol- or [14C]nicardipine-labelled binding sites using equilibrium dialysis to separate free from bound marker ligand. The affinity constants (Ka) for association of [3H]propranolol and [14C]nicardipine with alpha 1-AGP were 1.2 +/- 0.6 X 10(5) M-1 and 3.4 +/- 1.4 X 10(5) M-1, respectively, and control binding amounted to 57 +/- 7 and 91 +/- 2%, respectively.

When the calculation of radioligand-free fractions is also taken into account, it is apparent that only the tilidine isomers show no selectivity at propranolol-marked, and the disopyramide isomers at nicardipine-marked alpha 1-AGP-binding sites, in all other cases, a weak selectivity is detectable, which is, however, far below the values obtained for most neurotransmitter receptors. It is concluded that the single drug binding site of alpha 1-AGP is only slightly stereoselective and that the stereoselective binding of the drugs investigated is probably of no clinical consequence.",
