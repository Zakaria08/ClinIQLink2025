Although autologous blood is free of such risks as transfusion-transmitted diseases, the safety and effectiveness of autologous donations by cardiac patients are debated.

One hundred seven (36.8%) donated between 1 and 6 U of autologous blood (mean, 3.0 +/- 1.5 U) before undergoing surgery. First-time elective coronary artery bypass surgery was the most common indication for autologous donation (90.6% of autologous donors). Problems following donations were infrequent (2 of 326 donations) and without long-term consequences. Among patients having coronary artery bypass surgery who donated autologous blood, 27% required homologous blood transfusions as compared with 82% of other patients undergoing the same procedure.

Symptomatic improvement occurred in 91% (73 of 80). In 43 patients with patent graft(s), pre-angiographic LVEDP and EF were unchanged (p always greater than 0.05), while postangiographic LVEDP was significantly reduced. Unchanged pre- and postangiographic LVEDP and EF were observed in 28 patients with double or triple grafts, with at least one graft patent and the other(s) occluded. Unchanged pre- and postangiographic LVEDP and reduced EF were observed in 9 patients with occluded single, double or triple grafts. We conclude that successful aorto-coronary saphenous vein bypass surgery in general does not improve resting left ventricular performance, but that the beneficial effect on left ventricular function can be demonstrated after a stress test such as ventriculography. A single graft to the left anterior descending artery seems to be of particular importance in this connection.
