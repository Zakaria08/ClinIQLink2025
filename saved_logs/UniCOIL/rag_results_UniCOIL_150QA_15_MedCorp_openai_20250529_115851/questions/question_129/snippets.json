        "content": "Studies were carried out with a new, concentrated perfluorochemical emulsion (PFCE) of the perfluorochemical F44E (48% V/V). When given at 4, 1.6, or 1 g/kg in undiluted injection volumes iv 1 hr prior to a range of single doses of radiation with inspired carbogen dose modifying factors (DMF's) based on tumor growth delay (TGD) in the Lewis lung tumor of 2.5, 1.7, and 1.5, respectively, were produced. When the PFC dose was administered in a volume of 0.2 ml, the dose modifying factors produced by 4 g/kg (0.1 ml undiluted) did not change significantly (2.6), but the dose modifying factors produced by 1.6 g/kg (0.04 ml undiluted) and by 1.0 g/kg (0.025 ml undiluted) increased significantly to 2.0 and 1.8 (p less than 0.05), respectively. Using the tumor excision assay at 24 hr post treatment in the FSaIIC fibrosarcoma, administration of 6, 4, or 2 g/kg in 0.2 ml injections plus carbogen breathing 1 hr prior to and during treatment resulted in dose modifying factors of 1.5, 1.6, and 1.3, respectively. In a fractionated radiation protocol in the Lewis lung tumor using four daily fractions, a dose of 4 g/kg of PFC on days 1 and 3 proved superior to a dose of 2 g/kg daily (dose modifying factors 2.4 vs. 1.9, p less than 0.05). When a fractionated radiation regimen of 3 Gy daily X 5 and carbogen was used, PFC doses of 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 g/kg administered undiluted produced increasing tumor growth delays with increasing dose of PFCE and increasing frequency of administration. In addition, dilutions to 0.2 ml proved significantly more effective. In a 2-week fractionated radiation protocol using 2, 3, or 4 Gy daily X 5 weekly, PFCE given in 0.2 ml volume plus carbogen breathing daily at 4, 1.6, or 1 g/kg produced dose modifying factors of 2.0, 1.9, and 1.6, respectively. Finally, when used in a day 1, 3, and 5 radiation regimen for 3 weeks at 2, 3, or 4 Gy/fraction, 4 g/kg of PFCE given in a volume of 0.2 ml plus carbogen breathing produced a superior dose modifying factor (1.6) as compared with 1.6 or 1.0 g/kg (dose modifying factors 1.4 and 1.3, respectively). These results indicate that PFCE plus carbogen breathing effectively enhances the antitumor effects of both single dose and fractionated radiation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

        "content": "We investigated the effects of short term glucocorticoid excess on the gonadotropic and somatotropic axes in healthy men. Subjects (n = 5) underwent blood sampling at 10-min intervals for 6 h before and on days 2, 5, and 8 of glucocorticoid treatment, and for 24 h (n = 6) to examine pulsatile LH and GH release before and during dexamethasone administration (1.5 mg orally twice daily for 1 week). In the time-course study, we found significant decreases on day 8 in serum concentrations of estradiol (from 144 +/- 18 to 99 +/- 18 pmol/L), free testosterone (from 105 +/- 10 to 87 +/- 10 pmol/L), and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (from 6.0 +/- 1.6 to 1.7 +/- 0.3 mumol/L; P less than 0.05). Mean serum LH concentrations did not change (baseline, 5.3 +/- 1.2 IU/L; glucocorticoid, 4.2 +/- 0.61 IU/L). The mean plasma somatomedin-C concentration rose from 0.74 +/- 0.08 to 2.0 +/- 0.35 U/mL (P less than 0.05), and the mean serum GH concentration increased from 1.2 +/- 0.90 micrograms/L (basal) to 4.2 +/- 1.5 micrograms/L (day 8 of dexamethasone; P less than 0.01). Deconvolution analysis of 24-h serum GH and LH concentration profiles revealed that the half-life of endogenous GH and the duration and amplitude (maximal rate of secretion) of computer-resolved GH secretory bursts were not influenced significantly by dexamethasone. The mass of GH secreted per burst rose 1.6-fold. Glucocorticoid treatment also increased detectable GH secretory burst frequency from 12 +/- 1.6 to 18 +/- 1.6 episodes/24 h, decreased the GH interburst interval from 127 +/- 23 to 79 +/- 5 min, and increased the daily GH secretion rate from 41 +/- 11 to 101 +/- 11 micrograms/L.day. These effects on the somatotropic axis were specific, since the half-life of LH; LH secretory burst frequency, amplitude, mass, and duration; and the total daily LH production rate (and LH secretion in response to exogenous GnRH) were not altered by dexamethasone administration. We conclude that short term moderate glucocorticoid excess augments pulsatile GH secretion without influencing the episodic release of LH in normal men.",

        "content": "The enzyme 3-methylaspartate ammonia-lyase (EC 4.3.1.2) catalyzes the exchange of the C-3 hydrogen of the substrate, (2S,3S)-3-methylaspartic acid, with solvent hydrogen. The mechanism of the exchange reaction was probed using (2S,3S)-3-methylaspartic acid and its C-3-deuteriated isotopomer. Incubations conducted in tritiated water allowed the rate of protium or deuterium wash-out from the substrates to be measured as tritium wash-in. The primary deuterium isotope effects for the exchange under essentially Vmax conditions ( [S] much greater than Km) were 1.6, 1.5, and 1.5 at pH 9.0, 7.6, and 6.5. The deamination reaction, measured spectrophotometrically on the same incubations, showed isotope effects of 1.7, 1.6, and 1.4 at pH 9.0, 7.6, and 6.5, in agreement with the values of DV and D(V/K) reported previously [Botting, N.P., Akhtar, M., Cohen, M.A., &amp; Gani, D. (1988) Biochemistry 27, 2956-2959]. The ratio of the rate of exchange to the rate of deamination, however, varied widely with pH. Together with the identical values of the primary isotope effects for the two reactions, this result indicates that the partition between reaction pathways occurs after the slowest steps in the common part of the reaction coordinate pathway, almost certainly after the cleavage of the C-N bond at the level of the enzyme-ammonia-mesaconic acid complex, and not at the putative carbanion level as was previously suggested. The enzyme requires both K+ and Mg2+ ions for activity, although ammonium ion is also able to bind in the K+ site and act as an activator. Variation of the metal ion concentration alters the magnitude of the primary deuterium isotope effects. The variation of potassium ion concentration causes the most marked changes: at 1.6 mM K+, DV and D(V/K) are 1.7, whereas at 50 mM K+, DV and D(V/K) are reduced to 1.0. The isotope effects are also reduced at low K+ concentration due to the emergence of a slow-acting high K+ affinity monopotassium form of the enzyme. The binding order and role of the metal ion cofactors and their influence in determining the formal mechanism of the reaction is discussed, and the failure of previous workers to observe primary deuterium isotope effects for the deamination process is explained.
