During RNA maturation, trans splicing transfers the first 39 nucleotides of the SL RNA including the cap structure to the 5' end of all mRNAs. Here we show that exposure of permeable trypanosome cells to S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine inhibits methylation of the nucleosides adjacent to 7-methylguanosine of newly synthesized SL RNA and prevents utilization of the SL RNA in trans splicing. However, trans splicing of the SL RNA preexisting in the cells is not inhibited by S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine as shown by the observation that newly synthesized alpha-tubulin RNA is trans spliced at the same level as in control cells. Therefore, it appears that the newly synthesized SL RNA is the only known component of the trans-splicing machinery that is impaired in its function by inhibition of methylation. Undermethylation does not alter either the stability of the SL RNA or the electrophoretic mobility and chromatographic behavior of the core SL ribonucleoprotein particle.

The reduction of tetraplatin to dichloro(d,l-trans)-1,2-diaminocyclohexaneplatinum(II) [PtCl2(dach)] was extremely rapid. From experiments with diluted plasma, it was possible to estimate a t1/2 for tetraplatin of approximately 3 s at 37 degrees C in undiluted plasma. By titrating with N-ethylmaleimide, it was possible to show that sulfhydryl groups were responsible for 70-80% of the total reducing potential of plasma. The rapid reduction of tetraplatin to PtCl2(dach) was followed by slower substitution reactions involving the chloro ligands of PtCl2(dach). The t1/2 for PtCl2(dach) in plasma at 37 degrees C was 1.5 h. The monoaquamonochloro complex was an important biotransformation product at early times, reaching 10 to 12% of the total platinum present from 15 min to 2 h, when it was gradually replaced with more stable biotransformation products.

Patients with diastolic valve doming, usually accompanied by a history of rheumatic fever, are defined as having stage A MS, even with normal trans-mitral flow velocities. Stage B MS is defined by an increased transmitral flow velocity with mitral valve area greater than 1.5 cm2. This condition is associated with mild to moderate left atrial enlargement but normal pulmonary arterial pressure. Stage C MS consists of a severely stenotic valve (mitral valve area ≤1.5 cm2) without symptoms. This is frequently associated with commissural fusion and diastolic doming of the leaflets as well as a pulmonary arterial pressure of >30 mmHg. Stage D MS is defined as the aforementioned criteria with the onset of decreased exercise tolerance and/or dyspnea on exertion (Table 21-8).98The onset of symptoms is due to the evolution of patho-physiological processes, beginning with an elevation in left atrial pressure.
