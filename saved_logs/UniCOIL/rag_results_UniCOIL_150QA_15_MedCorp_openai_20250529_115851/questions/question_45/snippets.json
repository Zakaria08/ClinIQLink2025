        "content": "Studies were carried out with a new, concentrated perfluorochemical emulsion (PFCE) of the perfluorochemical F44E (48% V/V). When given at 4, 1.6, or 1 g/kg in undiluted injection volumes iv 1 hr prior to a range of single doses of radiation with inspired carbogen dose modifying factors (DMF's) based on tumor growth delay (TGD) in the Lewis lung tumor of 2.5, 1.7, and 1.5, respectively, were produced. When the PFC dose was administered in a volume of 0.2 ml, the dose modifying factors produced by 4 g/kg (0.1 ml undiluted) did not change significantly (2.6), but the dose modifying factors produced by 1.6 g/kg (0.04 ml undiluted) and by 1.0 g/kg (0.025 ml undiluted) increased significantly to 2.0 and 1.8 (p less than 0.05), respectively. Using the tumor excision assay at 24 hr post treatment in the FSaIIC fibrosarcoma, administration of 6, 4, or 2 g/kg in 0.2 ml injections plus carbogen breathing 1 hr prior to and during treatment resulted in dose modifying factors of 1.5, 1.6, and 1.3, respectively. In a fractionated radiation protocol in the Lewis lung tumor using four daily fractions, a dose of 4 g/kg of PFC on days 1 and 3 proved superior to a dose of 2 g/kg daily (dose modifying factors 2.4 vs. 1.9, p less than 0.05). When a fractionated radiation regimen of 3 Gy daily X 5 and carbogen was used, PFC doses of 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 g/kg administered undiluted produced increasing tumor growth delays with increasing dose of PFCE and increasing frequency of administration. In addition, dilutions to 0.2 ml proved significantly more effective. In a 2-week fractionated radiation protocol using 2, 3, or 4 Gy daily X 5 weekly, PFCE given in 0.2 ml volume plus carbogen breathing daily at 4, 1.6, or 1 g/kg produced dose modifying factors of 2.0, 1.9, and 1.6, respectively. Finally, when used in a day 1, 3, and 5 radiation regimen for 3 weeks at 2, 3, or 4 Gy/fraction, 4 g/kg of PFCE given in a volume of 0.2 ml plus carbogen breathing produced a superior dose modifying factor (1.6) as compared with 1.6 or 1.0 g/kg (dose modifying factors 1.4 and 1.3, respectively). These results indicate that PFCE plus carbogen breathing effectively enhances the antitumor effects of both single dose and fractionated radiation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

        "content": "The incidence of cancer was studied in a population-based cohort of 9,353 individuals (8,340 men and 1,013 women) with a discharge diagnosis of alcoholism in 1965-83, followed up for 19 years (mean 7.7). After exclusion of cancers in the first year of follow-up, 491 cancers were observed cf 343.2 expected through 1984 (standardized incidence ratio [SIR] = 1.4, 95 percent confidence interval [CI] = 1.3-1.6). A similar excess risk of cancer was seen among men (SIR = 1.4, CI = 1.3-1.6) and among women (SIR = 1.5, CI = 1.1-2.0). We observed the established associations with cancers of the oral cavity and pharynx (SIR = 4.1, CI = 2.9-5.7), esophagus (SIR = 6.8, CI = 4.5-9.9), larynx (SIR = 3.3, CI = 1.7-6.0), and lung (SIR = 2.1, CI = 1.7-2.6), although confounding by smoking likely increased these risk estimates. While there was evidence of increased risk for pancreatic cancer (SIR = 1.5, CI = 0.9-2.3), alcoholism did not elevate the incidence of cancer of the stomach (SIR = 0.9, CI = 6-1.4), large bowel (SIR = 1.1, CI = 0.8-1.5), prostate (SIR = 1.0, CI = 0.8-1.3), urinary bladder (SIR = 1.0, CI = 0.6-1.5), or of malignant melanoma (SIR = 0.9, CI = 0.3-1.9). Among women, the number of breast cancers observed was close to expected (SIR = 1.2, CI = 0.6-2.2), although a significant excess number of cervical cancers occurred (SIR = 4.2, CI = 1.5-9.1).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

The incidence of cancer was studied in a population-based cohort of 9,353 individuals (8,340 men and 1,013 women) with a discharge diagnosis of alcoholism in 1965-83, followed up for 19 years (mean 7.7).

        "content": "A retrospective follow-up study of 7338 women with either nontoxic nodular goiter, thyroid adenoma, hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, or no thyroid disease was conducted. All women patients at the Massachusetts General Hospital Thyroid Clinic who were seen between 1925 and 1974 and who were treated for a minimum of 1 year were traced. A total of 2231 women (30.4%) were dead and 2012 women (27.4%) were alive as of December 31, 1978. Partial follow-up information was available for the remaining 3095 women (42.2%). The average length of follow-up was 15.2 years. When losses to follow-up were withdrawn at the time of their loss, the standardized mortality ratios (SMR) for all causes of death were 1.2 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.1-1.3] for women with nontoxic nodular goiter, 1.2 (95% CI 1.0-1.3) for those with thyroid adenoma, 1.4 (95% CI 1.3-1.5) for women with hyperthyroidism, 1.5 (95% CI 1.3-1.7) for hypothyroid women, 1.2 (95% CI 0.9-1.5) for those with Hashimoto's thyroiditis, and 1.5 (95% CI 1.4-1.6) for those without thyroid disease. For deaths from all cancers, the standardized mortality ratios were 1.5 (95% CI 1.2-1.8) for women with nontoxic nodular goiter, 1.5 (95% CI 1.1-1.9) for those with thyroid adenoma, 1.2 (95% CI 1.0-1.4) for women with hyperthyroidism, 1.0 (95% CI 0.7-1.4) for the hypothyroid women, 1.2 (95% CI 0.7-2.1) for those with Hashimoto's thyroiditis, and 1.3 (95% CI 1.0-1.5) for those women without thyroid disease. When specific cancer sites were studied, excess numbers of deaths were observed from breast cancer in women with nontoxic nodular goiter (SMR = 1.6, 95% CI 1.0-2.6) and from lymphatic and hematopoietic cancer in women with nontoxic nodular goiter (SMR = 2.4, 95% CI 1.2-4.3) and thyroid adenoma (SMR = 2.7, 95% CI 1.1-5.2). An increase in thyroid cancer risk was observed in women with thyroid adenoma (SMR = 11.7, 95% CI 1.3-42.1) but was based on only two deaths. In hyperthyroid women, statistically significant increases in the number of deaths were observed from pancreatic cancer (SMR = 2.6, 95% CI 1.4-4.3) and respiratory cancer (SMR = 2.2, 95% CI 1.3-3.5), but not breast cancer (SMR = 1.3, 95% CI 0.8-1.8). When the data were stratified by the time between the onset of thyroid symptoms and death, a nonsignificant excess number of cancer deaths was observed in hyperthyroid women who died 20 or more years after their symptoms began.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",
