        "content": "A retrospective follow-up study of 7338 women with either nontoxic nodular goiter, thyroid adenoma, hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, or no thyroid disease was conducted. All women patients at the Massachusetts General Hospital Thyroid Clinic who were seen between 1925 and 1974 and who were treated for a minimum of 1 year were traced. A total of 2231 women (30.4%) were dead and 2012 women (27.4%) were alive as of December 31, 1978. Partial follow-up information was available for the remaining 3095 women (42.2%). The average length of follow-up was 15.2 years. When losses to follow-up were withdrawn at the time of their loss, the standardized mortality ratios (SMR) for all causes of death were 1.2 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.1-1.3] for women with nontoxic nodular goiter, 1.2 (95% CI 1.0-1.3) for those with thyroid adenoma, 1.4 (95% CI 1.3-1.5) for women with hyperthyroidism, 1.5 (95% CI 1.3-1.7) for hypothyroid women, 1.2 (95% CI 0.9-1.5) for those with Hashimoto's thyroiditis, and 1.5 (95% CI 1.4-1.6) for those without thyroid disease. For deaths from all cancers, the standardized mortality ratios were 1.5 (95% CI 1.2-1.8) for women with nontoxic nodular goiter, 1.5 (95% CI 1.1-1.9) for those with thyroid adenoma, 1.2 (95% CI 1.0-1.4) for women with hyperthyroidism, 1.0 (95% CI 0.7-1.4) for the hypothyroid women, 1.2 (95% CI 0.7-2.1) for those with Hashimoto's thyroiditis, and 1.3 (95% CI 1.0-1.5) for those women without thyroid disease. When specific cancer sites were studied, excess numbers of deaths were observed from breast cancer in women with nontoxic nodular goiter (SMR = 1.6, 95% CI 1.0-2.6) and from lymphatic and hematopoietic cancer in women with nontoxic nodular goiter (SMR = 2.4, 95% CI 1.2-4.3) and thyroid adenoma (SMR = 2.7, 95% CI 1.1-5.2). An increase in thyroid cancer risk was observed in women with thyroid adenoma (SMR = 11.7, 95% CI 1.3-42.1) but was based on only two deaths. In hyperthyroid women, statistically significant increases in the number of deaths were observed from pancreatic cancer (SMR = 2.6, 95% CI 1.4-4.3) and respiratory cancer (SMR = 2.2, 95% CI 1.3-3.5), but not breast cancer (SMR = 1.3, 95% CI 0.8-1.8). When the data were stratified by the time between the onset of thyroid symptoms and death, a nonsignificant excess number of cancer deaths was observed in hyperthyroid women who died 20 or more years after their symptoms began.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

        "content": "The actuarial incidence and pattern of occurrence of shocks were analyzed in 65 patients after implantation of the automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator. During a mean follow-up of 25 +/- 21 months only one patient died suddenly, and this patient had a nonfunctioning device at the time of death. The long-term actuarial risk of death from any cause in the patients who received appropriate shocks was not significantly different than for the entire group. The 1- and 4-year cumulative risk of receiving any shock was 51 +/- 7% and 81 +/- 11%; of receiving an appropriate shock was 33 +/- 7% and 64 +/- 10%; of receiving a spurious shock was 17 +/- 5% and 21 +/- 6%; and of receiving an \"indeterminate\" shock was 19 +/- 6% and 52 +/- 10%. In 14 patients who were followed for 24 months without receiving an appropriate shock, the actuarial risk of receiving an appropriate shock was 29 +/- 14% during the next 24 months. The mean number of shocks delivered during appropriate episodes was 1.6 +/- 0.9, which was significantly lower than the mean of 4.0 +/- 2.0 shocks during spurious episodes (P less than 0.02). The mean number of shocks during indeterminate episodes was 1.7 +/- 1.5. Our data confirms the efficacy of the implantable defibrillator in preventing sudden death. The majority of patients with this device receive appropriate shocks during long-term follow-up, and the cumulative incidence of appropriate shocks increases steadily for at least 4 years. In contrast, the cumulative incidence of spurious shocks plateaus at about 12 months. Our data suggests that many \"indeterminate\" shocks actually appear to be appropriate.",

The risks did not depend on the type or generation of progestagen. Data analysis showed the risk of ischemic stroke or myocardial infarction increases with higher doses of estrogen. This risk was highest when pills had more than 50 μg of estrogen. Most preparations now contain less than 50 μg of estrogen, making COC substantially safer. COC pill containing 30 μg of estrogen and levonorgestrel is the safest oral form of combined oral contraceptive. [13]",

Expected mortality for the cohort was calculated using a years at risk calculation in 5 year bands. There was an excess risk of mortality from cancer of all sites (1.5-fold), stomach (1.6-fold), colorectum (1.7-fold), biliary tract (4.1-fold) and lung (1.6-fold). There was no excess risk or mortality from cancer of the oesophagus, pancreas and female breast. The numbers of deaths have been too few and length of follow-up too short to investigate latency. The findings are consistent with the production of carcinogens as a result of the hypoacidity following vagotomy.",
