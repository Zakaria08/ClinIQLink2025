By ID significantly more relevant and potentially hemolytic AB (51 vs. 35 AB/1.7 vs. 1.2%) could be detected: anti-E 4, -C 1, -D 4, -CW 2, -c 2, -Jk(a) 2, -Jk(b) 1. Eleven of these even remained negative in TT when retested with increased sensitivity and taking additional (homozygous) test cells. In addition, naturally occurring but rarely hemolytic AB (35 vs. 23 AB/1.2 vs. 0.8%) were more frequently detectable by ID: anti-Le(a) 6, -Le(b) 2, -P1 6. In contrast, only two AB were only positive in TT: anti-Le(a) 1, -Le(a, b) 1. The main disadvantage of the ID was its frequent positivity (7.7 vs. 4.3%) due to irrelevant cold AB (anti-I, -HI, -H) and unspecific factors. This can be partly reduced by omission of the bromelin test at room temperature (ID 3.0%, TT 1.5%) as the detection of relevant AB is not affected. The frequency of naturally occurring AB was still the same as in TT (0.7%) when bromelin at room temperature was omitted in both techniques. Further advantages of the ID are simplicity, small volumes of sera and reagents, and easy evaluation.",

Standard chick rations containing .8% Ca and .4 or .5% available P were fed as control diets in three experiments. Experimental diets contained .05, .1, or .3% Al, or 1.0 or 1.5% niacin, or both and were fed for 2 wk. Tibia weights were decreased by 1.5% niacin, .3% Al, and by .1% Al plus 1.5% niacin (P less than .05). Breaking strength of tibiae was decreased (P less than .05) by 1.5% niacin, .1% Al, and .1% Al plus 1.5% niacin. Ultimate stress, which is force per unit area, was decreased by .3% Al and .05% Al plus 1.5% niacin (P less than .05). Niacin had no significant effect on bone mineral content. In Experiment 3, .3% Al decreased P, Ca, Mg, and Zn content of the tibiae (P less than .05). These findings indicate that feeding high levels of supplemental niacin results in decreased bone strength in chicks with no change in mineral content of the tibiae. Aluminum fed at levels of .3% of the diet causes a decrease in bone strength with concomitant changes in bone mineral content.",

In contrast, only two AB were only positive in T: anti-Le (a) 1, anti-Le (ab) 1. The main disadvantage of ID was its frequent positivity (7.7 vs. 4.3%) due to irrelevant cold AB (anti-I, anti-HI, anti-H) and unspecific factors. This can be partly reduced by omission of the bromelin test at room temperature (ID 3.0%, T 1.5%) as the detection of relevant AB is not affected. The frequency of naturally occurring AB was still the same as in T (0.7%) when bromelin at room temperature was omitted in both techniques.

Subjects (n = 5) underwent blood sampling at 10-min intervals for 6 h before and on days 2, 5, and 8 of glucocorticoid treatment, and for 24 h (n = 6) to examine pulsatile LH and GH release before and during dexamethasone administration (1.5 mg orally twice daily for 1 week). In the time-course study, we found significant decreases on day 8 in serum concentrations of estradiol (from 144 +/- 18 to 99 +/- 18 pmol/L), free testosterone (from 105 +/- 10 to 87 +/- 10 pmol/L), and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (from 6.0 +/- 1.6 to 1.7 +/- 0.3 mumol/L; P less than 0.05). Mean serum LH concentrations did not change (baseline, 5.3 +/- 1.2 IU/L; glucocorticoid, 4.2 +/- 0.61 IU/L). The mean plasma somatomedin-C concentration rose from 0.74 +/- 0.08 to 2.0 +/- 0.35 U/mL (P less than 0.05), and the mean serum GH concentration increased from 1.2 +/- 0.90 micrograms/L (basal) to 4.2 +/- 1.5 micrograms/L (day 8 of dexamethasone; P less than 0.01). Deconvolution analysis of 24-h serum GH and LH concentration profiles revealed that the half-life of endogenous GH and the duration and amplitude (maximal rate of secretion) of computer-resolved GH secretory bursts were not influenced significantly by dexamethasone. The mass of GH secreted per burst rose 1.6-fold. Glucocorticoid treatment also increased detectable GH secretory burst frequency from 12 +/- 1.6 to 18 +/- 1.6 episodes/24 h, decreased the GH interburst interval from 127 +/- 23 to 79 +/- 5 min, and increased the daily GH secretion rate from 41 +/- 11 to 101 +/- 11 micrograms/L.day. These effects on the somatotropic axis were specific, since the half-life of LH; LH secretory burst frequency, amplitude, mass, and duration; and the total daily LH production rate (and LH secretion in response to exogenous GnRH) were not altered by dexamethasone administration. We conclude that short term moderate glucocorticoid excess augments pulsatile GH secretion without influencing the episodic release of LH in normal men.",
