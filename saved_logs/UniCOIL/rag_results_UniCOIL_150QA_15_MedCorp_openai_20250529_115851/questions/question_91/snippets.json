        "content": "1. We have investigated the mechanism of a directional deficit in vertical pursuit eye movements in a monkey that was unable to match upward eye speed to target speed but that had pursuit within the normal range for downward or horizontal target motion. Except for a difference in the axis of deficient pursuit, the symptoms in this monkey were similar to those seen with lesions in the frontal or parietal lobes of the cerebral cortex in humans or monkeys. Our evaluation of vertical pursuit in this monkey suggests a new interpretation for the role of the frontal and parietal lobes in pursuit. 2. The up/down asymmetry was most pronounced for target motion at speeds greater than or equal to 2 degree/s. For target motion at 15 or 30 degree/s, upward step-ramp target motion evoked a brief upward smooth eye acceleration, followed by tracking that consisted largely of saccades. Downward step-ramp target motion evoked a prolonged smooth eye acceleration, followed by smooth, accurate tracking. 3. Varying the amplitude of the target step revealed that the deficit was similar for targets moving across all locations of the visual field. Eye acceleration in the interval 0-20 ms after the onset of pursuit was independent of initial target position and was symmetrical for upward and downward target motion. Eye acceleration in the interval 60-80 ms after the onset of pursuit showed a large asymmetry. For upward target motion, eye acceleration in this interval was small and did not depend on initial target position. For downward target motion, eye acceleration depended strongly on initial target position and was large when the target started close to the position of fixation. 4. We next attempted to understand the mechanism of the up/down asymmetry by evaluating the monkey's vertical motion processing and vertical eye movements under a variety of tracking conditions. For spot targets, the response to upward image motion was similar to that in normal monkeys if the image motion was presented during downward pursuit. In addition, the monkey with deficient upward pursuit was able to use upward image motion to make accurate saccades to moving targets. We conclude that the visual processing of upward image motion was normal in this monkey and that an asymmetry in visual motion processing could not account for the deficit in his upward pursuit. 5. Upward smooth eye acceleration was normal when the spot target was moved together with a large textured pattern.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

        "content": "When a person walks through a rigid environment while holding eyes and head fixed, the pattern of retinal motion flows radially away from a point, the focus of expansion (Fig. 1a). Under such conditions of translation, heading corresponds to the focus of expansion and people identify it readily. But when making an eye/head movement to track an object off to the side, retinal motion is no longer radial (Fig. 1b). Heading perception in such situations has been modelled in two ways. Extra-retinal models monitor the velocity of rotational movements through proprioceptive or efference information from the extraocular and neck muscles and use that information to discount rotation effects. Retinal-image models determine (and eliminate) rotational components from the retinal image alone. These models have been tested by measuring heading perception under two conditions. First, observers judged heading while tracking a point on a simulated ground plane. Second, they fixated a stationary point and the flow field simulated the effects of a tracking eye movement. Extra-retinal models predict poorer performance in the simulated condition because the eyes do not move. Retinal-image models predict no difference in performance because the two conditions produce identical patterns of retinal motion. Warren and Hannon observed similar performance and concluded that people do not require extra-retinal information to judge heading with eye/head movements present, but they used extremely slow tracking eye movements of 0.2-1.2 deg s-1; a moving observer frequently tracks objects at much higher rates (L. Stark, personal communication). Here we examine heading judgements at higher, more typical eye movement velocities and find that people require extra-retinal information about eye position to perceive heading accurately under many viewing conditions.",

Whereas the VOR is activated only by head motion, the OKR is activated by movement of the visual scene, whether caused by motion of the scene itself or by head motion. Specifically, the sensory stimulus for this reflex is slip of the visual scene on the retina as detected by motion-sensitive retinal ganglion cells. An example of the former occurs when you are sitting in a train and a train on the adjacent track begins moving: Your eyes rotate to keep the image of the neighboring car stable. This often leads to a sensation that you are moving (this is not entirely surprising because OKR circuits feed into the same circuits as used by the vestibular system).",
