No significant differences were found. This finding was in direct contrast to our earlier study of obstetric patients where overall savings were achieved.

Most of the savings for this group was achieved through a reduction in the cost of routine services, which includes nursing care. If the current nursing shortage leads to an increase in co-op units, nursing administrators need to be aware that potential cost savings may depend on physician familiarity with the co-op concept.
