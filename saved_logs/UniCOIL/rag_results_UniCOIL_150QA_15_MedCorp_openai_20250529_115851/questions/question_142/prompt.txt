Document 1 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Unburned cured tobacco used orally contains nicotine, carcinogens, and other toxicants capable of causing gum disease, oral and pancreatic cancers, and an increase in the risk of heart disease. When tobacco is burned, the resultant smoke contains, in addition to nicotine, more than 7000 other compounds that result from volatilization, pyrolysis, and pyrosynthesis of tobacco and various chemical additives used in making different tobacco products. The smoke is composed of a fine aerosol and a vapor phase; aerosolized particles are of a size range that results in deposition in the airways and alveolar surfaces of the lungs.

Document 3 (Title: Ontogeny of protein phosphatases 1 and 2A in developing rat lung.): Protein phosphatase (PP) 1 and 2A activities were measured in soluble and particulate fractions of rat lung homogenates, obtained from 18- to 22-day gestation fetal rats, from neonates, and from adults. PP 1 activity in the particulate fraction increased 7-fold from 15 +/- 2 to 102 +/- 12 (mean +/- SD) U/g lung between 18 and 22 days gestation, increased a further 1.5-fold to 152 +/- 18 U/g in newborns, with no further increase in adults. PP 2A activity in the particulate fraction increased 3-fold from 10 +/- 2 to 32 +/- 5 U/g between 21 and 22 days gestation and did not change postnatally. PP 1 activity in the soluble fraction increased 7.8-fold from 4 +/- 2 to 31 +/- 4 U/g lung between 18 and 22 days gestation, increased a further 1.8-fold in newborns to 54 +/- 8 U/g lung and increased 1.5-fold to 81 +/- 6 U/g lung in adults. PP 2A activity in the soluble fraction increased 2.2-fold from 12 +/- 4 to 28 +/- 8 U/g lung between 18 and 22 days gestation, increased a further 1.7-fold in newborns to 47 +/- 9 U/g ...
