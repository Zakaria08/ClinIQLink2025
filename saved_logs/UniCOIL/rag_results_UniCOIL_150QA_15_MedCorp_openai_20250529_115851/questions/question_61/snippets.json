Patients on UFH should be monitored to maintain an aPTT in the therapeutic range of 1.5 to 2.5 times the control 6 hours after the injection. Anticoagulation with LMWH can be monitored by following anti-factor Xa levels. However, the need to monitor these patients remains uncertain. For those on weight-based therapeutic doses, studies in which anti-factor Xa levels have been monitored with a goal of 0.6 to 1.0 units/mL, show that few patients will require dosing adjustments beyond those they would already receive as their weight naturally increases during pregnancy. The decision to monitor patients on therapeutic LMWH should, therefore, be based on institutional protocols and clinical judgment. Additionally, optimal anti-factor Xa levels have not been determined for patients receiving prophylactic LMWH, so patients on prophylactic doses rarely require regular monitoring. Finally, close attention should be given to routine laboratory tests, including platelet counts, to detect any signs of adverse effects of the anticoagulants (eg, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia).

This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a topical NSAID, biphenylacetic acid 3% gel (Traxam) in the treatment of soft tissue trauma. Thirty-two patients (22 males and 10 females) with acute soft tissue trauma were enrolled at the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, National University Hospital, Singapore from 7 June 1988 to 28 March 1989.

Fasciculations were recorded using a graded visual scale. Of 46 patients, eight of 19 (42%) in the pancuronium group and six of 27 (22%) in the succinylcholine group experienced fasciculations. No statistically significant difference in fasciculations was detected between the two groups using chi 2 analysis. Complete relaxation of the cords was present in all but two patients, one in each group. No patient in either group experienced emesis or significant dysrhythmias. Pretreatment with minidose succinylcholine causes no greater incidence of fasciculations than pancuronium in rapid-sequence intubation of head trauma patients in an ED setting.
