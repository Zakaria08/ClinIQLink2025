Document 2 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Unburned cured tobacco used orally contains nicotine, carcinogens, and other toxicants capable of causing gum disease, oral and pancreatic cancers, and an increase in the risk of heart disease. When tobacco is burned, the resultant smoke contains, in addition to nicotine, more than 7000 other compounds that result from volatilization, pyrolysis, and pyrosynthesis of tobacco and various chemical additives used in making different tobacco products. The smoke is composed of a fine aerosol and a vapor phase; aerosolized particles are of a size range that results in deposition in the airways and alveolar surfaces of the lungs.

Document 3 (Title: Development of benzodiazepine and picrotoxin (t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate) binding sites in rat cerebellar granule cells in culture.): The specific bindings of [3H]flunitrazepam [( 3H]FLU), [3H]CGS 8216, and t-[35S]butylbicyclophosphorothionate [( 35S]TBPS) to sites on rat cerebellar granule cells all increase from 4 to 15 days in culture, although their time courses differ. Specific [3H]FLU binding doubles, [3H]CGS 8216 binding triples, and [35S]TBPS binding increases about fourfold from 4 to 15 days in culture. Displacement studies, using the type I-selective ligand CL 218,872, indicate that at 4 days the [3H]FLU binding sites are almost entirely "type II," judging from an IC50 value near 300 nM and a pseudo-Hill number near 1. By 10 days, approximately equal numbers of type I and type II binding sites are present in the cultured cells, and this ratio remains constant thereafter (12 and 15 days). At days 10-15, both the IC50 value for CL 218,872 (near 100 nM) and the pseudo-Hill number (near 0.7) remain constant and are significantly different from the values at culture day 4. The development of specific [35S]TBPS binding parallels that of...

Document 5 (Title: Lipoprotein Lipase Deficiency -- Pathophysiology): p.D9N, located in exon 2, is a less common variant found in 1.6% to 4.4% of the population. Homozygous individuals for this variant exhibit a 20% reduction in LPL activity. [13] c.644G>A, located in exon 5, was previously documented as p.188G>E and is currently updated to p.215G>E. This occurs in 0.06% of the population. [14] This single nucleotide variant (SNV) is most frequently associated with homozygous chylomicronemia, particularly among French Canadians in Quebec. Additionally, this SNV is strongly linked to an increased risk of coronary artery disease. [14] A221-del (c.916delG), located in exon 5, results in homozygous chylomicronemia, and it is the most common mutation identified in the Japanese population. This mutation is also referred to as LPL Arita. [15] Carriers of the p.291N>S mutation or the combined mutation p.9D>N/93T>G are known to have an increased risk of preeclampsia. [16]

Question: Select the correct statement(s) regarding fluorescence spectroscopy:
Options:
1. Fluorescent molecules most often present delocalized electron systems
2. A metal ion never exhibits fluorescence properties
3. Groups that increase electron delocalization increase the fluorescence of the compound
4. The rigidity of a molecule increases the fluorescence yield
5. Quantitative assays are not possible
