        "title": "Influence of gonadal hormones and sexual behavior on ultrasonic vocalization in rats: I. Treatment of females.",
        "content": "Ultrasonic vocalizations were measured when male rats were placed with ovariectomized females that had experienced various hormonal and behavioral treatments. In Experiment 1, 18 males were tested with females in each of the following conditions: nonestrous (OVX), estrogen treated (E), estrogen and progesterone treated (EP), and estrogen and progesterone treated and given two intromissions from a stud male prior to testing (EPI). Control conditions included clean cage (CL) and cage soiled by an estrous female (SOI). The treatments differed in effect on rate and maintenance of vocalization: EP greater than E greater than EPI = OVX greater than SOI greater than CL. In tests in which males produced a high rate of vocalization, some males with short intromission latencies shifted from the normal 50-kHz pulse to a 22-kHz pulse. In Experiment 2, the effect of the female's vocalization and movement on the rate of and latency to vocalization was measured. Twenty-one males were presented with each of the following stimulus conditions: estrous female with red light (EP), estrous female without red light (EP dark), estrous anesthetized female (EP anes), and nonestrous anesthetized female (OVX anes). Effects on vocalization of various treatments were as follows: EP = EP dark greater than EP anes greater than OVX anes. These data suggest that the 50-kHz vocalizations constitute a graded response influenced by the female's hormonal and sexual condition.",

        "content": "Larynx, monkey, H&E ×15. The vocal folds are ridge-like structures that are oriented in an anteroposterior (ventral-dorsal) direction. In frontal sections, the vocal folds (VF ) are cross-sectioned, giving the appearance seen here. The two vocal folds and the space between them constitute the glottis. Just above each vocal fold is an elongated recess called the ventricle (V ), and above the ventricle is another ridge called the ventricular fold (VnF ) or, sometimes, the false vocal fold. Below and lateral to the vocal folds are the vocalis muscles (VM ). Within the vocal fold is a considerable amount of elastic material, although it is usually not evident in routine H&E preparations. This elastic material is part of the vocal ligament. It lies in an anteroposterior direction within the substance of the vocal fold and plays an important role in phonation.",

If G and H are both path-connected and locally path-connected, then for any choice of element e* in the fiber over e ∈ H, there exists a unique topological group structure on G, with e* as the identity, for which the covering map p : G → H is a homomorphism. The construction is as follows. Let a and b be elements of G and let f and g be paths in G starting at e* and terminating at a and b respectively. Define a path h : I → H by h(t) = p(f(t))p(g(t)). By the path-lifting property of covering spaces there is a unique lift of h to G with initial point e*. The product ab is defined as the endpoint of this path. By construction we have p(ab) = p(a)p(b). One must show that this definition is independent of the choice of paths f and g, and also that the group operations are continuous.",
