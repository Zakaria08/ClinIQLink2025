Document 1 (Title: PMCs--an alternative to DRGs for trauma care reimbursement.): Payments made for inpatient trauma care were compared using two different patient classification systems--Patient Management Categories (PMCs) and Diagnosis Related Groups (DRGs). Two databases were used in this study: 1) estimated costs for all inpatient claims from one large payor for adult injured patients (n = 5,256) treated at 79 acute care facilities (trauma centers and non-trauma centers) in one geographic region; and 2) hospital charges from statewide, all-payor Maryland data, including 25,987 adult injured patients. The accuracy of PMCs and DRGs in predicting actual costs was examined by level of injury severity and by types of hospital, trauma center vs. non-trauma center. Level of injury (minor, single significant, multiple significant, and major) were defined and operationalized using PMCs. Overall, both DRG and PMC payment systems were nearly equal to the actual costs associated with all injured patients. This relationship can be designed into the weighting scale used for payment. The distributio...
Document 2 (Title: Disaster medicine): Medical contingency planning – The act of devising a methodology for meeting the medical requirements of a population affected by a disaster event. Medical surge – An influx of patients (physical casualties and psychological casualties), bystanders, visitors, family members, media and individuals searching for the missing who present to a hospital or healthcare facility for treatment, information and/or shelter as a result of a disaster. Surge capacity – The ability to manage a sudden, unexpected increase in patient volume that would otherwise severely challenge or exceed the current capacity of the health care system. Medical triage – The separation of patients based on severity of injury or illness in light of available resources. Psychosocial triage – The separation of patients based on the severity of psychological injury or impact in light of available resources.
Document 3 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Doxorubicin can intercalate into DNA, thereby altering DNA structure, replication, and topoisomerase II function. It can also undergo reduction reactions by accepting electrons into its quinone ring system, with the capacity to undergo reoxidation to form reactive oxygen radicals after reoxidation. It causes predictable myelosuppression, alopecia, nausea, and mucositis. In addition, it causes acute cardiotoxicity in the form of atrial and ventricular dysrhythmias, but these are rarely of clinical significance. In contrast, cumulative doses >550 mg/m2 are associated with a 10% incidence of chronic cardiomyopathy. The incidence of cardiomyopathy appears to be related to schedule (peak serum concentration), with low-dose, frequent treatment or continuous infusions better tolerated than intermittent higher-dose exposures. Cardiotoxicity has been related to iron-catalyzed oxidation and reduction of doxorubicin, and not to topoisomerase action. Cardiotoxicity is related to peak plasma dose;
Document 4 (Title: EMS Terrorism Response -- Clinical Significance): Command, control, and communication require emphasis. EMS, as well as hospital administrators, should be included as it is essential to anticipate surge capacity. The inclusion of all local hospitals is vital in contingency plans as the number of severely injured patients may become overwhelming even for a level 1 trauma center. [18]
Document 5 (Title: Obstentrics_Williams): Traumatic injuries to nerves can be serious and distressing, especially if permanent. Injury can involve a single nerve, or it can afect a nerve root, plexus, or trunk (Volpe, 1995). Injuries to the brachial plexus are relatively common. hey are identiied in 1 to 3 per 1000 term births (Baskett, 2007; Lindqvist, 2012; Wall, 2014). In the study reported by Moczygemba and colleagues (2010), the incidence of brachial nerve injury was 1.5 per 1000 vaginal deliveries and 0.17 per 1000 cesarean deliveries. he incidence among 366,408 neonates born at Parkland Hospital was 3.5 per 1000 births (Wall, 2014). Breech delivery and shoulder dystocia are risks for this trauma. However, severe plexopathy may also occur without risk factors (Torki, 2012).
