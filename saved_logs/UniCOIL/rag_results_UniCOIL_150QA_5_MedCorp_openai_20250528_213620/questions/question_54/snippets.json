On the way they fall into a cave trying to escape from an anaconda. Cole gets lost and panics after finding a skeleton. He runs into Bill's partner, Tran, and as they return to the others, Tran gets pulled under and Cole tries to find him, however, Tran is eaten. Bill tries to find Cole and Tran, but also notices Tran's lost flashlight floating with his blood surrounding it. The terrified Cole escapes from the caves behind the group, seconds ahead of the snake, which follows him through the hole and gets stuck. Sam uses a machete to behead it, but another snake captures Cole. The team follows and find him being constricted, but still alive. Bill throws his knife and impales the snake through the head, killing it and freeing Cole.",

        "content": "The \"pull\" technique is most commonly used and was initially introduced by Gauderer et al. A string is attached to a needle and inserted via the abdominal wall into the stomach. It is grasped with endoscopic biopsy forceps or a snare, and then the endoscope is retracted, taking out the string through the esophagus and mouth. Then the string is attached to the external end of the PEG tube, and the string is pulled back through the abdominal wall. This results in pulling the tube from the mouth to the esophagus, the stomach, and then outside the body through the abdominal wall. [9]",

        "content": "To determine the relationship between lower esophageal sphincter (LES) intraluminal pressure and its intraluminal pH, we studied six healthy volunteers. We recorded intraluminal pressure and pH concurrently using rapid pull-through, slow pull-through, and station pull-through, as well as, rapid push-through and slow push-through techniques. The results showed that LES length was 35 +/- 4 (SE) mm by RPT and 30 +/- 3 mm by SPT. The pressure was maximal in the proximal half of the LES. On rapid pull-throughs, the intraluminal pH rose from about 1.5 to reach a value of about 2.5 at the peak of the high pressure zone. With continued withdrawal into the esophageal body, the recorded pH rose minimally to about 3-4. On push-throughs, the pH recorded along the LES was the same as that of the esophageal body. After the electrode cleared the LES, the pH abruptly fell to gastric pH. During station pull-through with the electrode 0.5-1.5 cm proximal to the distal LES margin, transient pH drops were observed with swallows. With rapid swallows, however, the pH drop did not occur until after the last swallow. This finding suggests that the pH drops with swallows were due to axial LES movement rather than gastroesophageal acid reflux. We conclude that 1) the relationship of the gastroesophageal pH transition zone and LES high pressure zone is better defined by a sphincter push-through than a pull-through; 2) the transition between gastric and esophageal pH occurs either at or slightly distal to the distal LES margin; and 3) swallow-induced axial LES movement may cause spurious recording of acid reflux when the pH probe is positioned within the distal half of the LES.",

Anorectal malformations describe a spectrum of congenital anomalies that include imperforate anus and persistent cloaca.
