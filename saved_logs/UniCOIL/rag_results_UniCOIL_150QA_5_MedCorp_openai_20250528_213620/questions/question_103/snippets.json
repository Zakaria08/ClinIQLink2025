        "title": "Acetyl phosphate as a substrate for the calcium ATPase of sarcoplasmic reticulum.",
        "content": "Acetyl phosphate is hydrolyzed by the calcium ATPase of leaky sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles from rabbit skeletal muscle with Km = 6.5 mM and kcat = 7.9 s-1 in the presence of 100 microM calcium (180 mM K+, 5 mM MgSO4, pH 7.0, 25 degrees C). In the absence of calcium, hydrolysis is 6% of the calcium-dependent rate at low and 24% at saturating concentrations of acetyl phosphate. Values of K0.5 for calcium are 3.5 and 2.2 microM (n = 1.6) in the presence of 1 and 50 mM acetyl phosphate, respectively; inhibition by calcium follows K0.5 = 1.6 mM (n approximately 1.1) with 50 mM acetyl phosphate and K0.5 = 0.5 mM (n approximately 1.3) with 1.5 mM ATP. The calcium-dependent rate of phosphoenzyme formation from acetyl phosphate is consistent with Km = 43 mM and kf = 32 s-1 at saturation; decomposition of the phosphoenzyme occurs with kt = 16 s-1. The maximum fraction of phosphoenzyme formed in the steady state at saturating acetyl phosphate concentrations is 43-46%. These results are consistent with kc congruent to 30 s-1 for binding of Ca2+ to E at saturating [Ca2+], to give cE.Ca2, in the absence of activation by ATP. Phosphoenzyme formed from ATP and from acetyl phosphate shows the same biphasic reaction with ADP, rate constants for decomposition that are the same within experimental error, and similar or identical activation of decomposition by ATP. It is concluded that the reaction pathways for acetyl phosphate and ATP in the presence of Ca2+ are the same, with the exception of calcium binding and phosphorylation; an alternative, faster route that avoids the kc step is available in the presence of ATP. The existence of three different regions of dependence on ATP concentration for steady state turnover is confirmed; activation of hydrolysis at high ATP concentrations involves an ATP-induced increase in kt.",
