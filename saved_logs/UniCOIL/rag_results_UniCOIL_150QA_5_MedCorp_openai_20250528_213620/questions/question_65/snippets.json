To improve the look and feeling of the skin, patients can apply a cream containing alpha hydroxy acids, glycerol and urea, and if necessary, patients can use antibiotics to control secondary infections. Pachyonychia congenita There is no radical therapeutic method for pachyonychia congenita, but some care can ease the symptoms. Patients can polish and trim thickened nails, some of them can use retinoids to relieve symptoms but it may increase pain. Neurofibromatosis type I Selumetinib and trametinib have been shown to reduce and control tumor growth in people with neurofibromatosis type I, reducing the likelihood of malignant lesions. Therapeutic methods There are some new and developing genetic therapies available in genodermatosis.",

        "content": "There is a concept of a direct immune response to medications and drugs or even biologic therapies that use proteins to stimulate a response. This concept involves the pharmacological interaction of drugs with immune receptors known as the p-i concept). The theory is that certain drugs in their naive state without processing or metabolism can stimulate T cells through T cell receptors (TCRs) or HLA molecules that are not their primary therapeutic targets. This stimulation is called “off-target” activity and explains genetic propensity through TCRs and HLA of individuals. A specific example is drugs that produce a drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms/drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome. (DRESS/DiHS) such as flucloxacillin and sulfamethoxazole). The mechanisms of p-i TCR and p-i HLA are different, but the concept is direct off-target induction of the immune system is the concept. In the p-i TCR model, a drug interacts with a TCR. Then a second interaction between the TCR and HLA molecules on APCs is required to stimulate a cellular proliferation, cytokine production, and cytotoxicity by the drug stimulated T Cells. Sulfamethoxazole, as an example, is a common public epitope, but another factor is required to induce it, such as a generalized viral infection. [12] [13] [14] [15]",

        "content": "The cost of gynecologic care delivered in a cooperative care (co-op) unit was compared with the cost for similar patients treated in a traditional hospital inpatient unit. No significant differences were found. This finding was in direct contrast to our earlier study of obstetric patients where overall savings were achieved. The authors did, however, find cost savings (approximately $450) for those co-op patients cared for by physicians who were frequent users of the unit. Most of the savings for this group was achieved through a reduction in the cost of routine services, which includes nursing care. If the current nursing shortage leads to an increase in co-op units, nursing administrators need to be aware that potential cost savings may depend on physician familiarity with the co-op concept. A major role of nursing therefore, is to provide information on the benefits of cooperative care both to physicians and to potential patients.",

With the exception of one fatality, using an unchanged intensive care therapy program, 7 patients were successfully treated with the new concept. Since the results obtained with the therapeutic concept used prior to the technique of programmed lavage, as also reports in the international literature, are associated with a very poor prognosis, it is suggested that this new treatment concept be employed with the aim of improving the prognosis. A definitive assessment of this concept will, however, require a large number of cases treated in this way.",
