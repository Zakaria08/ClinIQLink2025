        "content": "PI animals recognise intra-cellular BVD viral particles as ‘self’ and shed virus in large quantities throughout life; they represent the cornerstone of the success of BVD as a disease. Currently, it was shown in a worldwide review study that the PI prevalence at animal level ranged from low (≤0.8% Europe, North America, Australia), medium (>0.8% to 1.6% East Asia) to high (>1.6% West Asia). Countries that had failed to implement any BVDV control and/or eradication programmes (including vaccination) had the highest PI prevalence. Virus classification and structure BVDVs are members of the genus Pestivirus, belonging to the family Flaviviridae. Other members of this genus cause Border disease (sheep) and classical swine fever (pigs) which cause significant financial loss to the livestock industry. Pestiviruses are small, spherical, single-stranded, enveloped RNA viruses of 40 to 60 nm in diameter.",

        "content": "To determine the prevalence of hepatitis B and C viruses, and human immunodeficiency virus infections in women of reproductive age attending a health care system. Prospective cross-sectional study. Public Obstetric Clinic and Service for Pre- and Perinatal Prevention of Infectious Diseases, Rome, Latium Region, Italy. 1142 women attending our centres consecutively for delivery, miscarriage, voluntary interruption of pregnancy or screening for pre- and perinatal prevention of infectious diseases. Serum samples, collected after informed consent over a period of 2 months, were tested for hepatitis B virus markers (anti-HBc and HBsAg) by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), for antibodies against hepatitis C virus (by ELISA and, if positive, by RIBA) and for human immunodeficiency virus antibodies (by ELISA and, if positive by Western blot). The seroprevalence of hepatitis B virus was 14.4% (95% CI Poisson distribution 12.2-16.5) for anti-HBc and 1.6% (95% CI, 0.9-2.5) for HBsAg. Antibodies against hepatitis C virus were detected by ELISA in 2.4% (CI 1.6-3.5) and by first generation RIBA in 0.9% (CI 0.4-1.6). Human immunodeficiency virus seroprevalence was 1.0% (CI 0.5-1.7). No significant differences were observed by age or by reason for attending. Women attending our centres have a higher prevalence of hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus and human immunodeficiency virus infection than those observed in our country in larger national surveys of newborn babies, in reproductive-aged women or in other selected low-risk groups such as blood donors. This could be due to the attendance of women at increased risk such as drug addicts. The information has the additional value of emphasizing the need for adherence by health care personnel, to the recommendations issued for the prevention of occupational infections.",

        "content": "HIV infection does not immediately cause AIDS. Without treatment, the average time to development of AIDS following infection of adults is several years. The long delay between infection and development of symptomatic immune deficiency reflects the unusual tropism of the virus for CD4 T cells of the immune system, as well as the nature of the immune response to the virus. HIV is now pandemic, and despite great strides in treatment and prevention that have followed from a greater understanding of the pathogenesis and epidemiology of the disease, 1.6 million people died of AIDSrelated causes in 2012 and an estimated 35.3 million are infected by HIV worldwide, presaging the death of many from AIDS for years to come (Fig. 13.28). In subSaharan Africa, which accounts for over twothirds of the global incidence, 1 in every 20 adults is infected. Indeed, HIV/AIDS has emerged as the most deadly single infectious agent in the short time since its identification as a new human pathogen.",
