        "content": "The organisms that cause traveler’s diarrhea vary considerably with location (Table 160-3), as does the pattern of antimicrobial resistance. In all areas, enterotoxigenic and enteroaggregative strains of E. coli are the most common isolates from persons with the classic secretory traveler’s diarrhea syndrome. Infection with Campylobacter jejuni is especially common in areas of Asia. Closed and semi-closed communities, including day-care centers, schools, residential facilities, and cruise ships, are important settings for outbreaks of enteric infections. Norovirus, which is highly contagious and robust in surviving on surfaces, is the most common etiologic agent associated with outbreaks of acute gastroenteritis. Other common organisms, often spread by fecal-oral contact in such communities, are Shigella,",

        "content": "Surgical repair of uretero-enteric strictures in patients with enteric conduit urinary diversion (incidence rate 4-8%) is difficult and has a high morbidity. With the development of endo-urologic techniques and ureteral catheters, long-term insertion of stents in the treatment of strictures has become possible and safe. We have performed long-term uretero-enteric stenting with 7-8 Fr double-J catheters in 5 patients with 6 strictures: 3 ureteroileal and 3 uretero-colic. In three cases (2 colonic conduits, 1 ileal conduit) the stent was inserted anterogradely following intercostal renal percutaneous punctures and dilatation of the stricture with teflon dilators (1 case), balloon catheter (1 case), or following the incision of the stricture (1 case). In one patient with a double uretero-enteric stricture of the ileal conduit, guide-wires were successfully inserted retrogradely which permitted subsequent high pressure dilatation of the uretero-ileal strictures with a 15 Fr balloon catheter. We used the same approach in another patient with a right uretero-colic stricture. The catheters were left indwelling for 7 to 35 months and were changed every 3 months with no remarkable observations other than 3 episodes of fever which quickly resolved with antibiotic treatment. Although is has been reported that uretero-enteric strictures are particularly refractory to endo-urologic treatment and a significant morbidity rate has been associated with long-term ureteral stenting, our results show that the approach was well-tolerated by all of the patients.",

The second nurse verification measure was retained, with the second nurse instructed to double-check all doses, pump settings, drug names, and concentrations before administration of any drugs. Moreover, the RCA recommended that all medication orders be provided in writing and entered in the electronic medical record using computerized provider order entry (CPOE) systems, regardless of the situation's urgency, to avoid dosing errors. The RCA team emphasized that verbal communication for medication administration should always be avoided. If verbal communication is necessary or unavoidable, the RCA recommended that the nurse taking the order read back the order given to the prescribing physician to minimize any prescribing errors.",
