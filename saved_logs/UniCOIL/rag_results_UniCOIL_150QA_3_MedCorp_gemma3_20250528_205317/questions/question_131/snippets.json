        "title": "Molecular characterization of the human platelet integrin GPIIb/IIIa and its constituent glycoproteins.",
        "content": "Human platelet plasma membrane glycoproteins IIb (GPIIb) and IIIa (GPIIIa) form a Ca(2+)-dependent heterodimer, the integrin GPIIb/IIIa, which serves as the receptor for fibrinogen and other adhesive proteins at the surface of activated platelets. Below the critical micellar concentration of Triton X100 (TtX), the three glycoproteins do not bind appreciably to TtX and form association products of large size. The size-exclusion chromatographic patterns of GPIIb, GPIIIa and GPIIb/IIIa have been obtained at 0.2% TtX, and the molecular properties of the association products and monomer fractions have been determined by analysis of the detergent bound to the glycoproteins, laser-light scattering, sedimentation velocity, and electron microscopy (TEM). The monomer of the GPIIb-TtX complex was identified by the molecular mass (M) of the glycoprotein moiety (125 +/- 15 kDa), the molecular size (9.5 +/- 1.5 nm x 11 +/- 1.5 nm) and globular shape observed by TEM. It has a molecular mass (M*) of 197 +/- 20 kDa, a sedimentation coefficient s degrees 20* of 5.8 +/- 0.1 S, a Stokes radius R s* of 6.8 +/- 0.4 nm, and a frictional ratio f*/fmin* of 1.7 +/- 0.14. The (GPIIb)n-TtX complexes are disulphide-bonded size-heterogeneous association products of GPIIb, tetramers being the smallest species found. GPIIIa has a greater propensity to self-associate than GPIIb, this tendency being lower below 1 mg GPIIIa/ml, 0.1 mM Ca2+, pH 9.0. The (GPIIIa)n-TtX complexes are noncovalent size-heterogeneous association products of GPIIIa, tetramers being the smallest form observed. The monomer of the GPIIIa-TtX complex was identified by the 103 +/- 15 kDa M determined for the glycoprotein moiety, and the 9 +/- 1.5 nm x 10 +/- 1.5 nm size and globular shape observed by TEM. It has a M* of 136 +/- 15 kDa, a s degrees 20* of 3.9 +/- 0.3 S, a Rs* of 6.4 +/- 0.5 nm, a f*/fmin* of 1.9 +/- 0.3, and, when stored at pH 7.4, has a certain tendency to form filamentous association products (20-70 nm x 2-5 nm), as observed by TEM. The GPIIb/IIIa-TtX complex in 0.2% TtX/0.1 mM Ca2+ elutes as a single monomeric fraction, as deduced from the 210 +/- 15 kDa M determined for its glycoprotein moiety and the 12 +/- 1.5 nm x 14 +/- 1.5 nm size of the globular forms observed by TEM.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

        "content": "Facelift The facelifted third generation Myvi was launched on 18 November 2021. The Perodua Smart Drive Assist (PSDA), also known as ASA 3.0, replaces the ASA 2.0 in the outgoing pre-facelift Myvi and it is standard on all variants except for the base 1.3 G. There are 5 variants on offer. The 1.3-litre engine option now consists of only 2 variants, the base 1.3 G, and 1.3 G with PSDA, while the 1.5-litre engine option now consists of the 1.5 X, 1.5 H and 1.5 AV variants. The 4-speed automatic that has been in use since the first generation Myvi has been replaced by a D-CVT that is also found in the Perodua Ativa. The D-CVT is the only transmission option. The 5-speed manual transmission that was previously offered only on 1.3-litre variants was dropped due to low sales of only 1 percent. 1.5 AV variant gets new features including adaptive cruise control, blind spot monitoring, rear cross traffic alert and lane departure warning with lane departure prevention.",
