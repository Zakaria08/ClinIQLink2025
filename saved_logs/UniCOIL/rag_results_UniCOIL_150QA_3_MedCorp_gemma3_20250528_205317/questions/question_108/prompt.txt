Document 2 (Title: Platinum complexes inhibit repair of potentially lethal damage following bleomycin treatment.): The SCC-25 cell line is a well-established line derived from a human squamous carcinoma of the head and neck. The capacity of this cell line for recovery from potentially lethal damage following X-ray treatment has been documented. The survival curve of stationary phase SCC-25 cells exposed to various concentrations of bleomycin is biphasic with an initial sensitive phase and a less sensitive second phase as is common for many cell lines. Stationary phase SCC-25 cells were exposed to 100 mU ml-1 of bleomycin for 1 h. The drug was removed and the cells were allowed various periods to recover from potentially lethal damage. After 24 h, the SCC-25 cells showed a recovery ratio (R/R0) of 7.0 which corresponded to an immediate survival at a drug level of 27 mU ml-1, a dose 3.7-fold less than the exposure concentration of 100 mU ml-1. Over the course of the first 4 h following bleomycin exposure, 0.5 microM CDDP was a very effective inhibitor of potentially lethal damage repair, giving a R/R0 of 1.1 or nearly compl...
Document 3 (Title: Hepatitis B -- Treatment / Management -- Management): Acute hepatitis B infection is self cleared in 95% of healthy adults. Management is supportive in a majority of patients. Patients with severe acute disease (2 of the 3: bilirubin more than 10 mg/dl, INR more than 1.6 and hepatic encephalopathy) and protracted acute severe disease (total bilirubin more than 3 mg/dl or direct bilirubin more than 1.5 mg/dl, INR more than 1.5, hepatic encephalopathy, or ascites) need antiviral treatment.
