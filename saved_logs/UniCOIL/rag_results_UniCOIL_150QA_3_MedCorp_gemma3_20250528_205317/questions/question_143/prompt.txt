Document 1 (Title: Oral mesalamine (Asacol) for mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis. A multicenter study.): To evaluate the efficacy and safety of a pH-sensitive, polymer-coated oral preparation of mesalamine in patients with mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis. A multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial. Five university-based medical centers, one inflammatory bowel disease center, and three private practice sites. A total of 158 patients with newly or previously diagnosed active ulcerative colitis. A pH-sensitive, polymer-coated oral preparation of mesalamine (5-aminosalicylic acid) was used at 1.6 and 2.4 g/d for 6 weeks. Efficacy was measured by scores for stool frequency, rectal bleeding, patient's functional assessment, sigmoidoscopic findings, and physician's global assessment. Stringent criteria for disease activity were established prospectively. The analysis of protocol-compliant patients showed a significant improvement at 3 weeks in patients taking 2.4 g/d of mesalamine compared with patients taking placebo (32% versus 9%; P = 0.003). At 6 weeks, both the 1.6 g/d (43%) an...
Document 2 (Title: Oxybutynin -- Mechanism of Action -- Pharmacokinetics): Absorption: Oxybutynin is rapidly absorbed by the body after the oral administration of oxybutynin chloride immediate-release tablets, with an absolute bioavailability of approximately 6% (ranging between 1.6% and 10.9%). The drug reaches its maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) within 1 hour and exhibits a plasma half-life of approximately 2 to 3 hours. Clinical data in the literature indicates that oxybutynin solution exhibits a slightly delayed absorption when co-administered with food, resulting in increased bioavailability of approximately 25%.
Document 3 (Title: Obstentrics_Williams): 1.6 is associated with a hydrops risk as high as 60 percent. However, CCAM growth resulting in hydrops develops in fewer than 2 percent of cases if the initial CVR is below 1.6 (Ehrenberg-Buchner, 2013; Peranteau, 2016). Importantly, a CVR in the range of 1.6 indicates that the mass essentially fills the thorax, and thus it is not unexpected that ascites or hydrops may develop.
