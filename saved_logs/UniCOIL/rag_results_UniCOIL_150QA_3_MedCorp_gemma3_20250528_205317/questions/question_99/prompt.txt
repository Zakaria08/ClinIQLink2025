Document 1 (Title: Psichiatry_DSM-5): There is marked variability in prevalence rates of low desire across cultures, ranging from 12.5% in Northern European men to 28% in Southeast Asian men ages 40—80 years. Just as there are higher rates of low desire among East Asian subgroups of women, men of East Asian ancestry also have higher rates of low desire. Guilt about sex may mediate this as- sociation between East Asian ethnicity and sexual desire in men. In contrast to the classification of sexual disorders in women, desire and arousal disorders have been retained as separate constructs in men. Despite some similarities in the experi- ence of desire across men and women, and the fact that desire ﬂuctuates over time and is dependent on contextual factors, men do report a significantly higher intensity and fre- quency of sexual desire compared with women.
Document 2 (Title: Female Sexual Interest and Arousal Disorder -- Epidemiology): FSIAD is the most common female sexual dysfunction. [17] Results from previous studies that assessed the prevalence of sexual desire disorders in women lacked a standardized definition, rendering the reported prevalence unreliable. [18] [2] In recent years, many studies have documented the prevalence of FSIAD based on the standardized definition defined in DSM-IV-TR , with emphasis on the inclusion of the presence of distress. [2] [5] [18] The Pharmacogenomics in Depression Study (PRESIDE) reported the prevalence of FSIAD as ranging from 7.4% among women aged 65 and older to 12.3% among women aged between 45 and 64. Younger women between 18 and 44 had a prevalence of 8.9%. [2] [5] [10] [18] Of note, in the same PRESIDE study, cumulative unadjusted prevalence of sexual desire disorder with and without distress was reportedly 38.7% among all age groups. To identify patients with distress when classifying a patient as having FSIAD, the PRESIDE study used a Female Sexual Distress Scale score of 15 or greater befo...
Document 3 (Title: Intrusive thought): thoughts and stop trying to reassure themselves by checking their bodies. This arousal within the body parts is due to conditioned physiological responses in the brain, which do not respond to the subject of the sexual intrusive thought but rather to the fact that a sexual thought is occurring at all and thus engage an automatic response (research indicates that the correlation between what the genitalia regard as "sexually relevant" and what the brain regards as "sexually appealing" only correlates 50% of the time in men and 10% of the time in women). This means that an arousal response does not necessarily indicate that the person desires what they are thinking about. However, rational thinking processes attempt to explain this reaction and OCD causes people to attribute false meaning and importance to these physiological reactions in an attempt to make sense of them. Sufferers can also experience heightened anxiety caused by "forbidden" images or simply by discussing the matter
