        "content": "Once an abdominal aortic aneurysm ruptures, the prognosis is grim. More than 50% of patients succumb before they reach the emergency room, and those who do survive have very high morbidity. Predictors of mortality include preoperative cardiac arrest, age older than 80, female sex, massive blood loss, and ongoing transfusion. [28] In a patient with a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm, the one factor determining mortality is the ability to achieve proximal control. For those undergoing elective repair, the prognosis is good to excellent. However, long-term survival depends on other comorbidities such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart disease, and peripheral vascular disease. An estimated 70% of patients survive for 5 years after repair.",

        "title": "Elective total hip arthroplasty in patients older than 80 years of age.",
        "content": "Elective total hip arthroplasties (THA) were performed in 91 patients (101 hips) older than 80 years of age at operation. A control group of 87 patients (102 hips) aged 64 to 67 years who had elective THA was chosen statistically to represent the average THA patient. There were 51 minor and eight major perioperative complications in the elderly group and 26 minor and two major complications in the control group. The only in-hospital death was in the control group. The mean hospital stay was two days longer in the elderly group. Five years postoperatively, 83% of the patients in both groups were ambulating without pain. The mean hip score improved from 49 to 84 points in the elderly group and from 52 to 88 points in the control group. These functional results justify elective THA in patients older than 80 years of age.",
