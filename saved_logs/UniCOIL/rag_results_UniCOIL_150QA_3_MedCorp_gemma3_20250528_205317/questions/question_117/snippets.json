        "content": "The radiosensitizing activities and toxicities of misonidazole, metronidazole, 2-Methythio-3-nitropyrrole (3NPR), 2-amino-5-nitrothiazole (ANT) and 2,5-dinitroimidazole (KA121) were studied using EMT6 tumour cells and BALB/c KaRw mice. For 10(-4)M concentrations of the drugs, the DMF's for hypoxic cells were: Misonidazole, 1.6; 3NPR, 1.5, ANT, 1.5; KA121, 1.8. The OER was 3.2. In general, the drugs were toxic to hypoxic cells and were not toxic to aerobic cells at 10(-3)M for 24 h. The LD50's in BALB/c KaRw mice were: misonidazole, 1500 mg/kg; 3NPR, 350 mg/kg ANT, 420 mg/kg. In vivo, 1 mg/g misonidazole or metronidazole reduced the terminal slope of the tumour cell survival curve by a factor of 2.2 or 1.6 respectively.",

        "content": "The half-life for furosemide is 1.5 to 2 hours but can be up to 2.6 hours in those with renal/hepatic dysfunction or heart failure. Bumetanide has a half-life of 1 hour and can be near 1.3 to 1.6 hours in those with renal/hepatic dysfunction or heart failure. Lastly, torsemide is known to have the longest half-life at 3 to 4 hours and can be as long as 5 to 6 hours in patients with renal/hepatic dysfunction or heart failure. All three loops typically have a similar onset of action. Oral administration between the three averages at 30 to 60 minutes. [6] [2] [7] Torsemide provides the longest duration of action and can give even greater diuretic effects in patients with hepatic dysfunction or heart failure.",
