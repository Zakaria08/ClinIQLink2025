        "content": "However, a case study of a 65-year-old man who had frequent headaches for years and was refractory to treatment was finally diagnosed with SUNCT syndrome. He was initiated on 50 mg of clomiphene daily for 2 weeks. Four days after therapy initiation, the frequency of his headaches reduced, but the pain did not subside entirely. The dose was increased to 75 mg daily, and after day 5, the patient became pain-free. After 1.5 months on this dosage, the patient was doing well but experienced a slight recurrence of the attack. His physician increased his clomiphene dose to 100 mg/d, and he had no attacks for 3 months. At this point, the clomiphene was tapered off, and 4 months after discontinuing clomiphene, the patient continued to be pain-free. [13]",

        "title": "Alcoholism and cancer risk: a population-based cohort study.",
        "content": "The incidence of cancer was studied in a population-based cohort of 9,353 individuals (8,340 men and 1,013 women) with a discharge diagnosis of alcoholism in 1965-83, followed up for 19 years (mean 7.7). After exclusion of cancers in the first year of follow-up, 491 cancers were observed cf 343.2 expected through 1984 (standardized incidence ratio [SIR] = 1.4, 95 percent confidence interval [CI] = 1.3-1.6). A similar excess risk of cancer was seen among men (SIR = 1.4, CI = 1.3-1.6) and among women (SIR = 1.5, CI = 1.1-2.0). We observed the established associations with cancers of the oral cavity and pharynx (SIR = 4.1, CI = 2.9-5.7), esophagus (SIR = 6.8, CI = 4.5-9.9), larynx (SIR = 3.3, CI = 1.7-6.0), and lung (SIR = 2.1, CI = 1.7-2.6), although confounding by smoking likely increased these risk estimates. While there was evidence of increased risk for pancreatic cancer (SIR = 1.5, CI = 0.9-2.3), alcoholism did not elevate the incidence of cancer of the stomach (SIR = 0.9, CI = 6-1.4), large bowel (SIR = 1.1, CI = 0.8-1.5), prostate (SIR = 1.0, CI = 0.8-1.3), urinary bladder (SIR = 1.0, CI = 0.6-1.5), or of malignant melanoma (SIR = 0.9, CI = 0.3-1.9). Among women, the number of breast cancers observed was close to expected (SIR = 1.2, CI = 0.6-2.2), although a significant excess number of cervical cancers occurred (SIR = 4.2, CI = 1.5-9.1).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
