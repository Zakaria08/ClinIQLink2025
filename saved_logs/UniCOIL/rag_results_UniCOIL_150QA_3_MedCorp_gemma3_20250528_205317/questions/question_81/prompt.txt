Document 1 (Title: Influence of gonadal hormones and sexual behavior on ultrasonic vocalization in rats: I. Treatment of females.): Ultrasonic vocalizations were measured when male rats were placed with ovariectomized females that had experienced various hormonal and behavioral treatments. In Experiment 1, 18 males were tested with females in each of the following conditions: nonestrous (OVX), estrogen treated (E), estrogen and progesterone treated (EP), and estrogen and progesterone treated and given two intromissions from a stud male prior to testing (EPI). Control conditions included clean cage (CL) and cage soiled by an estrous female (SOI). The treatments differed in effect on rate and maintenance of vocalization: EP greater than E greater than EPI = OVX greater than SOI greater than CL. In tests in which males produced a high rate of vocalization, some males with short intromission latencies shifted from the normal 50-kHz pulse to a 22-kHz pulse. In Experiment 2, the effect of the female's vocalization and movement on the rate of and latency to vocalization was measured. Twenty-one males were presented with each of the following sti...
Document 2 (Title: Histology_Ross): Larynx, monkey, H&E ×15. The vocal folds are ridge-like structures that are oriented in an anteroposterior (ventral-dorsal) direction. In frontal sections, the vocal folds (VF ) are cross-sectioned, giving the appearance seen here. The two vocal folds and the space between them constitute the glottis. Just above each vocal fold is an elongated recess called the ventricle (V ), and above the ventricle is another ridge called the ventricular fold (VnF ) or, sometimes, the false vocal fold. Below and lateral to the vocal folds are the vocalis muscles (VM ). Within the vocal fold is a considerable amount of elastic material, although it is usually not evident in routine H&E preparations. This elastic material is part of the vocal ligament. It lies in an anteroposterior direction within the substance of the vocal fold and plays an important role in phonation.
Document 3 (Title: Chromoblastomycosis -- Etiology): Many melanized fungi can cause chromoblastomycosis, but the main causes are usually from 2 genera: Fonsecaea spp (especially F pedrosoi ) and Cladophialophora spp (especially C carrionii ). [10] [11] Demiataceous fungi (ie, phaeoid, black fungi, pigmented) pathogenic to humans include those nonopportunistic organisms that cause chromoblastomycosis and the opportunistic pathogens that cause pheohyphomycosis, the latter of which is more likely associated with internal organ involvement. [12] Important species for chromoblastomycosis include: Fonsecaea spp: F pedrosoi , F monophora , F nubica , F pugnacious , F brasiliensis , F erecta ) Cladophialophora spp: C carrionii , C yegresii Exophiala spp: E dermatitidis (formerly Wangiella dermatitidis ), E spinifera , E jeanselmei , E alcalophila Phialophora spp: P verrucosa , P americana , P chinensis , P macrospora Rhinocladiella spp: R similis, R mackenziei, R aquaspersa [10] [13] [14] [15] [16]
