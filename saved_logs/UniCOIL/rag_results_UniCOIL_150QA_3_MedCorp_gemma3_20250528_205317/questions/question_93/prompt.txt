Document 3 (Title: Minimizing gang violence in the emergency department.): Street gang members are frequently injured, and the violence of their subculture may follow them from the streets into the emergency department. We present four cases in which in-hospital gang violence occurred or was prevented. To decrease the risk of injury from gang-related violence within the hospital, we offer guidelines for patient care and health care provider safety. Emphasis is on education, awareness, and early hospital security involvement.
