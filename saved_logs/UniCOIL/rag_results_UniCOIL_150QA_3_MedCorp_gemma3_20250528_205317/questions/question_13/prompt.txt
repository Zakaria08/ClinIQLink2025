Document 2 (Title: Hepatitis B -- Treatment / Management -- Management): Acute hepatitis B infection is self cleared in 95% of healthy adults. Management is supportive in a majority of patients. Patients with severe acute disease (2 of the 3: bilirubin more than 10 mg/dl, INR more than 1.6 and hepatic encephalopathy) and protracted acute severe disease (total bilirubin more than 3 mg/dl or direct bilirubin more than 1.5 mg/dl, INR more than 1.5, hepatic encephalopathy, or ascites) need antiviral treatment.
Document 3 (Title: Genetic risk for asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis.): In order to explore the genetic risk of a child with a family history of allergies developing asthma, allergic rhinitis, or atopic dermatitis, questionnaires filled in by 6665 families were analysed. The data were collected in a population based cross sectional survey of 9-11 year old schoolchildren living in Munich and southern Bavaria. The relation between asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis and the number of allergic first degree relatives, and the type of allergic disease was examined. Analyses were done separately for families with single or multiple allergic diseases. In families with one allergic parent the risk of the child developing asthma was increased by asthma in a parent, with an odds ratio (OR) of 2.6 (95% confidence interval 1.7 to 4.0) but not by parental allergic rhinitis with OR 1.0 (0.7 to 1.5) or atopic dermatitis, OR 1.0 (0.6 to 1.6). For allergic rhinitis the highest risk with OR 3.6 (2.9 to 4.6) was observed with allergic rhinitis of one parent, apparently lower for asthma...

Question: A 9-month-old female is brought to the emergency department after experiencing a seizure. She was born at home and was normal at birth according to her parents. Since then, they have noticed that she does not appear to be achieving developmental milestones as quickly as her siblings, and often appears lethargic. Physical exam reveals microcephaly, very light pigmentation (as compared to her family), and a "musty" body odor. The varied manifestations of this disease can most likely be attributed to which of the following genetic principles?
Options:
A. Anticipation
B. Multiple gene mutations
C. Pleiotropy
D. Variable expressivity
