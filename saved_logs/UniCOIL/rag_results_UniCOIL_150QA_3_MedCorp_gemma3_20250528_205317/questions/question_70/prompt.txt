Document 1 (Title: PMCs--an alternative to DRGs for trauma care reimbursement.): Payments made for inpatient trauma care were compared using two different patient classification systems--Patient Management Categories (PMCs) and Diagnosis Related Groups (DRGs). Two databases were used in this study: 1) estimated costs for all inpatient claims from one large payor for adult injured patients (n = 5,256) treated at 79 acute care facilities (trauma centers and non-trauma centers) in one geographic region; and 2) hospital charges from statewide, all-payor Maryland data, including 25,987 adult injured patients. The accuracy of PMCs and DRGs in predicting actual costs was examined by level of injury severity and by types of hospital, trauma center vs. non-trauma center. Level of injury (minor, single significant, multiple significant, and major) were defined and operationalized using PMCs. Overall, both DRG and PMC payment systems were nearly equal to the actual costs associated with all injured patients. This relationship can be designed into the weighting scale used for payment. The distributio...
Document 2 (Title: Disaster medicine): Medical contingency planning – The act of devising a methodology for meeting the medical requirements of a population affected by a disaster event. Medical surge – An influx of patients (physical casualties and psychological casualties), bystanders, visitors, family members, media and individuals searching for the missing who present to a hospital or healthcare facility for treatment, information and/or shelter as a result of a disaster. Surge capacity – The ability to manage a sudden, unexpected increase in patient volume that would otherwise severely challenge or exceed the current capacity of the health care system. Medical triage – The separation of patients based on severity of injury or illness in light of available resources. Psychosocial triage – The separation of patients based on the severity of psychological injury or impact in light of available resources.
Document 3 (Title: EMS Terrorism Response -- Clinical Significance): Command, control, and communication require emphasis. EMS, as well as hospital administrators, should be included as it is essential to anticipate surge capacity. The inclusion of all local hospitals is vital in contingency plans as the number of severely injured patients may become overwhelming even for a level 1 trauma center. [18]

Question: Israeli hospital preparedness for terrorism-related multiple casualty incidents: can the surge capacity and injury severity distribution be better predicted?
