        "content": "The catabolism of saturated fatty acids through beta-oxidation does not directly produce trans-alpha-beta unsaturated metabolites. Instead, the initial step of beta-oxidation creates a trans double bond between the alpha and beta carbons, which is then followed by further steps that ultimately lead to acetyl-CoA. 20.6 Stage II of Lipid Catabolism | The Basics of General ... Here's a more detailed explanation: Beta-oxidation: This is the main pathway for breaking down fatty acids in the body. It occurs in the mitochondria and involves a series of reactions that cleave two carbons from the fatty acid at a time. First step: The first step of beta-oxidation is the dehydrogenation of the fatty acid, which introduces a trans double bond between the alpha and beta carbons of the fatty acyl-CoA. This step is catalyzed by acyl-CoA dehydrogenase and produces trans-delta-2-enoyl-CoA. Subsequent steps: After the formation of the trans double bond, the fatty acid is then hydrated, oxidized, and cleaved to release acetyl-CoA and a shorter fatty acyl-CoA. No trans-alpha-beta unsaturated metabolites: While the initial step does create a trans double bond, the subsequent steps in beta-oxidation do not result in the accumulation of trans-alpha-beta unsaturated metabolites. The trans double bond is part of the overall process of breaking down the fatty acid, not a product that is formed. In summary, the catabolism of saturated fatty acids through beta-oxidation does involve the formation of a trans double bond initially, but the final products are acetyl-CoA and a shorter fatty acyl-CoA, not trans-alpha-beta unsaturated metabolites.",

        "content": "In the cytosol of the cell (for example a muscle cell), the glycerol will be converted to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, which is an intermediate in the glycolysis, to get further oxidized and produce energy. However, the main steps of fatty acids catabolism occur in the mitochondria. Long chain fatty acids (more than 14 carbon) need to be converted to fatty acyl-CoA in order to pass across the mitochondria membrane. Fatty acid catabolism begins in the cytoplasm of cells as acyl-CoA synthetase uses the energy from cleavage of an ATP to catalyze the addition of coenzyme A to the fatty acid. The resulting acyl-CoA cross the mitochondria membrane and enter the process of beta oxidation. The main products of the beta oxidation pathway are acetyl-CoA (which is used in the citric acid cycle to produce energy), NADH and FADH. The process of beta oxidation requires the following enzymes: acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, enoyl-CoA hydratase, 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, and 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase.",

        "content": "Mitochondrial beta-oxidation can be used to supply acetyl coenzyme A (CoA) to 2 separate pathways, depending on which tissue oxidation occurs. In skeletal and cardiac muscle, mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation leads to substrate production for the tricarboxylic acid cycle in the form of acetyl CoA and provides adenosine triphosphate (ATP) for the myocytes. However, in hepatocytes, fatty acid oxidation provides acetyl CoA for ketone body synthesis during prolonged fasting conditions, in which glycogen stores have been depleted. Mitochondrial beta-oxidation yields 4 ATP equivalents per round of oxidation in the form of one flavin adenine dinucleotide, FAD(2H) molecule and 1 nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (reduced, NADH) molecule, as well as one acetyl CoA molecule.",
