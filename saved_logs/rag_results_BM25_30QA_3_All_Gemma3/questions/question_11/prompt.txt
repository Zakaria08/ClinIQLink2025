Document 1 (Title: Urticaria Pigmentosa  -- Treatment / Management): The management of cutaneous mastocytosis begins with practical measures, such as the use of lukewarm water for bathing, air conditioning during hot weather, and avoidance of triggers for mast cell degranulation. Treatment is symptomatic for patients with cutaneous mastocytosis.
Document 2 (Title: Syncope during bathing in infants a pediatric form of water induced urticaria): Background: Apparent life threatening events in infants are a difficult and frequent problem in pediatric practice. The prognosis is uncertain because of risk of sudden infant death syndrome. Case reports: Eight infants aged 2 to 15 months were admitted during a period of 6 years; they suffered from similar maladies in the bath: on immersion, they became pale, hypotonic, still and unreactive; recovery took a few seconds after withdrawal from the bath and stimulation. Two diagnoses were initially considered: seizure or gastroesophageal reflux but this was doubtful. The hypothesis of an equivalent of aquagenic urticaria was then considered; as for patients with this disease, each infant's family contained members suffering from dermographism, maladies or eruption after exposure to water or sun. All six infants had dermographism. We found an increase in blood histamine levels after a trial bath in the two infants tested. The evolution of these "aquagenic maladies" was favourable after a few weeks without baths. After a 2–7 year follow up, three out of seven infants continue to suffer from troubles associated with sun or water. Conclusion: "Aquagenic maladies" could be a pediatric form of the aquagenic urticaria.
Document 3 (Title: Idiopathic acquired cold urticaria in North India.): Forty-three otherwise healthy patients mostly between the ages of 10 and 40 were seen in North India during a two-year period with urticaria which developed on taking a cold water bath, exposure to cold winds, evaporation of rain water or sweat in that order of frequency. There was no familial predisposition to cold urticaria or atopic disorders. The refrigeration test for cryo-proteins was negative. Only one patient developed a wheal on contact with ice but 38 of 43 patients showed an exaggerated erythema response to a cold-pressure test (cryo-stimulation test).
