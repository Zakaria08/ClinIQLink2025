Document 1 (Title: Opportunistic CNS Infections in Immunomodulatory Therapy): Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) represents a severe demyelinating disease of the central nervous system caused by reactivation of the John Cunningham virus (JCV), a polyomavirus that asymptomatically infects approximately 50-80% of the general adult population. In the setting of immunocompromised states, viral reactivation leads to lytic infection of oligodendrocytes, resulting in multifocal areas of demyelination throughout the brain, particularly affecting subcortical white matter. Historically associated with advanced HIV infection, hematological malignancies, and organ transplantation, PML has gained significant attention more recently in the context of immunomodulatory therapies, particularly monoclonal antibodies targeting immune cell trafficking or function. Among these agents, natalizumab has demonstrated the strongest association with PML development. Natalizumab, an α4-integrin antagonist approved for treatment of multiple sclerosis and Crohn's disease, inhibits lymphocyte adhesion to vascular endothelium, thereby preventing inflammatory cell migration across the blood-brain barrier and into intestinal mucosa. This mechanism, while effective in reducing inflammation, simultaneously impairs immunosurveillance within the central nervous system, creating conditions favorable for JCV reactivation and proliferation. Risk factors for natalizumab-associated PML include longer duration of therapy (particularly beyond 24 months), prior immunosuppressant use, and positive serostatus for JCV antibodies. Clinical manifestations reflect the distribution of demyelinating lesions, typically presenting as subacute, progressive neurological deficits including altered mental status, cognitive impairment, motor weakness, ataxia, visual disturbances, and aphasia. The diagnosis relies primarily on magnetic resonance imaging, which characteristically demonstrates hyperintense lesions on T2-weighted and FLAIR sequences in the subcortical white matter, without significant mass effect or contrast enhancement. These lesions typically demonstrate a predilection for the frontal and parieto-occipital regions, with involvement of the corpus callosum and posterior fossa structures in many cases. Definitive diagnosis requires detection of JCV DNA in cerebrospinal fluid through polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or, less commonly, brain biopsy demonstrating the characteristic histopathological triad of demyelination, abnormal oligodendrocytes with enlarged nuclei, and bizarre astrocytes. Management centers on immune reconstitution, typically achieved through discontinuation of the offending immunosuppressive agent, though this approach carries risk of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS).
Document 2 (Title: Recurrent Rectal Cancer Management Following Primary Radiotherapy): Pelvic exenteration represents a potentially curative option for selected patients with recurrent rectal cancer, though previous treatments may influence subsequent surgical outcomes. Multivariate analysis of prognostic factors reveals that primary tumor radiotherapy history significantly impacts post-exenteration prognosis through several documented mechanisms. Retrospective review of 182 patients undergoing pelvic exenteration for recurrent disease demonstrated that prior radiotherapy was independently associated with reduced 5-year survival (hazard ratio 1.78, 95% CI 1.26-2.47) after controlling for other established prognostic variables. Histopathological analysis of exenteration specimens revealed that previously irradiated tumors demonstrated altered recurrence patterns, with increased likelihood of multifocal pelvic disease and perineural invasion compared to radiation-naïve recurrences. Intraoperative assessment consistently documented increased technical difficulty achieving clear margins in previously irradiated fields, with complete resection rates of 72% versus 89% in non-irradiated cases. Additionally, postoperative complication profiles showed significant differences, with prior radiotherapy associated with doubled rates of major wound complications and anastomotic failures. Tissue analysis demonstrated radiation-induced fibrosis and microvascular changes that appear to both complicate surgical procedures and potentially provide microenvironmental conditions favoring aggressive tumor biology. These findings remain significant in multivariate modeling accounting for radiation timing, dose, and fractionation schedules. Notably, neoadjuvant radiotherapy for the primary tumor demonstrated stronger negative prognostic impact than adjuvant approaches. These relationships have important implications for primary rectal cancer management decisions, as treatment approaches potentially influence salvage options for future recurrences. Emerging evidence suggests that alternative primary management strategies preserving radiation as a salvage option may warrant consideration in selected cases after accounting for these documented prognostic relationships.
Document 3 (Title: Current Recommendations for Reducing Sudden Infant Death Syndrome Risk): Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) remains a leading cause of death in infants between one month and one year of age, with peak incidence between two and four months. Following comprehensive epidemiological studies and the introduction of targeted preventive measures, SIDS rates have declined significantly over the past three decades. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and similar organizations worldwide have established evidence-based recommendations focusing on modifiable risk factors. The single most effective intervention involves infant sleep positioning, with clear evidence demonstrating that placing infants on their backs (supine position) on a firm sleep surface reduces SIDS risk by approximately 50%. This 'Back to Sleep' campaign has been credited with the dramatic reduction in SIDS rates since its introduction in the 1990s. Contrary to previous practices, maintaining a high ambient room temperature and excessive bundling are now recognized as potential risk factors rather than protective measures. Similarly, the use of positioning devices, wedges, or rolled blankets to maintain sleep position is discouraged due to suffocation risks. While some studies suggested that pacifier use during sleep might confer modest protective effects, avoiding pacifiers was not found to reduce SIDS risk. Current guidelines emphasize room-sharing without bed-sharing, avoiding soft bedding or objects in the sleep environment, and eliminating exposure to tobacco smoke as additional key preventive strategies.

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
Question: A 35-year-old woman with a history of Crohn disease presents for a follow-up appointment. She says that lately, she has started to notice difficulty walking. She says that some of her friends have joked that she appears to be walking as if she was drunk. Past medical history is significant for Crohn disease diagnosed 2 years ago, managed with natalizumab for the past year because her intestinal symptoms have become severe and unresponsive to other therapies. On physical examination, there is gait and limb ataxia present. Strength is 4/5 in the right upper limb. A T1/T2 MRI of the brain is ordered and is shown. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options:
A. Sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD)
B. Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD)
C. Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE)
D. Progressive multifocal encephalopathy (PML)
