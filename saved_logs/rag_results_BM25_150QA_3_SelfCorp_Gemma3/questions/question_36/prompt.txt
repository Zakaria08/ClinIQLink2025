Document 1 (Title: Non-Classical Manifestations of Coronary Artery Disease): While classic angina typically presents as substernal chest pressure exacerbated by exertion and relieved by rest or nitroglycerin, atypical presentations of myocardial ischemia occur frequently, particularly in women, diabetic patients, and elderly individuals. These variant manifestations, sometimes termed angina equivalents, include exertional dyspnea without chest discomfort, epigastric or abdominal discomfort, and jaw or arm pain without accompanying chest sensations. Upper abdominal discomfort represents a particularly challenging variant that may be misattributed to gastrointestinal etiologies, delaying appropriate cardiac evaluation. The pathophysiological basis for these atypical presentations involves complex neurological mechanisms, with cardiac nociceptive signals sharing afferent pathways with those from other visceral structures, particularly the esophagus and upper gastrointestinal tract. Patients with significant cardiovascular risk factors reporting upper abdominal discomfort that correlates with physical exertion warrant careful evaluation for potential cardiac ischemia, even in the absence of classic chest pain. Diagnostic approaches differ markedly between suspected cardiac and gastrointestinal etiologies. While endoscopic evaluation may seem intuitive for abdominal symptoms, non-invasive cardiac assessment should take precedence when the clinical presentation suggests possible angina equivalent. Exercise stress testing, with or without imaging, provides valuable diagnostic and prognostic information by detecting inducible myocardial ischemia under controlled conditions. Functional testing such as hydrogen breath testing for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth or abdominal ultrasonography for biliary disease may be appropriate in patients where cardiac etiologies have been excluded or when symptoms and risk profile suggest primary gastrointestinal pathology.
Document 2 (Title: Differential Diagnosis of Infantile Vomiting Disorders): Non-bilious vomiting in the neonatal and early infancy periods represents a diagnostic challenge, with potential etiologies ranging from relatively benign conditions to life-threatening surgical emergencies. When presenting in the 2-8 week age range, infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS) emerges as a principal consideration. This acquired condition involves progressive hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the circular muscle layer of the pylorus, resulting in gastric outlet obstruction. The pathophysiology involves abnormal innervation of the pylorus with deficient inhibitory neurons containing nitric oxide synthase, leading to uncoordinated contractions and subsequent muscular hypertrophy. This differs fundamentally from congenital anomalies present at birth, such as duodenal atresia, which typically manifests with bilious vomiting within the first 24-48 hours of life due to obstruction distal to the ampulla of Vater. Similarly, annular pancreas, where pancreatic tissue encircles the duodenum, presents with early obstruction and bilious emesis. Gastroschisis and other midline defects resulting from failed ventral wall fusion present with visible abdominal wall defects rather than isolated vomiting. The classic presentation of pyloric stenosis includes progressive, projectile non-bilious vomiting, visible peristaltic waves, and, on careful examination, a palpable 'olive' in the right upper quadrant representing the hypertrophied pylorus. Ultrasound confirmation demonstrates increased pyloric muscle thickness (>3mm) and elongated pyloric channel (>14mm).
Document 3 (Title: Recurrent Rectal Cancer Management Following Primary Radiotherapy): Pelvic exenteration represents a potentially curative option for selected patients with recurrent rectal cancer, though previous treatments may influence subsequent surgical outcomes. Multivariate analysis of prognostic factors reveals that primary tumor radiotherapy history significantly impacts post-exenteration prognosis through several documented mechanisms. Retrospective review of 182 patients undergoing pelvic exenteration for recurrent disease demonstrated that prior radiotherapy was independently associated with reduced 5-year survival (hazard ratio 1.78, 95% CI 1.26-2.47) after controlling for other established prognostic variables. Histopathological analysis of exenteration specimens revealed that previously irradiated tumors demonstrated altered recurrence patterns, with increased likelihood of multifocal pelvic disease and perineural invasion compared to radiation-naïve recurrences. Intraoperative assessment consistently documented increased technical difficulty achieving clear margins in previously irradiated fields, with complete resection rates of 72% versus 89% in non-irradiated cases. Additionally, postoperative complication profiles showed significant differences, with prior radiotherapy associated with doubled rates of major wound complications and anastomotic failures. Tissue analysis demonstrated radiation-induced fibrosis and microvascular changes that appear to both complicate surgical procedures and potentially provide microenvironmental conditions favoring aggressive tumor biology. These findings remain significant in multivariate modeling accounting for radiation timing, dose, and fractionation schedules. Notably, neoadjuvant radiotherapy for the primary tumor demonstrated stronger negative prognostic impact than adjuvant approaches. These relationships have important implications for primary rectal cancer management decisions, as treatment approaches potentially influence salvage options for future recurrences. Emerging evidence suggests that alternative primary management strategies preserving radiation as a salvage option may warrant consideration in selected cases after accounting for these documented prognostic relationships.

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
Question: A 35-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 1-month history of double vision, difficulty climbing stairs, and weakness when trying to brush her hair. She reports that these symptoms are worse after she exercises and disappear after she rests for a few hours. Physical examination shows drooping of her right upper eyelid that worsens when the patient is asked to gaze at the ceiling for 2 minutes. There is diminished motor strength in the upper extremities. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options:
A. Myasthenia gravis
B. Polymyositis
C. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
D. Multiple sclerosis
