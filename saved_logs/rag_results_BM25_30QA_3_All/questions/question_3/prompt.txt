Document 1 (Title: Surgical Options in the Treatment of Severe Obesity -- Issues of Concern -- Bariatric Procedures for Management of Severe Obesity): The weight loss mechanism typically falls into 1 of 2 categories, but some procedures have both components. These mechanisms include malabsorption and restriction. Neurohormonal effects contribute to the regulation of energy balance and hunger control. Key hormones include leptin and ghrelin. Examples of restrictive procedures include vertical banded gastroplasty, laparoscopic adjustable gastric band, and sleeve gastrectomy. Malabsorptive procedures include jejunoileal bypass, biliopancreatic diversion (BPD), or biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch. A combination procedure commonly performed is the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. [6]
Document 2 (Title: Gastric Restrictive Procedures): 1. Vertical-Banded Gastroplasty (CPT code 43842) Vertical-banded gastroplasty was formerly one of the most common gastric restrictive procedures performed in the United States but has now been replaced by other restrictive procedures due to high rates of revisions and reoperations. In this procedure, the stomach is segmented along its vertical axis. To create a durable reinforced and rate-limiting stoma at the distal end of the pouch, a plug of stomach is removed, and a propylene collar is placed through this hole and then stapled to itself. Because the normal flow of food is preserved, metabolic complications are uncommon. Complications include esophageal reflux, dilation, or obstruction of the stoma, with the latter two requiring reoperation. Dilation of the stoma is a common reason for weight regain. Vertical-banded gastroplasty may be performed using an open or laparoscopic approach. 2. Adjustable Gastric Banding (CPT code 43770) Adjustable gastric banding involves placing a gastric band around the exterior of the stomach. The band is attached to a reservoir that is implanted subcutaneously in the rectus sheath. Injecting the reservoir with saline will alter the diameter of the gastric band; therefore, the rate-limiting stoma in the stomach can be progressively narrowed to induce greater weight loss, or expanded if complications develop. Because the stomach is not entered, the surgery and any revisions, if necessary, are relatively simple. Complications include slippage of the external band or band erosion through the gastric wall. Currently, two such devices are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for marketing in the United States. The first to receive FDA approval was the LapBand (Apollo Endosurgery). The labeled indications for Lap Band devices are as follows: "The Lap-Band system is indicated for use in weight reduction for severely obese patients with a body mass index (BMI) of at least 40 or a BMI of at least 35 with one or more severe comorbid conditions, or those who are 100 lbs or more over their estimated ideal weight according to the 1983 Metropolitan Life Insurance Tables (use the midpoint for medium frame). It is indicated for use only in severely obese adult patients who have failed more conservative weight-reduction alternatives, such as supervised diet, exercise and behavior modification programs. Patients who elect to have this surgery must make the commitment to accept significant changes in their eating habits for the rest of their lives." In 2011, FDA-labelled indications for the LAP-BAND were expanded to include patients with a BMI from 30 to 34 with at least 1 obesity-related comorbid condition. The second adjustable gastric banding device was approved by the FDA through the Premarket Approval (PMA) process in September 2007, the REALIZE model (Ethicon Endosurgery, Cincinnati, OH). Labeled indications for this device are as listed below: "The [REALIZE] device is indicated for weight reduction for morbidly obese patients and is indicated for individuals with a BMI of at least 40 kg/m2, or a BMI of at least 35 kg/m2 with one or more comorbid conditions. The band is indicated for use only in morbidly obese adult patients who have failed more conservative weight-reduction alternatives, such as supervised diet, exercise, and behavior modification programs." 3. Sleeve gastrectomy (CPT code 43775) A sleeve gastrectomy is an alternative approach to gastrectomy that can be performed on its own, or in combination with malabsorptive procedures (most commonly biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch). In this procedure, the greater curvature of the stomach is resected from the angle of His to the distal antrum, resulting in a stomach remnant shaped like a tube or sleeve. The pyloric sphincter is preserved, resulting in a more physiologic transit of food from the stomach to the duodenum, and avoiding the dumping syndrome (overly rapid transport of food through stomach into intestines) that is seen with distal gastrectomy. This procedure can be done by the open or laparoscopic technique. Some surgeons have proposed this as the first in a two-stage procedure for very high-risk patients. Weight loss following sleeve gastrectomy may improve a patient’s overall medical status, and thus reduce the risk of a subsequent more extensive malabsorptive procedure, such as biliopancreatic diversion.
Document 3 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): sur-gical risk,59 especially if the obesity is so severe that the patient cannot normally do self-care or would not likely be able to do so after surgery. In addition to excessive morbidity, the placement of these individuals in care facilities postoperatively for recovery is often impossible due to their size and limitations of physical ability. Finally, lack of sufficient social support or an extremely poor or unsupportive home environment can be contraindications to surgical care, since such environmental factors are important to optimize outcomes once discharged from the hospital.Brunicardi_Ch27_p1167-p1218.indd 117323/02/19 2:20 PM 1174SPECIFIC CONSIDERATIONSPART IIABCDEFGHFigure 27-5.
