        "content": "The simplest way to assess intellectual abilities is through language skills. Language function is receptive (understanding speech or gestures) and expressive (speech and use of gestures). Abnormalities of language resulting from cerebral hemisphere disorders are referred to as aphasias. Anterior, expressive, or Broca aphasia is characterized by sparse, non-fluent language. Posterior, receptive, or Wernicke aphasia is characterized by an inability to understand language, with speech that is fluent but nonsensical. Global aphasia refers to impaired expressive and receptive language. The cranial nerve evaluation assesses brainstem integrity but depends on the stage of brain maturation and the ability to cooperate. A colorful toy may capture a young child\u2019s attention and permit observation of coordination, movement, and cranial nerve function.",

        "title": "Temporal dimensions of consonant and vowel production: an acoustic and CT scan analysis of aphasic speech.",
        "content": "This study explored a number of temporal (durational) parameters of consonant and vowel production in order to determine whether the speech production impairments of aphasics are the result of the same or different underlying mechanisms and in particular whether they implicate deficits that are primarily phonetic or phonological in nature. Detailed analyses of CT scan lesion data were also conducted to explore whether more specific neuroanatomical correlations could be made with speech production deficits. A series of acoustic analyses were conducted including voice-onset time, intrinsic and contrastive fricative duration, and intrinsic and contrastive vowel duration as produced by Broca's aphasics with anterior lesions (A patients), nonfluent aphasics with anterior and posterior lesions (AP patients), and fluent aphasics with posterior lesions (P patients). The constellation of impairments for the anterior aphasics including both the A and AP patients suggests that their disorder primarily reflects an inability to implement particular types of articulatory gestures or articulatory parameters rather than an inability to implement particular phonetic features. They display impairments in the implementation of laryngeal gestures for both consonant and vowel production. These patterns seem to relate to particular anatomical sites involving Broca's area, the anterior limb of the internal capsule, and the lowest motor cortex areas for larynx and tongue. The posterior patients also show evidence of subtle phonetic impairments suggesting that the neural instantiation of speech may require more extensive involvement, including the perisylvian area, than previously suggested.",
