Document 1 (Title: Double-balloon enteroscopy): The double-balloon enteroscope can also be passed in retrograde fashion, through the colon and into the ileum to visualize the end of the small bowel. Indications Double-balloon enteroscopy has found a niche application in the following settings: Bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract of obscure cause Iron deficiency anemia with normal colonoscopy and gastroscopy Visualization and therapeutic intervention on abnormalities seen on traditional small bowel imaging Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in post-surgical patients with long afferent limbs Advantages and disadvantages
Document 2 (Title: Status evaluation: enteroscopy.): Enteroscopy is a method to examine the small bowel mucosa beyond the reach of standard upper endoscopes. In practice it has primarily been used to search for a bleeding lesion in patients where one is not detected by conventional means. Such patients constitute only a small percentage of those who bleed (15,20). Experience is greatest with push enteroscopy. Examination of the distal duodenum and proximal jejunum using a standard or pediatric colonoscope is practical, appears to be safe and provides a satisfactory diagnostic and therapeutic yield in experienced hands. Longer designated push enteroscopes are under investigation. Sonde type enteroscopes can be passed to the ileum in most cases. A cause for bleeding can be detected in approximately one-quarter to one-third of individuals with minimal morbidity. Certain technical problems limit their efficacy and their role in the evaluation of patients with bleeding has not yet been clearly defined.
Document 3 (Title: Biochemistry Fatty Acid Oxidation): The catabolism of saturated fatty acids through beta-oxidation does not directly produce trans-alpha-beta unsaturated metabolites. Instead, the initial step of beta-oxidation creates a trans double bond between the alpha and beta carbons, which is then followed by further steps that ultimately lead to acetyl-CoA. 20.6 Stage II of Lipid Catabolism | The Basics of General ... Here's a more detailed explanation: Beta-oxidation: This is the main pathway for breaking down fatty acids in the body. It occurs in the mitochondria and involves a series of reactions that cleave two carbons from the fatty acid at a time. First step: The first step of beta-oxidation is the dehydrogenation of the fatty acid, which introduces a trans double bond between the alpha and beta carbons of the fatty acyl-CoA. This step is catalyzed by acyl-CoA dehydrogenase and produces trans-delta-2-enoyl-CoA. Subsequent steps: After the formation of the trans double bond, the fatty acid is then hydrated, oxidized, and cleaved to release acetyl-CoA and a shorter fatty acyl-CoA. No trans-alpha-beta unsaturated metabolites: While the initial step does create a trans double bond, the subsequent steps in beta-oxidation do not result in the accumulation of trans-alpha-beta unsaturated metabolites. The trans double bond is part of the overall process of breaking down the fatty acid, not a product that is formed. In summary, the catabolism of saturated fatty acids through beta-oxidation does involve the formation of a trans double bond initially, but the final products are acetyl-CoA and a shorter fatty acyl-CoA, not trans-alpha-beta unsaturated metabolites.
