Document 1 (Title: Comparison of Landolt C and Snellen E Acuity in Strabismus Amblyopia): Purpose: Assessment of visual acuity depends on the optotypes used for measurement. The ability to recognize different optotypes differs even if their critical detail appears under the same visual angle. Since optotypes are evaluated on individuals with good visual acuity and without eye disorders, differences in the lower visual acuity range cannot be excluded. In this study, visual acuity measured with the Snellen E was compared to the Landolt C acuity. Methods: 100 patients (age 8 90 years, median 60.5 years) with different eye disorders, among them 39 with amblyopia due to strabismus, and 13 healthy volunteers (age 18 33 years, median 24 years) were tested. Visual acuity assessment was performed using charts with the Snellen E and the Landolt C (Precision Vision) which mimic the ETDRS charts. 3 out of 5 optotypes per line had to be correctly identified, while wrong answers were monitored. In the group of patients, the eyes with the lower visual acuity, and for the healthy subjects, the right eyes were evaluated. Results: Differences between Landolt C (LR) and Snellen E (SE) acuity were small. The mean decimal values for LR and SE were 0.25±0.4 and 0.29±0.4 in the entire group and 0.14±0.8 and 0.16±0.8 for the eyes with strabismus amblyopia. The mean difference between LR and SE was 0.55 lines in the entire group and 0.55 lines for the eyes with strabismus amblyopia, with higher values for the Snellen E in both groups. In the acuity range below 0.1, the mean difference between LR and SE was 0.58 lines for the entire group and 0.58 lines for the eyes with strabismic amblyopia with higher values for the Snellen E in both groups. Conclusions: Using the charts described, there was only a slight overestimation of visual acuity by the Snellen E compared to the Landolt C, even in strabismus amblyopia. Small differences in the lower visual acuity range have to be considered.
Document 2 (Title: Nutrition: Micronutrient Intake, Imbalances, and Interventions -- Definition/Introduction -- Water-Soluble Vitamins): Vitamin B12 (cobalamin): Vitamin B12 is a water-soluble vitamin that is a cofactor in synthesizing DNA, fatty acids, and myelin, as well as erythropoiesis and the development of the nervous system. [7] [29] Bacteria synthesize cobalamin in the gastrointestinal tract of animals, and the host later absorbs it. Because vitamin B12 is concentrated in animal tissues, it is virtually found only in animal products such as meat, dairy, and eggs. [29] [30] The RDA of vitamin B12 for adults is 2.4 mcg/d. [31]
Document 3 (Title: Biochemistry_Lippinco): Prognosis: The prognosis for recovery is excellent. Case-Related Questions: Choose the ONE best answer. Q1. Which of the following statements about vitamin C is correct? Vitamin C is: A. a competitor of iron absorption in the intestine. B. a fat-soluble vitamin with a 3-month supply typically stored in adipose tissue. C. a coenzyme in several enzymic reactions such as the hydroxylation of proline. D. required for the cross-linking of collagen. Q2. In contrast to the microcytic anemia characteristic of iron deficiency (common in older adults), a macrocytic anemia is seen with deficiencies of vitamin B12 and/or folic acid. These vitamin deficiencies are also common in older adults. Which of the following statements concerning these vitamins is correct? A. An inability to absorb B12 results in pernicious anemia. B. Both vitamins cause changes in gene expression. C. Folic acid plays a key role in energy metabolism in most cells.
