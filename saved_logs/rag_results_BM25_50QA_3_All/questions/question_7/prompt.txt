Document 1 (Title: Global prevalence of sleep disorders during menopause a meta analysis): Background: Sleep disorders are conditions that have long term effects on health, quality of sexual function, productivity at work, and overall quality of life. Considering that reports on menopausal sleep disorders are heterogeneous, the aim of this research was to determine the global prevalence of sleep disorders during menopause by meta analysis. Methods: PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus, WoS, ScienceDirect, and Embase databases were checked with suitable keywords. All screening stages of articles were reviewed based on PRISMA and their quality was determined based on STROBE. Data analysis, examination of heterogeneity, and publication bias of factors affecting heterogeneity were performed in CMA software. Results: The overall prevalence of sleep disorders among postmenopausal women was 51.6% (95% CI: 44.6–58.5%). The upper prevalence of sleep disorders was among postmenopausal women at 54.7% (95% CI: 47.2–62.1%). The upper prevalence of sleep disorders in the same population category was related to restless legs syndrome with a prevalence of 63.8% (95% CI: 10.6–96.3%). Conclusion: In this meta analysis, sleep disorders during menopause were found to be common and significant. Therefore, it is recommended that health policymakers offer pertinent interventions in relation to the health and hygiene of sleep for women in menopause.

Document 3 (Title: Unrecognized association of sleep disorders and depression with chronic pelvic pain.): Assessment of cases of chronic pelvic pain presents a challenging problem, and many physicians overlook the association of sleep disorders and depression with such pain. We examined these linkages in our chronic pelvic pain clinic, using a questionnaire that assists in diagnosis and management of these cases. To date, the cases of 72 patients (both physician- and self-referred) with pelvic pain have been evaluated. Of these patients, 51 of 71 (72%) reported sleep disorders, and 37 of 72 (51%) had clinical depression, as determined by the Beck Depression Inventory. After adjustment for a sleep-related item on the Beck scale, these two measures showed a positive correlation of .355 (P &lt; .01). The scores of pain patients differed significantly from those of a control group of asymptomatic patients on the depression and sleep disorder measures. By being aware and using a simple questionnaire, the clinician may readily identify overlooked factors, such as sleep disorders and depression, when assessing cases of chronic pelvic pain.
