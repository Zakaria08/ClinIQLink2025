Document 1 (Title: Metronidazole -- Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes): There should be judicious prescribing of metronidazole by providers only for known indications and high clinical suspicion for needing treatment of anaerobic bacterial infections, protozoal infections, and microaerophilic bacterial infections. Overprescribing may contribute to increasing future antibiotic resistance to the drug, so a pharmacy consult is necessary for the prescriber to ensure directed therapy. The documentation already exists regarding increased resistance to metronidazole in the treatment of C. difficile infections. Also, prescribers, nurses, and pharmacists should routinely educate patients to abstain from alcoholic beverages while taking metronidazole, which will help lead to fewer disulfiram reaction symptoms; nursing will play a role in this monitoring and for other potential adverse effects. The patient should also be informed by the health care provider of the possible change in urine color while on this medicine. The team of health professionals, including physicians, physician assistants, nurses, and pharmacists, must work together to provide the best care for these patients when using metronidazole in any formulation.

Document 2 (Title: Exploring novel pyrazole nitroimidazole hybrids): “Trichomoniasis, a prevalent sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by the protozoan Trichomonas vaginalis, has gained increased significance globally. Its relevance has grown in recent years due to its association with a heightened risk of acquiring and transmitting the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and other STIs. In addition, many publications have revealed a potential link between trichomoniasis and certain cancers. Metronidazole (MTZ), a nitroimidazole compound developed over 50 years ago, remains the first choice drug for treatment. However, reports of genotoxicity and side effects underscore the necessity for new compounds to address this pressing global health concern. In this study, we synthesized ten pyrazole nitroimidazoles 1(a j) and 4 nitro 1 (hydroxyethyl) 1H imidazole 2, an analog of metronidazole (MTZ), and assessed their trichomonacidal and cytotoxic effects. All compounds 1(a j) and 2 exhibited IC50 values ≤ 20 μM and ≤ 41 μM, after 24 h and 48 h, respectively. Compounds 1d (IC50 5.3 μM), 1e (IC50 4.8 μM), and 1i (IC50 5.2 μM) exhibited potencies equivalent to MTZ (IC50 4.9 μM), the reference drug, after 24 h. Notably, compound 1i showed high anti trichomonas activity after 24 h (IC50 5.2 μM) and 48 h (IC50 2.1 μM). Additionally, all compounds demonstrated either non cytotoxic to HeLa cells (CC50 > 100 μM) or low cytotoxicity (CC50 between 69 and 100 μM). These findings suggest that pyrazole nitroimidazole derivatives represent a promising heterocyclic system, serving as a potential lead for further optimization in trichomoniasis chemotherapy.
Document 3 (Title: Nitroimidazole): Nitroimidazole antibiotics From the chemistry perspective, nitroimidazole antibiotics can be classified according to the location of the nitro functional group. Structures with names 4- and 5-nitroimidazole are equivalent from the perspective of drugs since these tautomers readily interconvert. Drugs of the 5-nitro variety include metronidazole, tinidazole, nimorazole, dimetridazole, pretomanid, ornidazole, megazol, and azanidazole. Drugs based on 2-nitromidazoles include benznidazole. Nitroimidazole antibiotics have been used to combat anaerobic bacterial and parasitic infections. Perhaps the most common example is metronidazole. Other heterocycles such as nitrothiazoles (thiazole) are also used for this purpose. Nitroheterocycles may be reductively activated in hypoxic cells, and then undergo redox recycling or decompose to toxic products. References Disulfiram-like drugs
