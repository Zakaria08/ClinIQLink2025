        "title": "Status evaluation: enteroscopy.",
        "content": "Enteroscopy is a method to examine the small bowel mucosa beyond the reach of standard upper endoscopes. In practice it has primarily been used to search for a bleeding lesion in patients where one is not detected by conventional means. Such patients constitute only a small percentage of those who bleed (15,20). Experience is greatest with push enteroscopy. Examination of the distal duodenum and proximal jejunum using a standard or pediatric colonoscope is practical, appears to be safe and provides a satisfactory diagnostic and therapeutic yield in experienced hands. Longer designated push enteroscopes are under investigation. Sonde type enteroscopes can be passed to the ileum in most cases. A cause for bleeding can be detected in approximately one-quarter to one-third of individuals with minimal morbidity. Certain technical problems limit their efficacy and their role in the evaluation of patients with bleeding has not yet been clearly defined.",

        "content": "The catabolism of saturated fatty acids through beta-oxidation does not directly produce trans-alpha-beta unsaturated metabolites. Instead, the initial step of beta-oxidation creates a trans double bond between the alpha and beta carbons, which is then followed by further steps that ultimately lead to acetyl-CoA. 20.6 Stage II of Lipid Catabolism | The Basics of General ... Here's a more detailed explanation: Beta-oxidation: This is the main pathway for breaking down fatty acids in the body. It occurs in the mitochondria and involves a series of reactions that cleave two carbons from the fatty acid at a time. First step: The first step of beta-oxidation is the dehydrogenation of the fatty acid, which introduces a trans double bond between the alpha and beta carbons of the fatty acyl-CoA. This step is catalyzed by acyl-CoA dehydrogenase and produces trans-delta-2-enoyl-CoA. Subsequent steps: After the formation of the trans double bond, the fatty acid is then hydrated, oxidized, and cleaved to release acetyl-CoA and a shorter fatty acyl-CoA. No trans-alpha-beta unsaturated metabolites: While the initial step does create a trans double bond, the subsequent steps in beta-oxidation do not result in the accumulation of trans-alpha-beta unsaturated metabolites. The trans double bond is part of the overall process of breaking down the fatty acid, not a product that is formed. In summary, the catabolism of saturated fatty acids through beta-oxidation does involve the formation of a trans double bond initially, but the final products are acetyl-CoA and a shorter fatty acyl-CoA, not trans-alpha-beta unsaturated metabolites.",
