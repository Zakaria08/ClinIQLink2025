Document 1 (Title: Etomidate): Pharmacokinetics At the typical dose, anesthesia is induced for the duration of about 5–10 minutes, though the half-life of drug metabolism is about 75 minutes, because etomidate is redistributed from the plasma to other tissues. Onset of action: 30–60 seconds Peak effect: 1 minute Duration: 3–5 minutes; terminated by redistribution Distribution: Vd: 2–4.5 L/kg Protein binding: 76% Metabolism: Hepatic and plasma esterases Half-life distribution: 2.7 minutes Half-life redistribution: 29 minutes Half-life elimination: 2.9 to 5.3 hours Metabolism Etomidate is highly protein-bound in blood plasma and is metabolised by hepatic and plasma esterases to inactive products. It exhibits a biexponential decline.
Document 2 (Title: [Studies on buffalo milk. XI. Heterogeneity of the buffalo k-casein and the less moving fractions treated with 2-mercaptoethanol (author's transl)].): The heterogeneity of the buffalo k-casein, treated with 2-mercaptoethanol, has been estimated by disk gel-polyacrylamide electrophoresis on 428 caseins isolated from individual milks. The investigation showed six electrophoretic fractions: A, B, C, D, E, F, that, in ten buffalo farms considered formed ten different groups: ABCDEF; ABCDE; ABCEF; ABCE; BCDE; CDEF; BCE; CDE; CEF; and CE. The group ABCDE is the only that is present in all ten farms considered and presents on the whole, the greater number of observations (161). The fraction C is the most abundant. The investigation showed the heterogeneity of the gamma fraction, showing five electrophoretic fractions: A, B, C, D, E, that constitute the nine following groups; ABCDE; ABCD; BCDE; ABD; BCD; ABC; BD; BC and AB. At present a possible correlation to genetic factors seems hazardous.
Document 3 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): These opioids differ mainly in their potency and biodisposition. Sufentanil is five to seven times more potent than fentanyl. Alfentanil is considerably less potent than fentanyl, but acts more rapidly and has a markedly shorter duration of action. Remifentanil is metabolized very rapidly by blood and nonspecific tissue esterases, making its pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic half-lives extremely short. Such properties are useful when these compounds are used in anesthesia practice. Although fentanyl is now the predominant analgesic in the phenylpiperidine class, meperidine continues to be used. This older opioid has significant antimuscarinic effects, which may be a contraindication if tachycardia would be a problem. Meperidine is also reported to have a negative inotropic action on the heart. In addition, it has the potential for producing seizures secondary to accumulation of its metabolite, normeperidine, in patients receiving high doses or with concurrent renal failure. Given
