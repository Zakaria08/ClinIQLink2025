Document 1 (Title: The identification of related substances in triamcinolone acetonide by means of high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detector and mass spectrometry.): A study of an HPLC method for the analysis of related substances in triamcinolone acetonide is described. Several systems of solvents and samples of different lots and preparative origins were examined and a rapid-scanning diode array UV detector (DAD) was particularly useful. With the proposed technique it was possible to identify 9 alpha-bromo desonide as a principal impurity, which was present in all examined samples of triamcinolone acetonide. This identification was rendered possible by the investigation of the second derivative of the UV spectra and by means of study of the mass spectrum. Furthermore, it was possible, primarily on the basis of the spectrophotometric data, to formulate reliable hypotheses on the possible identification of 9 beta, 11 beta-epoxide of the desonide which was present at very low levels and to exclude the presence of 11-deoxy-9(11)-unsaturated desonide. The presence of the above-mentioned related substances was explained considering the scheme of synthesis described in the literature. The spectrophotometric characteristics of the studied compounds and the limits of applicability of the present procedure are discussed.
Document 2 (Title: Urinary Obstruction and Stasis   Kidney): The pressure within the renal pelvis is normally close to zero. When this pressure increases because of obstruction or reflux, the pelvis and calyces dilate. The degree of hydronephrosis that develops depends on the duration, degree, and site of the obstruction (Figure 12–4). The higher the obstruction, the greater the effect on the kidney. If the renal pelvis is entirely intrarenal and the obstruction is at the ureteropelvic junction, all the pressure will be exerted on the parenchyma (Klein et al., 2010). If the renal pelvis is extrarenal, only part of the pressure produced by a ureteropelvic stenosis is exerted on the parenchyma; this is because the extrarenal pelvis is embedded in fat and dilates more readily, thus "decompressing" the hydronephrotic left renal pelvis. Low density mass (P) in the left renal sinus had an attenuation value similar to that of water, suggesting the correct diagnosis. Unless intravenous contrast material is used, differentiation from a peripelvic cyst may be difficult. In the earlier stages, the renal pelvic musculature undergoes compensatory hypertrophy in its effort to force urine past the obstruction. Later, however, the muscle becomes stretched and atonic and decompensated. The progression of hydronephrotic atrophy is as follows (Chevalier, 2010; Rodriguez, 2004): 1. The earliest changes in the development of hydronephrosis are seen in the calyces. The end of a normal calyx is concave because of the papilla that projects into it; with increased intrapelvic pressure, the fornices become blunt and rounded. With persistence of increased intrapelvic pressure, the papilla becomes flattened, then convex (clubbed) as a result of compression enhanced by ischemic atrophy (Figure 12–5). The parenchyma between the calyces is affected to a lesser extent. The changes in the renal parenchyma are due to (a) compression atrophy from increased intrapelvic pressure (more accentuated with intrarenal pelves) and (b) ischemic atrophy from hemodynamic changes, mainly manifested in arcuate vessels that run at the base of the pyramids parallel to the kidney outline and are more vulnerable to compression between the renal capsule and the centrally increasing intrapelvic pressure. 2. This spotty atrophy is caused by the nature of the blood supply of the kidney. The arterioles are end arteries; therefore, ischemia is most marked in the areas farthest from the interlobular arteries. As the back pressure increases, hydronephrosis progresses, with the cells nearest the main arteries exhibiting the greatest resistance. 3. This increased pressure is transmitted up the tubules. The tubules become dilated, and their cells atrophy from ischemia. It should be pointed out that a few instances of dilated renal pelves and calyces are not due to the presence of obstruction. Rarely, the renal cavities are congenitally capacious and thus simulate hydronephrosis. More commonly, hydronephrosis may occur in childhood owing to the back pressure associated with vesicoureteral reflux. If the valvular incompetence resolves (and this is common), some degree of the hydronephrotic changes may persist. These persisting changes may cause the physician to suspect the presence of obstruction, which may lead to unnecessary surgery. A radioisotope renogram to assess ureteral drainage function can be performed to determine whether organic obstruction is present. 4. Only in unilateral hydronephrosis are the advanced stages of hydronephrotic atrophy seen. Eventually, the kidney is completely destroyed and appears as a thin walled sac filled with clear fluid (water and electrolytes) or pus (Figure 12–6).
Document 3 (Title: Dopamine beta-hydroxylase): Assays for DBH activity in human serum and Cerebrospinal fluid DBH activity in human serum could be estimated by a spectrophotometric method or with the aid of Ultra high performance liquid chromatography with Photo Diode Array detector (UHPLC-PDA). A sensitive assay for the detection of DBH activity in cerebrospinal fluid using High-performance liquid chromatography with Electrochemical detector(HPLC-ECD) was also described earlier. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) at DBH loci Genetic variants such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms(SNPs) at DBH loci were found to be associated with DBH activity and are well known expression quantitative trait loci. Allele variants at two regulatory SNPs namely rs1611115 and rs1989787 were shown to affect transcription of this gene. Mutations identified in Dopamine beta hydroxylase deficiency and non-synonymous SNPs such as rs6271 in this gene were found to cause defective secretion of the protein from the endoplasmic reticulum.
