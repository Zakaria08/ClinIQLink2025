With your own knowledge and the help of the following document:

Document 1 (Title: Constipation): Examination A physical examination should involve at least an abdominal exam and rectal exam. Abdominal exam may reveal an abdominal mass if there is significant stool burden and may reveal abdominal discomfort. Rectal examination gives an impression of the anal sphincter tone and whether the lower rectum contains any feces or not. Rectal examination also gives information on the consistency of the stool, the presence of hemorrhoids, blood and whether any perineal irregularities are present including skin tags, fissures, anal warts. Physical examination is done manually by a physician and is used to guide which diagnostic tests to order. Diagnostic tests Functional constipation is common and does not warrant diagnostic testing. Imaging and laboratory tests are typically recommended for those with alarm signs or symptoms.
Document 2 (Title: Comparison of Landolt C and Snellen E Acuity in Strabismus Amblyopia): Purpose: Assessment of visual acuity depends on the optotypes used for measurement. The ability to recognize different optotypes differs even if their critical detail appears under the same visual angle. Since optotypes are evaluated on individuals with good visual acuity and without eye disorders, differences in the lower visual acuity range cannot be excluded. In this study, visual acuity measured with the Snellen E was compared to the Landolt C acuity. Methods: 100 patients (age 8 90 years, median 60.5 years) with different eye disorders, among them 39 with amblyopia due to strabismus, and 13 healthy volunteers (age 18 33 years, median 24 years) were tested. Visual acuity assessment was performed using charts with the Snellen E and the Landolt C (Precision Vision) which mimic the ETDRS charts. 3 out of 5 optotypes per line had to be correctly identified, while wrong answers were monitored. In the group of patients, the eyes with the lower visual acuity, and for the healthy subjects, the right eyes were evaluated. Results: Differences between Landolt C (LR) and Snellen E (SE) acuity were small. The mean decimal values for LR and SE were 0.25±0.4 and 0.29±0.4 in the entire group and 0.14±0.8 and 0.16±0.8 for the eyes with strabismus amblyopia. The mean difference between LR and SE was 0.55 lines in the entire group and 0.55 lines for the eyes with strabismus amblyopia, with higher values for the Snellen E in both groups. In the acuity range below 0.1, the mean difference between LR and SE was 0.58 lines for the entire group and 0.58 lines for the eyes with strabismic amblyopia with higher values for the Snellen E in both groups. Conclusions: Using the charts described, there was only a slight overestimation of visual acuity by the Snellen E compared to the Landolt C, even in strabismus amblyopia. Small differences in the lower visual acuity range have to be considered.
Document 3 (Title: Gynecology_Novak): 1. The perianal and perineal regions are common sites for itching. Pruritus ani is usually indicated by thickening, excoriations, and eczema of the perianal region and adjacent areas. 2. The anal opening often is the site of fissures, fistulae, and external hemorrhoids. 3. The pilonidal area may present a dimple, a sinus, or an inﬂamed pilonidal cyst. 2. Instruct the patient to “strain down” and note whether this technique brings into view previously concealed internal hemorrhoids, polyps, or a prolapsed rectal mucosa. 3. Palpate the pilonidal area, the ischiorectal fossa, the perineum, and the perianal region before inserting the gloved finger into the anal canal. Note the presence of any concealed induration or tenderness in any of these areas. 4.
