Document 1 (Title: Dopamine beta-hydroxylase): Assays for DBH activity in human serum and Cerebrospinal fluid DBH activity in human serum could be estimated by a spectrophotometric method or with the aid of Ultra high performance liquid chromatography with Photo Diode Array detector (UHPLC-PDA). A sensitive assay for the detection of DBH activity in cerebrospinal fluid using High-performance liquid chromatography with Electrochemical detector(HPLC-ECD) was also described earlier. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) at DBH loci Genetic variants such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms(SNPs) at DBH loci were found to be associated with DBH activity and are well known expression quantitative trait loci. Allele variants at two regulatory SNPs namely rs1611115 and rs1989787 were shown to affect transcription of this gene. Mutations identified in Dopamine beta hydroxylase deficiency and non-synonymous SNPs such as rs6271 in this gene were found to cause defective secretion of the protein from the endoplasmic reticulum.
Document 2 (Title: Chromatography -- Introduction -- High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC)): This is a highly sensitive and efficient technique among different chromatography techniques, also known as high-pressure liquid chromatography. [1] Here, the solvent mixture can pass through columns containing stationary phases under high atmospheric pressure of 10 Pa to 400 Pa. This high pressure creates a high flow rate in a sample of 0.1 cm/sec to 5 cm/sec, allowing separation in a few minutes. High pressure ensures high resolution and better separation of closely related compounds; it also enables using MS as detectors, which require high flow rates. [4] The eluents are detected using UV absorption and fluorescence. The basic instrumentation setup is given in image 3.
Document 3 (Title: The identification of related substances in triamcinolone acetonide by means of high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detector and mass spectrometry.): A study of an HPLC method for the analysis of related substances in triamcinolone acetonide is described. Several systems of solvents and samples of different lots and preparative origins were examined and a rapid-scanning diode array UV detector (DAD) was particularly useful. With the proposed technique it was possible to identify 9 alpha-bromo desonide as a principal impurity, which was present in all examined samples of triamcinolone acetonide. This identification was rendered possible by the investigation of the second derivative of the UV spectra and by means of study of the mass spectrum. Furthermore, it was possible, primarily on the basis of the spectrophotometric data, to formulate reliable hypotheses on the possible identification of 9 beta, 11 beta-epoxide of the desonide which was present at very low levels and to exclude the presence of 11-deoxy-9(11)-unsaturated desonide. The presence of the above-mentioned related substances was explained considering the scheme of synthesis described in the literature. The spectrophotometric characteristics of the studied compounds and the limits of applicability of the present procedure are discussed.
Document 4 (Title: Biochemistry_Lippinco): the chromatography column by eluting with solutions of increasing ionic strength and pH (Fig. 2.3). The separated amino acids contained in the eluate from the column are quantitated by heating them with ninhydrin (a reagent that forms a purple compound with most amino acids, ammonia, and amines). The amount of each amino acid is determined spectrophotometrically by measuring the amount of light absorbed by the ninhydrin derivative. The analysis described above is performed using an amino acid analyzer, an automated machine whose components are depicted in Figure 2.3.
Document 5 (Title: Beta2 Receptor Agonists and Antagonists -- Monitoring): The plasma concentration of B2 agonists correlates with the severity of the toxicity. Direct monitoring of B2 agonists is not a regular procedure in clinical practice, as their efficacy and toxicity can be measured clinically or by using indirect tests. Nevertheless, there are some recognized tests for measuring drug concentration in the bloodstream, such as gas chromatography or liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry, high-performance liquid chromatography, fluorimetric detectors, and electrochemical detectors. Monitoring techniques are primarily used before athletic competitions to check for their use as anabolic agents. [5] Clinically, serum potassium and blood glucose require regular monitoring to manage any adverse effects early. The recurrence of asthma attacks is not an indicator of the efficacy of B2 agonists, as the main drug responsible for long-term effects is steroids.
Document 6 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Several systems use substrates for preformed bacterial enzymes for identification within 2–3 h. These systems do not rely on bacterial growth per se to determine whether a substrate has been used. They employ a heavy inoculum in which specific bacterial enzymes are present in amounts sufficient to convert substrate to product rapidly. In addition, some systems use fluorogenic substrate/endproduct detection methods to increase sensitivity through signal amplification. Gas-Liquid Chromatography Gas-liquid chromatography often is used to detect metabolic end products of bacterial fermentation. One common application is identification of short-chain fatty acids produced by obligate anaerobes during glucose fermentation. Because the types and relative concentrations of volatile acids differ among the various genera and species that make up this group of organisms, such information serves as a metabolic fingerprint for a particular isolate.
Document 7 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): is a common comorbid condition. On the other hand, if the continu-ous monitoring capacity afforded by these monitors can provide usable trend data, that may still provide clinical utility despite less accuracy at low hemoglobin levels. To date, there have been relatively few studies validating the trending capacity of noninvasive Hgb monitoring compared to serial blood draws, with limited agreement due to differences in analysis and study design.65 Further studies are required to evaluate the clinical utility of this potentially useful technology.CapnometryCapnometry is the measurement of carbon dioxide in the airway throughout the respiratory cycle. Capnometry is most commonly measured by infrared light absorption. CO2 absorbs infrared light at a peak wavelength of approximately 4.27 µm. Capnom-etry works by passing infrared light through a sample chamber to a detector on the opposite side. More infrared light passing through the sample chamber (i.e., less CO2) causes a larger
Document 8 (Title: Chromatography -- Testing Procedures): 5 . Detection and interpretation: In column chromatography, as the solute migrates through the entire system and emerges from the column, the detectors continuously monitor the emerging mobile phase called the eluate and transmit signals in the form of voltage recorded on the chromatograph. Some of the detectors used in chromatography are mass spectrometry, refractive index, electrochemical, ultraviolet, flame ionization, electron capture, and fluorescence detectors. [25] Among these, ultraviolet detectors are the most commonly used in clinical laboratories.
Document 9 (Title: Gas chromatography ion detector): Types of Ion Detectors Flame ionization detector (FID) -- uses a flame to produce ions Electron capture detector (ECD) -- uses beta radiation Photo-ionization detector (PID) -- uses UV light to produce ions Helium ionization detector (HID) -- uses a radioactive source to produce helium ions, which in turn ionize the components Discharge ionization detector (DID) -- uses an electric spark source to produce helium ions, which in turn ionize the components Pulsed discharge ionization detector (PDD) -- similar to a Discharge ionization detector (DID), but uses a different sort of spark References See also Gas Chromatograph Chromatography detector Gas chromatography
Document 10 (Title: [Determination of acetylsalicylic and salicylic acid in tablets using high-performance liquid chromatography and a diode array detector].): A fast and sensitive method of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) for determination of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and products of salicylic acid (SA) hydrolysis in tablets has been elaborated. Extraction was done with the mixture of methanol: formic acid (98:2 v/v) and separation of the components was achieved by using the colon of Ultropac Lichrosorb RP-18, 10 um, 4 cm x 250 mm and diode array detector. The mobile phase of methanol:water: :mol/1 H3PO4 (60:35:5) v/v, pP = 2.6 and safe flow of 1 ml/min were used. Follow up of chromatographic separation of ASA, SA and internal standard beta-naphtole (ITS) was performed at the wave length of 290 microns. The threshold of ASA was 0.5 mg/ml and of SA 0.0025 mg/ml.
Document 11 (Title: Determination of nalbuphine using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to photodiode-array detection and gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry.): A procedure involving capillary column gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry and a method involving liquid chromatography coupled to a diode-array detector have been developed for the analysis of nalbuphine. The extraction step is the same for both techniques and involves extraction under alkaline conditions in chloroform-2-propanol-n-heptane (50:17:33, v/v/v) with levallorphan as the internal standard. After purification by acidic extraction and back alkaline extraction, drugs are derivatized with N,O-bis-(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide with 1% trimethylchlorosilane for gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and directly injected for high-performance liquid chromatography-diode-array detection. The limits of detection are 2.0 and 25.0 ng/mg, respectively.
Document 12 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): µm. Capnom-etry works by passing infrared light through a sample chamber to a detector on the opposite side. More infrared light passing through the sample chamber (i.e., less CO2) causes a larger sig-nal in the detector relative to the infrared light passing through a reference cell. Capnometric determination of the partial pressure of CO2 in end-tidal exhaled gas (Petco2) is used as a surrogate for the partial pressure of CO2 in arterial blood (Paco2) during mechanical ventilation. In healthy subjects, Petco2 is about 1 to 5 mmHg less than Paco2.66 Thus, Petco2 can be used to estimate Paco2 without the need for blood gas determination. However, changes in Petco2 may not correlate with changes in Paco2 dur-ing a number of pathologic conditions.Capnography allows the confirmation of endotracheal intubation and continuous assessment of ventilation, integrity of the airway, operation of the ventilator, and cardiopulmonary function. Capnometers are configured with either an inline
Document 13 (Title: Chromatographic and spectrophotometric characterization of adducts formed during the reaction of trans,trans-muconaldehyde with 14C-deoxyguanosine 5'-phosphate.): Mice liver microsomes oxidatively open the benzene ring to form trans,trans-muconaldehyde, a hematotoxic unsaturated aldehyde. In the present studies, 4.5 mumole trans,trans-muconaldehyde was reacted with 14C-2'deoxyguanosine 5'-phosphate in phosphate buffer. Products were separated by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Absorbance was monitored using a diode array detector, and aliquots of the HPLC eluant were collected for UV spectrophotometric analysis and scintillation counting. Under these conditions, deoxyguanosine 5'-phosphate eluted at 12.5 min and muconaldehyde at 22.0 min. The HPLC and radioactivity profiles of the muconaldehyde/deoxyguanosine reaction mixture indicated the presence of multiple adducts. Three adducts were detected eluting at 36, 39, and 42 min, which represented approximately 2.5, 2.5, and 1% of the radioactivity, respectively. These adducts had similar UV spectra with absorption maxima between 334 and 347 nm. Another product of the reaction mixture, eluting at 19.0 min and accounting for 10% of the radioactivity, was also observed. This compound had absorption maxima at 348 and 372 nm. These results suggest that trans,trans-muconaldehyde can react with deoxyguanosine monophosphate in vitro under physiological conditions to form stable adducts. Studies are being conducted to determine the structure of these adducts and whether these adducts are formed by the reaction of DNA with muconaldehyde or metabolically activated benzene.
Document 14 (Title: Gas chromatography): Flame photometric detector (FPD) uses a photomultiplier tube to detect spectral lines of the compounds as they are burned in a flame. Compounds eluting off the column are carried into a hydrogen fueled flame which excites specific elements in the molecules, and the excited elements (P,S, Halogens, Some Metals) emit light of specific characteristic wavelengths. The emitted light is filtered and detected by a photomultiplier tube. In particular, phosphorus emission is around 510–536 nm and sulfur emission is at 394 nm. With an atomic emission detector (AED), a sample eluting from a column enters a chamber which is energized by microwaves that induce a plasma. The plasma causes the analyte sample to decompose and certain elements generate an atomic emission spectra. The atomic emission spectra is diffracted by a diffraction grating and detected by a series of photomultiplier tubes or photo diodes.
Document 15 (Title: Chromatography -- Diagnostic Tests): M. Tswett was the first to perform chromatography on plant pigments in 1906 using calcium carbonate as a stationary phase. Over time, thin-layer chromatography, gas chromatography, and HPLC were applied. Now, ultra HPLC, two-dimensional GC with full automation, and an advanced detector system are in use. [4] Since then, chromatography has evolved and found its application in many fields, such as analytical chemistry, clinical diagnostics, forensics, food science, pharmacology, and molecular biology.
