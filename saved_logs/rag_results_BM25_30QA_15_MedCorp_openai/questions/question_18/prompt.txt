Document 1 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): 982 Listeria monocytogenes Infections Elizabeth L. Hohmann, Daniel A. Portnoy Listeria monocytogenes is a food-borne pathogen that can cause serious infections, particularly in pregnant women and immunocompromised 176 individuals. A ubiquitous saprophytic environmental bacterium, L. monocytogenes is also a facultative intracellular pathogen with a broad host range. Humans are probably accidental hosts for this microorganism. L. monocytogenes is of interest not only to clinicians but also to basic scientists as a model intracellular pathogen that is used to study basic mechanisms of microbial pathogenesis and host immunity. L. monocytogenes is a facultatively anaerobic, nonsporulating, gram-positive rod that grows over a broad temperature range, including refrigeration temperatures. This organism is motile during growth at low temperatures but much less so at 37°C. The vast majority of cases of human listerial disease can be traced to serotypes 1/2a, 1/2b, and 4.
Document 2 (Title: Growth of Listeria monocytogenes Scott A, serotype 4 and competitive spoilage organisms in raw chicken packaged under modified atmospheres and in air.): The development of Listeria monocytogenes Scott A, serotype 4 and aerobic plate counts on minced raw chicken were determined independently at 4, 10 and 27 degrees C. Samples were packaged in flexible film under two modified atmospheres (one containing oxygen and one containing no oxygen) or air. The anaerobic modified atmosphere (75:25, CO2:N2) resulted in the failure of both the aerobic plate counts and L. monocytogenes to grow at all temperatures. Both the L. monocytogenes and aerobic plate counts grew in air at all temperatures. The aerobic modified atmosphere (72.5:22.5:5, CO2:N2:O2), which more closely duplicates commercial practice, inhibited the increase in aerobic plate counts by more than 4 log10 cfu/g compared to air at 4 degrees C. However, the L. monocytogenes was not affected by this atmosphere and increased in numbers by nearly 6 log10 cfu/g at 4 degrees C in 21 days. Regression analysis of the log10 growth and 95% confidence intervals showed that the differences between aerobic plate counts and L. monocytogenes in modified atmosphere were large. The ability of L. monocytogenes to grow in the aerobic modified atmosphere was not affected by level of the L. monocytogenes inoculum nor by the initial level of aerobic plate counts. These data show that modified atmosphere packaging of raw chicken (and probably other meats) can substantially inhibit the aerobic spoilage flora while allowing pathogenic L. monocytogenes to increase.
Document 3 (Title: Listeria monocytogenes): The Anton test is used in the identification of L. monocytogenes; instillation of a culture into the conjunctival sac of a rabbit or guinea pig causes severe keratoconjunctivitis within 24 hours. Listeria species grow on media such as Mueller-Hinton agar. Identification is enhanced if the primary cultures are done on agar containing sheep blood, because the characteristic small zone of hemolysis can be observed around and under colonies. Isolation can be enhanced if the tissue is kept at 4 °C for some days before inoculation into bacteriologic media. The organism is a facultative anaerobe and is catalase-positive and motile. Listeria produces acid, but not gas, when fermenting a variety of carbohydrates. The motility at room temperature and hemolysin production are primary findings that help differentiate Listeria from Corynebacterium.
Document 4 (Title: Listeria Monocytogenes -- Etiology): Listeria commonly causes meningitis in the young (neonates), elderly, and immunocompromised patient population. Healthy individuals infected with L. monocytogenes typically have a self-limiting gastrointestinal infection with fever and diarrhea. The Listeria family consists of 10 different species with L. monocytogenes found most consistently in humans. L. monocytogenes has 13 different serotypes based on a variety of flagellar and surface antigens.  However, there are only three serotypes (1/2a, 1/2b, 4a) that inflict disease in humans. [3] In general, the infectious dose of L. monocytogenes is large, meaning one must ingest a large number to cause clinical infection, but as growth and division can continue at refrigerator temperatures, these levels can be reached despite typical food storage precautions. Host immune response also affects the infectious dose. Utilization of proton pump inhibitors or other stomach acid suppression modalities makes it easier for L. monocytogenes to pass through the stomach and invade enterocytes.
Document 5 (Title: Listeria monocytogenes): Routes of infection Listeria monocytogenes has been associated with such foods as raw milk, pasteurized fluid milk, cheeses (particularly soft-ripened varieties), hard-boiled eggs, ice cream, raw vegetables, fermented raw-meat sausages, raw and cooked poultry, raw meats (of all types), and raw and smoked fish. Most bacteria can survive near freezing temperatures, but cannot absorb nutrients, grow or replicate; however, L. monocytogenes has the ability to grow at temperatures as low as 0 °C which permits exponential multiplication in refrigerated foods. At refrigeration temperature, such as 4 °C, the amount of ferric iron can affect the growth of L. monocytogenes. Infectious cycle
Document 6 (Title: Roles of Listeria monocytogenes virulence factors in survival: virulence factors distinct from listeriolysin are needed for the organism to survive an early neutrophil-mediated host defense mechanism.): Avirulent mutant strains of Listeria monocytogenes which fail to produce phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C, or which produce reduced amounts of hemolytic listeriolysin O, are incapable of causing progressive infection in normal mice. However, both strains can grow progressively in mice that have been rendered incapable of focusing neutrophils at sites of infection as a result of being treated with monoclonal antibody 5C6, specific for the type 3 complement receptor of myelomonocytic cells. In 5C6-treated mice, phospholipase C-negative and listeriolysin-defective mutant strains of L. monocytogenes, like the wild-type strain, give rise in the liver to large numbers of discrete foci of infected hepatocytes that retain their morphological integrity during the first 24 h, despite their large bacterial burden. In normal mice, in contrast, sites of infection in the liver are indicated by discrete focal accumulations of neutrophils that occupy the space originally occupied by infected hepatocytes. It is apparent that in normal mice neutrophils function to lyse infected hepatocytes and thereby to release L. monocytogenes for ingestion and killing by neutrophils themselves and by macrophages. However, whereas a proportion of wild-type organisms survive this early mechanism of defense to give rise to progressive infection, the phospholipase C-negative organisms are totally eliminated. On the basis of these and other results, it is suggested that virulence factors other than listeriolysin are needed by L. monocytogenes to counteract the early neutrophil-mediated mechanism of defense. Listeriolysin, itself, is an intrinsic virulence factor that allows L. monocytogenes to survive and multiply in a proportion of the fixed phagocytes of the liver (permissive phagocytes) and which enables the organism to go on to infect and replicate in adjacent hepatocytes. It was found that a mutant strain of L. monocytogenes incapable of producing any listeriolysin was incapable of establishing progressive infection, even in 5C6-treated mice.
Document 7 (Title: Listeriosis): Central nervous system (CNS) infection: Listeria has a predilection for the brain parenchyma, especially the brain stem, and the meninges. It can cause cranial nerve palsies, encephalitis, meningitis, meningoencephalitis and abscesses. Mental status changes are common. Seizures occur in at least 25% of patients. Gastroenteritis: L. monocytogenes can produce food-borne diarrheal disease, which typically is noninvasive. The median incubation period is 21 days, with diarrhea lasting anywhere from 1–3 days. Affected people present with fever, muscle aches, gastrointestinal nausea or diarrhea, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance, or convulsions.
Document 8 (Title: Fever in a Neonate -- Treatment / Management): The ill-appearing neonate requires a full septic work and broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage with ampicillin and cefotaxime, the combination of which covers 100% of early neonatal infections and 93% of late-onset bacteremia. Gentamicin and penicillin can cover 94% of early infections. [9] Cefotaxime does not treat some Escherichia coli , Pseudomonas , Enterococci , Acinetobacter, and Listeria monocytogenes . Use of Cefotaxime in the NICU can cause outbreaks of drug-resistant nosocomial infections, which is a serious concern in many centers. Pediatric Infectious diseases specialists consider empiric treatment of neonatal herpes with Intravenous Acyclovir if the CSF has an elevated red cell count or in any ill-looking neonate with suspected herpes. [10] We admit and empirically treat ill-looking infants and infants with risk factors while waiting for the cultures.
Document 9 (Title: Bacterial Meningitis -- Etiology): Listeria monocytogenes and gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli , Klebsiella , Enterobacter , Pseudomonas aeruginosa are other less common causes. Hemophilus influenzae is still occasionally encountered in nonvaccinated individuals. Nosocomial infections are caused by S. pneumonia , Staphylococcus aureus , Staphylococcus albus , and gram-negative bacilli. As per Thigpen etal. out of the 1670 cases reported in the U.S. during 2003–2007, S. pneumoniae was the predominant infective species (58.0%), followed by GBS (18.1%), N. meningitidis (13.9%), H. influenzae (6.7%), and L. monocytogenes (3.4%). [4] Infectious meningitis may also be caused by viruses, fungi, and protozoa. Meningitis may also be non-infectious in etiology and can be caused by cancer, medications, or inflammatory conditions. [5] [6]
Document 10 (Title: [Early onset neonatal septicemia caused by Listeria monocytogenes].): Listeria monocytogenes can cause sepsis and meningitis during the neonatal period. Six cases of early onset neonatal sepsis caused by Listeria monocytogenes are reported here. These cases were diagnosed in a private hospital at Santiago, Chile from December 1984 throughout November 1986. The incidence rate was 1.4 x 1,000 liveborns. Clinical findings included prematurity (6), meconium stained amniotic fluid (6), hepatomegaly (6), splenomegaly (6), maculopapular exanthem (4), anal prolapse (3) and meningitis (1). Additionally 5 patients developed respiratory distress and 4 required ventilatory support. Overall mortality was 50% (3/6). All deaths were related to respiratory failure and occurred during the first week of disease. All patients received ampicillin and amikacin early in the course of their infection. Listeriosis of the newborn infant might be preventable by prompt recognition and treatment of maternal infections. Since Listeria infection in pregnancy is usually mild and symptoms and signs are nonspecific, prevention may be difficult. Pregnant women with fever of no clear origin or with an influenza like syndrome should be screened for listeriosis with cultures from blood, vagina and cervix samples.
Document 11 (Title: Listeria Monocytogenes -- Pathophysiology): L. monocytogenes can grow at refrigerator temperatures.  Low temperatures induce enzymes such as RNA helicase which improves L. monocytogenes’ activity and replication at low temperatures. The ability to produce biofilms enhances L. monocytogenes ability to survive harsh environments. L. monocytogenes also utilizes flagella at lower temperatures. This mechanism enables the ability to propel itself and latch onto enterocytes early in infection, but eventually losing the flagella the longer the bacteria is exposed to higher temperatures.
Document 12 (Title: Precise prediction of a dominant class I MHC-restricted epitope of Listeria monocytogenes.): Listeria monocytogenes is a Gram-positive bacterium which grows in the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells and can cause severe disease in immunocompromised individuals. In murine systems CD8+ T lymphocytes have been shown to be important effectors of acquired protective immunity against L. monocytogenes. Class I MHC-restricted CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), which lyse J774 macrophage-like targets infected with L. monocytogenes, are induced following in vivo injection of live organisms. Natural peptide epitopes derived from L. monocytogenes can be acid-extracted from heavily infected BALB/c spleens and detected by CTL. A CTL clone, B9, derived from a (BALB/c x C57BL/6)F1 (H-2dxb) mouse, recognizes one of these natural epitopes in an H-2Kd-restricted fashion. B9 also recognizes P815 (H-2d) mastocytoma cells transfected with the listeriolysin gene. To identify the region of the listeriolysin recognized by CTL we used the H-2Kd peptide-binding motif described by Rammensee and colleagues to synthesize 11 nonamer peptides. One of these peptides, listeriolysin 91-99, was recognized very efficiently by B9. This represents the first identified class I MHC-restricted epitope of bacteria and demonstrates the utility of the allele-specific motif for predicting CTL epitopes.
Document 13 (Title: Physiology, Neuromuscular Transmission -- Pathophysiology -- Botulism): Botulism is a potentially fatal syndrome of diffuse, flaccid paralysis caused by neurotoxins produced caused by Clostridium botulinum, an anaerobic gram-positive, spore-forming bacterium. Of the several types of neurotoxins produced by C. botulinum toxins B, D, F, and G selectively affect one or all of these SNARE proteins and block docking, a fusion of SVs and exocytosis of Ach, resulting in muscle weakness or reversible flaccid paralysis. Botulism can be foodborne. In adults, ingestion of food contaminated with spores or toxins (home-canned food) of clostridium botulism result in nausea, vomiting, blurred vision, diplopia, and descending flaccid paralysis. In severe cases, bulbar paralysis and respiratory failure may occur rapidly. Infant botulism can occur due to ingestion of honey contaminated with spores of C. botulism. Toxins are produced within the GI tract of infants, and infants present with constipation, weak feeding, weak crying, and flaccid paralysis. History, clinical presentation, and the detection of botulinum toxin and the presence of C. botulinum in serum, stool, gastrointestinal content, or wound exudates form the basis of diagnosis. Treatment is done by administering antitoxin. Early administration of antitoxin decreases mortality and shortens the disease course. Patients may require prolonged periods of ventilation. Botulism can also occur due to contamination of a wound with dust containing C. botulism spores. Such infection particularly common after traumatic injuries and among drug abusers. Therapeutically, botulinum toxin is used to treat spasticity in conditions such as blepharospasm, torticollis, anal sphincter spasm, etc. It is also used to treat axillary hyperhidrosis and cosmetically used to correct wrinkles.

Document 14 (Title: Behavior of Listeria monocytogenes in wiener exudates in the presence of Pediococcus acidilactici H or pediocin AcH during storage at 4 or 25 degrees C.): Exudative fluids were collected from packages of five brands of all-beef wieners and inoculated to contain 10(4) to 10(5) CFU of a three-strain (Scott A, V7, and 101M) mixture of Listeria monocytogenes per ml. Listeriae were inactivated (decrease of 0.61 to 3.8 log10 CFU/ml) in all five exudates held at 4 degrees C for 29 days. L. monocytogenes grew (increase of 1.7 to 3.6 log10 CFU/ml) in two of five exudates held at 25 degrees C for 6 days. Exudate was inoculated with a derivative of Pediococcus acidilactici H (designated JBL1095) or treated with pediocin AcH (a bacteriocin) as a novel approach to control the growth of L. monocytogenes in wiener exudates. Initially, pediocin AcH caused rapid death (decrease of 0.74 log10 CFU/ml in 2 h) of L. monocytogenes in exudate held at 4 degrees C, but thereafter the inactivation was similar to that in control exudate (L. monocytogenes only) or exudate containing L. monocytogenes plus JBL1095. At 25 degrees C, L. monocytogenes grew in the presence of JBL1095 during the first 64 h of incubation, but thereafter the numbers of the pathogen decreased appreciably (5.84 log10 CFU/ml in 3 days). In the presence of pediocin AcH, there was a gradual decrease in numbers of L. monocytogenes throughout the storage period at 25 degrees C. These data indicate that added biopreservatives can potentiate and amplify the intrinsic listeriostatic or listericidal activity of wiener exudate.
Document 15 (Title: Listeria monocytogenes): Listeria monocytogenes is the species of pathogenic bacteria that causes the infection listeriosis. It is a facultative anaerobic bacterium, capable of surviving in the presence or absence of oxygen. It can grow and reproduce inside the host's cells and is one of the most virulent foodborne pathogens: 20 to 30% of foodborne listeriosis infections in high-risk individuals may be fatal. Responsible for an estimated 1,600 illnesses and 260 deaths in the United States annually, listeriosis ranks third in total number of deaths among foodborne bacterial pathogens, with fatality rates exceeding even Salmonella spp. and Clostridium botulinum. In the European Union, listeriosis follows an upward trend that began in 2008, causing 2,161 confirmed cases and 210 reported deaths in 2014, 16% more than in 2013. Listeriosis mortality rates are also higher in the EU than for other foodborne pathogens.
