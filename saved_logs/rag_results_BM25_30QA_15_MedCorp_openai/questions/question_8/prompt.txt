Document 3 (Title: Vitamin B6 in clinical neurology.): Many conditions in clinical neurology may be responsive to pyridoxine as a therapeutic agent. The current difficulty is in trying to isolate the conditions that are most likely to respond. Treating seizures is a major part of a neurologic practice. Our current therapeutic agents are only partially successful and limited by multiple side effects. One problem is that patients often have to take these agents for an entire lifetime, further raising the risk of toxicity. If pyridoxine supplementation can improve the efficacy of currently used medications, it will be gladly accepted into our therapeutic arsenal. Headache, chronic pain, and depression all appear to run together in many of our patients. The observations that serotonin deficiency is a common thread between them and that pyridoxine can raise serotonin levels open a wide range of therapeutic options. Small studies have been carried out with mixed success. Comparison with amitriptyline in the treatment of headache appears to show about equal efficacy, although side effects would be expected to be more of a problem with the amitriptyline. Behavioral disorders are relatively common and continue to be a major problem, disrupting the lives of the patients and their families. Current treatments are not acceptable to most people because of the risk of side effects with long-term usage. If, as Dr. Feingold suggests, many of these problems are caused by "toxic" exposures to chemicals that are pyridoxine antagonists, supplementation at early ages may reduce the incidence of hyperactivity and aggressive behavior. This raises the question of safety. Is pyridoxine safe for long-term use in large segments of the population, including children? The studies on children with Down's syndrome and autism, utilizing much higher doses than are used for other therapeutic purposes, seem to indicate relative safety if carefully monitored. Studies involving large population groups with carpal tunnel syndrome, all adults, using 100-150 mg/day have shown minimal or no toxicity in five- to 10-year studies. Women self-medicating for PMS taking 500 to 5000 mg/day have shown peripheral neuropathy within one to three years. It would appear from this retrospective analysis that pyridoxine is safe at doses of 100 mg/day or less in adults. In children there is not enough data to make any sort of suggestion. Because the major neurologic complication is a peripheral neuropathy and the causes of this condition are myriad, pyridoxine may cause neuropathy only in patients with a pre-existing susceptibility to this condition.
Document 4 (Title: Tramadol): Dependence and withdrawal Long-term use of high doses of tramadol causes physical dependence and withdrawal syndrome. These include both symptoms typical of opioid withdrawal and those associated with serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) withdrawal; symptoms include numbness, tingling, paresthesia, and tinnitus. Psychiatric symptoms may include hallucinations, paranoia, extreme anxiety, panic attacks, and confusion. In most cases, tramadol withdrawal will set in 12–20 hours after the last dose, but this can vary. Tramadol withdrawal typically lasts longer than that of other opioids. Seven days or more of acute withdrawal symptoms can occur as opposed to typically 3 or 4 days for other codeine analogues. Overdose Recognised risk factors for tramadol overdose include respiratory depression, addiction, and seizures. Naloxone only partially reverses the toxic effects of tramadol overdose and may increase the risk of seizures.
Document 5 (Title: Amitriptyline): Amitriptiline counteracts the antihypertensive action of guanethidine. When given with amitriptyline, other anticholinergic agents may result in hyperpyrexia or paralytic ileus. Co-administration of amitriptyline and disulfiram is not recommended due to the potential for the development of toxic delirium. Amitriptyline causes an unusual type of interaction with the anticoagulant phenprocoumon during which great fluctuations of the prothrombin time have been observed. Pharmacology Pharmacodynamics Amitriptyline inhibits serotonin transporter (SERT) and norepinephrine transporter (NET). It is metabolized to nortriptyline, a stronger norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, further augmenting amitriptyline's effects on norepinephrine reuptake (see the Table on the right). Amitriptyline additionally acts as a potent inhibitor of the serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, the α1A-adrenergic, the histamine H1 and the M1-M5 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (see the Table on the right).
Document 6 (Title: Prognosis of the Lennox syndrome-long-term clinical and electroencephalographic follow-up study, especially with special reference to relationship with the West syndrome.): The long-term clinical and electroencephalographic follow-up studies were carried out for more than three years, up to 14 years in the longest, on 116 cases with Lennox syndrome. And the results of s-ystematic study on changing patterns and out come have been reported. The follow-up examination was performed also on West syndrome which is closely related with Lennox syndrome; especially the relationship between both syndromes regarding prognosis has been clarified. (1) According to the long-term follow-up on 116 cases with Lennox syndrome, there were 98 cases (84.5%) having mes (61.2%) and persisted as Lennox syndrome except for one case. (2) Generally speaking, the cases with age of onset before two years old showed unfavorable outcome. (3) There were 42 cases (36.2%), which were converted from West syndrome and showed markedly unfaborable prognosis in regard to intelligence as well as the remainging of seizure. (31 cases, 77.5%) (4) On thehand, in 23 idiopathic cases, which showed no developmental retardation before onset of seizure, had favorable outcome, and the remaining of seizure was observed in eight cases (34.8%). However, even in such cases, it was noticed that those displaying mental defect at the follow-up attained 14 cases (60.9%). That is to say, it was clarified that persistence of even minor seizures induced mental deterioration. (5) The cases with favorable prognosis showed usually a typical slow spike-and-wave pattern electroencephalographically, whereas those with poor prognosis showed mostly an asymmetric or disorganized slow spike-and-wave pattern. (6) In many cases displaying signs of brain atrophy with pneumoencephalograpm and accompanying overt neurological signs at the initial examination, prognosis is obviously poor. (7) From the follow-up examination on 94 cases with West syndrome for three to 15 years transformed into Lennox syndrome Among them, those cases with the remaining of seizure at the time of follow-up were 44 (46.8%) out 94 cases, of which 37 cases (83.8%) had remaining seizure as Lennox syndrome. (8) From the above results, it is emphasized that Lennox and West syndromes show close relationship with each other and that a study should be done on the interrelation between their prognosis.
Document 7 (Title: Cardiovascular (ECG and systolic time intervals) and anticholinergic effects of repeated doses of femoxetine--a comparison with amitriptyline and placebo in healthy men.): 1. The cardiovascular and anticholinergic effects of femoxetine and amitriptyline were compared with those of placebo in a double-blind cross-over trial in 12 healthy men. The daily doses administered were therapeutic: 600 mg femoxetine and 150 mg amitriptyline. Duration of treatment with each drug was 13 days. 2. The statistically significant effects on systolic time intervals and ECG comprised a larger decrease of QS2 index during femoxetine than during amitriptyline, and an increase of PEP/LVET ratio and QRS duration by amitriptyline. These results suggest that femoxetine and, to a lesser extent, amitriptyline increase contractility compared with placebo, and amitriptyline, but not femoxetine, causes delay in intracardiac conduction. 3. The effects of amitriptyline on the systolic time intervals are difficult to interpret because of the changes in heart rate and intracardiac electrical conduction caused by the drug. These problems of interpretation are discussed. 4. No significant changes in blood pressure were observed. The heart rate during both femoxetine and amitriptyline periods was significantly faster than during the placebo period, amitriptyline causing a significantly greater increase. 5. Salivary secretion was decreased more by amitriptyline (26%) than by femoxetine (8%), the latter being not significantly different from placebo. Femoxetine tended to increase pupil diameter and amitriptyline to increase accommodation near point, but no visual disturbances were reported on any treatment. Symptoms such as dry mouth, constipation and sedation were significantly less frequently reported during femoxetine than during amitriptyline treatment.
Document 8 (Title: Cyclophosphamide): This risk may be dependent on dose and other factors, including the condition, other agents or treatment modalities (including radiotherapy), treatment length and intensity. For some regimens, it is rare. For instance, CMF-therapy for breast cancer (where the cumulative dose is typically less than 20 grams of cyclophosphamide) carries an AML risk of less than 1/2000, with some studies finding no increased risk compared to background. Other treatment regimens involving higher doses may carry risks of 1–2% or higher. Cyclophosphamide-induced AML, when it happens, typically presents some years after treatment, with incidence peaking around 3–9 years. After nine years, the risk falls to background. When AML occurs, it is often preceded by a myelodysplastic syndrome phase, before developing into overt acute leukemia. Cyclophosphamide-induced leukemia will often involve complex cytogenetics, which carries a worse prognosis than de novo AML.

Document 10 (Title: Effects of a secondary and a tertiary amine tricyclic antidepressant on cerebral biogenic amines as a function of mouse strain: a comparative neurotoxicological evaluation.): The effect of equal-dose regimens of amitriptyline and nortriptyline on the concentrations of serotonin, dopamine and major acidic metabolites was compared in 5 distinct brain regions as a function of inbred mouse strain. Amitriptyline increased to a greater extent the regional brain serotonin levels in the albino BALB/c mouse than did nortriptyline. Both drugs increased serotonin levels but decreased cerebral 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid levels in some distinct brain regions of the black C57BL/6 mouse strain. The results suggest a strain-dependent differential increase in brain serotonin turnover in specific mouse strain brain regions which may account for the greater incidence of amitriptyline-induced sedation and seizures. The BALB/c mouse was also found to be more sensitive than the C57BL/6 strain to the action of both drugs on dopamine and major acidic metabolites with amitriptyline showing more regional brain potency than nortriptyline. The data suggest an increase in dopamine turnover particularly in brain areas associated with motor function and posture which may account for tricyclic-antidepressant-induced extrapyramidal disorders. The results also indicate that the C57BL/6 mouse strain may be of experimental value for studying the mechanism underlying tricyclic-induced adverse reactions relevant to sedation and movement disorders as a function of genetic predisposition.
Document 11 (Title: Serotonin): Serotonin syndrome Extremely high levels of serotonin can cause a condition known as serotonin syndrome, with toxic and potentially fatal effects. In practice, such toxic levels are essentially impossible to reach through an overdose of a single antidepressant drug, but require a combination of serotonergic agents, such as an SSRI with a MAOI, which may occur in therapeutic doses. The intensity of the symptoms of serotonin syndrome vary over a wide spectrum, and the milder forms are seen even at nontoxic levels. It is estimated that 14% of patients experiencing serotonin syndrome overdose on SSRIs; meanwhile the fatality rate is between 2% to 12%. Antiemetics Some 5-HT3 antagonists, such as ondansetron, granisetron, and tropisetron, are important antiemetic agents. They are particularly important in treating the nausea and vomiting that occur during anticancer chemotherapy using cytotoxic drugs. Another application is in the treatment of postoperative nausea and vomiting. Other
Document 12 (Title: Acute Chest Syndrome -- Epidemiology): Acute chest syndrome is the most prevalent acute pulmonary disorder in individuals with sickle cell disease. [5] Approximately 50% of patients with sickle cell disease will experience more than 1 episode of acute chest syndrome. The peak incidence of acute chest syndrome is observed in pediatric patients between 2 and 4 years old. Among adults, 78% of acute chest syndrome episodes are secondary to vaso-occlusive pain episodes. Acute chest syndrome is the most common cause of death in individuals with sickle cell disease, accounting for nearly 25% of all deaths. The mortality rates associated with acute chest syndrome are 4.3% in adults and 1.1% in children.
Document 13 (Title: Lidocaine -- Administration -- Adult Dosage): Doses used for infiltrative or regional anesthesia depend on the specific block. When lidocaine is used to obtund airway reflexes, the dose is 1 to 2 mg/kg, given 2 to 5 minutes before intubation. For cardiac dysrhythmias, the initial dose is 1 to 1.5 mg/kg given intravenously, optionally followed with an infusion. [5] As an adjuvant intravenous treatment for acute pain, a 2020 consensus statement suggested a loading dose of no more than 1.5mg/kg over 10 minutes, followed by an infusion of no more than 1.5mg/kg/h for no longer than 24 hours (with close monitoring for clinical response and signs of toxicity). [17] The American Society of Anesthesiologists panel noted the absence of definitive evidence regarding the optimal dosing of lidocaine. However, based on clinical experience, the ASA recommends administering an induction dose of 1.5 mg/kg, followed by an intraoperative infusion of 2 mg/kg/h for patients undergoing open and laparoscopic abdominal surgeries. [9] For awake intubation, effective topical application must be ensured. The maximum dose of lidocaine should not exceed 9 mg/kg of lean body weight. To minimize the risk of laryngospasm, clinicians should consider nebulized lidocaine and lower concentrations. [10]
Document 14 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): Peripheral neuropathy is observed in 10–20% of patients given dosages greater than 5 mg/kg/d, but it is infrequently seen with the standard 300-mg adult dose. Peripheral neuropathy is more likely to occur in slow acetylators and patients with predisposing conditions such as malnutrition, alcoholism, diabetes, AIDS, and uremia. Neuropathy is due to a relative pyridoxine deficiency. Isoniazid promotes excretion of pyridoxine, and this toxicity is readily reversed by administration of pyridoxine in a dosage as low as 10 mg/d. Central nervous system toxicity, which is less common, includes memory loss, psychosis, ataxia, and seizures. These effects may also respond to pyridoxine. Miscellaneous other reactions include hematologic abnormalities, provocation of pyridoxine deficiency anemia, tinnitus, and gastrointestinal discomfort.
Document 15 (Title: Cyproheptadine): Cyproheptadine is a very potent antihistamine or inverse agonist of the H1 receptor. At higher concentrations, it also has anticholinergic, antiserotonergic, and antidopaminergic activities. Of the serotonin receptors, it is an especially potent antagonist of the 5-HT2 receptors. This is thought to underlie its effectiveness in the treatment of serotonin syndrome. However, it is possible that blockade of 5-HT1 receptors may also contribute to its effectiveness in serotonin syndrome. Cyproheptadine has been reported to block 85% of 5-HT2 receptors in the human brain at a dose of 4 mg three times per day (12 mg/day total) and to block 95% of 5-HT2 receptors in the human brain at a dose of 6 mg three times per day (18 mg/day total) as measured with positron emission tomography (PET). The dose of cyproheptadine recommended to ensure blockade of the 5-HT2 receptors for serotonin syndrome is 20 to 30 mg. Besides its activity at neurotransmitter targets, cyproheptadine has been reported to
