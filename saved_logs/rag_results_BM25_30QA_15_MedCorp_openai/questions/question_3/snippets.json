It is removable, requiring only a laparoscopic procedure to remove the band, after which the stomach usually returns to its normal pre-banded size so it is not unusual for a person to gain weight after having a band removed. However, it is not entirely reversible as adhesions and tissue scarring are inevitable. Unlike those who have procedures such as RNY, DS, or BPD, it is unusual for gastric band patients to experience any nutritional deficiencies or malabsorption of micro-nutrients. Calcium supplements and Vitamin B12 injections are not routinely required following gastric banding (as is often the case with RNY, for example). Gastric dumping syndrome issues also do not occur since intestines are not removed or re-routed.",

        "content": "The duodenal switch operation preserves the pylorus and the proximal 3 to 7 cm of duodenum in continuity with the stomach while diverting pancreaticobiliary secretions. We compared it with the Roux-en-Y without vagotomy or antrectomy in 12 dogs with innervated gastric pouches. Acid secretion was inhibited between tests using ranitidine in the Roux-en-Y group only, but two of the six dogs still developed stomal ulcers and the remainder showed stomal hyperemia. This may be due to a significant increase in gastric acid output after Roux-en-Y, but gastric emptying and plasma gastrin, cholecystokinin, secretin, gastric inhibitory polypeptide, peptide YY, and neurotensin were similar after both procedures. In 12 patients and a further 6 dogs, the duodenal switch caused no significant change in the intragastric pH environment as assessed by intragastric pH monitoring. The duodenal switch is a suitable procedure for pancreaticobiliary diversion.",
