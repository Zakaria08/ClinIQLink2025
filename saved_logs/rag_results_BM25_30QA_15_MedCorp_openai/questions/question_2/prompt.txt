Document 2 (Title: Unrecognized association of sleep disorders and depression with chronic pelvic pain.): Assessment of cases of chronic pelvic pain presents a challenging problem, and many physicians overlook the association of sleep disorders and depression with such pain. We examined these linkages in our chronic pelvic pain clinic, using a questionnaire that assists in diagnosis and management of these cases. To date, the cases of 72 patients (both physician- and self-referred) with pelvic pain have been evaluated. Of these patients, 51 of 71 (72%) reported sleep disorders, and 37 of 72 (51%) had clinical depression, as determined by the Beck Depression Inventory. After adjustment for a sleep-related item on the Beck scale, these two measures showed a positive correlation of .355 (P &lt; .01). The scores of pain patients differed significantly from those of a control group of asymptomatic patients on the depression and sleep disorder measures. By being aware and using a simple questionnaire, the clinician may readily identify overlooked factors, such as sleep disorders and depression, when assessing cases of chronic pelvic pain.
Document 3 (Title: REM Rebound Effect -- Treatment / Management): Respiratory, cardiac, gastrointestinal, endocrine, psychiatric, and neurological disorders that affect sleep and potentially cause REM rebound should be diagnosed and treated. Medications or substances that might contribute to REM rebound should be adjusted as necessary to minimize their impact on REM sleep.
Document 4 (Title: Adjustment disorder): A stressor is generally an event of a serious, unusual nature that an individual or group of individuals experience. Adjustment disorders can come from a wide range of stressors that can be traumatic or relatively minor, like the loss of a girlfriend/boyfriend, a poor report card, or moving to a new neighborhood. It is thought that the more often the stressor occurs, the more likely it is to produce Adjustment disorder. The objective nature of the stressor is of secondary importance. A stressor gains its pathogenic potential when the patient perceives it as stressful. The identification of a causal stressor is necessary if a diagnosis of adjustment disorder is to be made. There are certain stressors that are more common in different age groups:

Document 6 (Title: Sleep and Neurodegenerative Disorders -- Evaluation -- Insomnia): In patients with Parkinson disease, a detailed evaluation is warranted to identify a potential contributor to insomnia. Patients should be asked about the presence of any motor symptoms at night (cramps, stiffness, or impaired turning in bed), autonomic symptoms such as nocturia, presence of concomitant mood disorder, sleep apnea, or RLS. A history of recent dose adjustments in medications for Parkinson disease should also be obtained. If the patient has difficulty providing a history, sleep logs, diaries, and sleep trackers may be helpful. Self-reported screening tools could be used through validated questionnaires such as the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and sleep problems questionnaire. [49] [50] In patients with Parkinson disease-associated insomnia, Parkinson disease-specific screening questionnaires such as Parkinson Disease Sleep Scale-2 (PDSS-2) or Scales for Outcomes in Parkinson disease-SLEEP can be used. [51] Evaluation tools such as the STOP-Bang score help determine the probability of OSA. [52]
Document 7 (Title: Advanced sleep phase disorder): Epidemiology ASPD is more common among middle and older adults. The estimated prevalence of ASPD is about 1% in middle-age adults, and is believed to affect men and women equally. The disorder has a strong familial tendency, with 40-50% of affected individuals having relatives with ASPD. A genetic basis has been demonstrated in one form of ASPD, familial advanced sleep phase disorder (FASPS), which implicates missense mutations in genes hPER2 and CKIdelta in producing the advanced sleep phase phenotype. The identification of two different genetic mutations suggests that there is heterogeneity of this disorder. Familial advanced sleep phase syndrome
Document 8 (Title: Studies in the genetics of obstructive sleep apnea. Familial aggregation of symptoms associated with sleep-related breathing disturbances.): Previous studies of single families have suggested that familial factors may be important in the pathogenesis of obstructive sleep apnea. In this report, the role of inheritance in obstructive sleep apnea was assessed by quantitating the degree of familial clustering of symptoms associated with sleep-related breathing disorders. In total, 272 subjects from 29 families identified through an index case with obstructive sleep apnea and 21 control families with no relative known to have sleep apnea were studied with questionnaires that ascertained health status and symptoms. The unadjusted odds ratios of habitual or disruptive snoring, breathing pauses, and excessive day-time sleepiness in subjects with a single relative with the same symptom were 1.40 to 1.53 (p less than 0.05). Odds ratios increased progressively for subjects with increasing numbers of symptomatic relatives). Adjustment for body mass index, age, and gender modestly reduced these odds ratios to 1.33 to 1.42. These data suggest a significant familial aggregation of symptoms associated with sleep-disordered breathing that appears independent of familial similarities in weight.
Document 9 (Title: Circadian characteristics influencing interindividual differences in tolerance and adjustment to shiftwork.): The study was carried out to evaluate whether shiftworkers showing different long-term tolerance to shiftwork differ in their circadian adjustments and/or in some behavioural characteristics. Three groups of eight workers, engaged on three shifts in a graphic plant and matched for age and work experience, were selected according to the presence or not of complaints related to shiftwork: (1) no complaints; (2) nervous complaints (anxiety/depression, severe sleep disturbances); (3) digestive disorders (gastroduodenitis, peptic ulcer). They answered questionnaires on family conditions, health status, rigidity of sleeping habits, ability to overcome drowsiness, morningness, manifest anxiety. They also recorded several physiological parameters (oral temperature, grip strength, peak expiratory flow rate, pulse rate, sleep hours) during day and night-shifts. The data obtained indicate that the characteristics of flexibility of sleeping habits, ability to overcome drowsiness, and lower manifest anxiety, are associated with better tolerance to shiftwork. These characteristics do not seem to influence the adjustment of the circadian rhythm of oral temperature passing from day to night-shifts and vice versa. Conversely, morningness appeared to be unrelated to long-term tolerance, but did influence circadian adjustments and sleep behaviour. Among the groups, the subjects with digestive disorders showed a greater phase shift and a reduction of the amplitude on night-work, suggesting a possible relationship also between the short-term circadian adjustment and the long-term tolerance to shiftwork, as pointed out by other authors.
Document 10 (Title: [Drowsiness and traffic accidents. Importance of diagnosis].): "Tiredness", often cited in civil and penal responsibilities secondary to car accidents, hides neurophysiological phenomena which must now be taken into account. The problems of watchfulness in car-driving, is sleepiness, are indeed linked to a genuine disorder in the sleep-wake rythm and attention should be drawn to them in medico-legal cases. Investigations and clinical examinations concerning 110 experts' reports confirm the role played by sleep' disorders in the occurrence of car accidents. Prevention in actually possible. Early detection can take place at various levels and concerns general practitioners, specialists of industrial medicine and specialists for driving tests. In France, the list of diseases associated with, and retraining of a driving license refer only to concentration disorders induced by drug administration, but do not mention sleep pathologies (sleep apnea syndrome, narcolepsy, etc). What is the responsibility of a driver who ignores or says nothing about a sleep pathology from which he is suffering? Is it really necessary to include these pathologies on such a list? It could be more useful to make a large audience; including children, aware of the physiology and pathology of sleep. It appears, from experts' reports, that the management of the problem requires a "driving hygiene".
Document 11 (Title: Delayed sleep phase disorder): The altered phase relationship between the timing of sleep and the circadian rhythm of body core temperature has been reported previously in DSPD patients studied in entrained conditions. That such an alteration has also been observed in temporal isolation (free-running clock) supports the notion that the etiology of DSPD goes beyond simply a reduced capacity to achieve and maintain the appropriate phase relationship between sleep timing and the 24-hour day. Rather, the disorder may also reflect a fundamental inability of the endogenous circadian timing system to maintain normal internal phase relationships among physiological systems, and to properly adjust those internal relationships within the confines of the 24-hour day. In normal subjects, the phase relationship between sleep and temperature changes in temporal isolation relative to that observed under entrained conditions: in isolation, tmin tends to occur toward the beginning of sleep, whereas under entrained conditions, tmin
Document 12 (Title: Psichiatry_DSM-5): REM sleep behavior disorder. REM sleep behavior disorder may be difficult to distin- guish from NREM sleep arousal disorders. REM sleep behavior disorder is characterized by episodes of prominent, complex movements, often involving personal injury arising from sleep. In contrast to NREM sleep arousal disorders, REM sleep behavior disorder oc- curs during REM sleep. Individuals with REM sleep behavior disorder awaken easily and report more detailed and vivid dream content than do individuals with NREM sleep arousal disorders. They often report that they “act out dreams.” Parasomnia overlap syndrome. Parasomnia overlap syndrome consists of clinical and polysomnographic features of both sleepwalking and REM sleep behavior disorder.
Document 13 (Title: Sleep and Neurodegenerative Disorders -- Epidemiology): The coexistence of SDB and Parkinson disease has been reported in the literature in variable frequency (prevalence between 27% and 73%). [31] [32] Even though several studies have indicated that many patients with Parkinson disease experience SDB, the reported prevalence varies due to various factors, such as different definitions of respiratory events, severity thresholds of the disease, or diagnostic methods employed. [33] [34] This variability in reported prevalence is explained by heterogeneity in sample size, disease severity, and diagnostic definition and testing modality. For example, using standard diagnostic polysomnography (PSG) in a retrospective series of 49 patients with Parkinson disease, at least 21 patients (43%) had OSA diagnosed (apnea/hypopnea index [AHI] ≥5 events/hour). [35]
Document 14 (Title: Bruxism Management -- Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes): The diagnosis primarily relies on clinical evaluation, although polysomnography may be necessary for patients suspected of having sleep disorders. Treatment focuses on preventing tooth damage and easing associated symptoms. Clinicians employ counseling and behavioral interventions to encourage patients to abstain from substances such as alcohol, caffeine, and tobacco, especially before bedtime. Clinicians may also recommend lifestyle modifications or medication adjustments as needed. Additional treatment options encompass oral devices, pharmacological therapies, and investigational treatments such as botulinum toxin injections. Addressing comorbid obstructive sleep apnea is paramount for affected patients.
Document 15 (Title: Sleep Disorder -- Epidemiology -- Sleep-Related Movement Disorders): There are also racial and ethnic differences in the prevalence of sleep disorders. [34] In the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), Hispanics and Chinese individuals had higher odds of SDB and short sleep than Whites. Likewise, Black have higher odds (1.8) for sleep apnea syndrome (AHI > five events per hour associated with excessive daytime sleepiness) compared to white after adjusting for age, gender and BMI.
