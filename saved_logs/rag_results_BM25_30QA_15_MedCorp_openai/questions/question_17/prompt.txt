Document 1 (Title: Prostate Cancer -- Medical Oncology -- Aggressive Prostate Cancer): Aggressive disease in prostate cancer is typically defined as either locally advanced, a higher Gleason score (Gleason 4+4=8 or higher), or a rapid PSA doubling time of 10 months or less. Treatment for aggressive prostate cancers may involve radical prostatectomy, radiation therapy, HIFU, cryosurgery, hormonal therapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, radiopharmaceuticals, or some combination of these. Early use of combinatorial therapies is helpful in many patients presenting with aggressive or advanced, localized disease. [26] [296] [321]
Document 2 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): boney structures. Modern CT PET scans have a limited role at this point.Treatment for localized prostate cancer is guided by can-cer aggressiveness and patient’s preferences. Active sur-veillance is recommended for patients with low-risk disease grade 1–2, early-stage disease (cT1c), and small volume disease as determined by biopsy. Large prospective cohorts and randomized clinical trials have established the safety of this approach.134,135 The risk of progression to metastatic disease with close follow-up and repeat prostate biopsies is less than 2% in over 12 years. Radical prostatectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection (robotic, laparoscopic, or open), image modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), and brachytherapy are the standard of care for curative treatments. All provide equal cancer specific survival for low and intermediate risk cancers. For higher risk prostate cancer patients, both surgery and IMRT with androgen 8Figure 40-11.

Document 3 (Title: Decision making during serious illness: what role do patients really want to play?): Two surveys were conducted to determine what roles people actually want to assume in selecting cancer treatments. 436 newly diagnosed cancer patients and 482 members of the general public participated. Preferences were elicited using two card sort procedures, each of which described five potential roles in decision making. Findings suggested that the impact of being diagnosed with a life-threatening illness may influence preferences to participate. The majority (59%) of patients wanted physicians to make treatment decisions on their behalf, but 64% of the public thought they would want to select their own treatment if they developed cancer. Most patients (51%) and members of the public (46%) wanted their physician and family to share responsibility for decision making if they were too ill to participate. Sociodemographic variables accounted for only 15% of variance in preferences. These variables are not particularly useful in making predictions about which groups want more or less active roles in medical decision making.
Document 4 (Title: Biochemical recurrence): Biochemical recurrence is a rise in the blood level of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in prostate cancer patients after treatment with surgery or radiation. Biochemical recurrence may occur in patients who do not have symptoms. It may mean that the cancer has come back. Also called PSA failure and biochemical relapse. It is used to detect metastatic progression of the prostate cancer.

Document 5 (Title: Treatment of localized prostatic cancer.): Discovery of a localized prostatic cancer frequently creates a therapeutic dilemma. A significant number of patients do well for an extended period of time without treatment, while others suffer rapid tumor progression and death from prostatic cancer. Without treatment nearly one third of patients with stage B prostatic cancer can be expected to develop distant metastatic disease or death from prostatic cancer within 10 years. In patients who otherwise have a reasonable life expectancy of 10 years or more, aggressive therapy is justified. Long-term disease-free survival has been reported after both radical prostatectomy and external irradiation. The fact that nearly 50% of patients treated with external irradiation for stage B prostatic cancer have positive postirradiation biopsies is of concern, but the impact of this finding on overall survival is yet to be determined. The only randomized prospective study comparing radical prostatectomy with external irradiation showed a statistically significant decrease in the time to Nevertheless, as evidenced by the National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Panel, further randomized prospective trials are needed to determine the relative value of radical prostatectomy versus external irradiation for localized prostatic cancer. For the forseeable future, definitive scientific data on which to base treatment recommendations will not be available. Therefore, patients should be well informed of the various treatment options available, and the wishes of the patient are paramount. The clinician's roles are to interpret the data, present it in a meaningful manner to patients, be guided in discussions by patient preferences, and make recommendations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Document 6 (Title: Pathology_Robbins): The relatively low rate of mortality in men with prostate cancer is related in part to increased detection of the disease through screening (discussed later), but how effective screening is at saving lives is controversial. This seeming paradox is related to the wide variation in the natural history of prostate cancer, from aggressive and rapidly fatal to indolent disease of no clinical significance. Indeed, prostate carcinoma commonly is found incidentally at autopsy in men dying of other causes, and many more men die with prostate cancer than of prostate cancer. It is not currently possible to identify the tumors that will be “bad actors” with certainty; thus, while some men are no doubt saved by early detection and treatment of their prostate cancers, it is equally certain that others are being “cured” of clinically inconsequential tumors.
Document 7 (Title: 5α-Reductase inhibitor): Mild-to-moderate benign prostatic hyperplasia and lower urinary tract symptoms Pattern hair loss in both men and women 5-ARIs can be used in the treatment of hirsutism in women. The usefulness of 5-ARIs for the potential treatment of acne is uncertain. 5-ARIs are sometimes used as antiandrogens in feminizing hormone therapy for transgender women to help reduce body hair growth and scalp hair loss. They have also been explored in the treatment and prevention of prostate cancer. While the 5-ARI finasteride reduces the cancer risk by about a third, it also increases the fraction of aggressive forms of prostate cancer. Overall, there does not seem to be a survival benefit for prostate cancer patients under finasteride.
Document 8 (Title: Prostate Cancer -- Prognosis -- Do We Absolutely, Positively Need to Have a Positive Prostate Tissue Biopsy to Treat Prostate Cancer?): With the use of MRI imaging, genomic analysis, validated prostatic nomograms, and all of the other pre-biopsy predictive tests, it is feasible to consider initiating some degree of prostate cancer treatment in selected cases even without absolute histological confirmation of malignancy if the likelihood of cancer is sufficiently high. Such cases are likely to be infrequent, and patients must be thoroughly informed about the standard of care and the potential risks and benefits of treatment without absolute confirmation of an aggressive prostatic malignancy.

Document 10 (Title: Prostate Cancer -- Evaluation -- Genomic (Somatic) Tumor Biomarkers (Post-Biopsy)): Prolaris test: This test was the first commercially available genomic tumor marker to evaluate prostate cancer aggressiveness. [217] The Prolaris test analyzes 46 genes and specifically measures the RNA expression of 31 genes involved in cell cycle progression. The test is designed to indicate the risk of biochemical recurrence and prostate cancer-specific mortality over the next 10 years when combined with the PSA level, clinical stage, percentage of positive biopsy cores, biopsy grade group, and AUA risk group. [212] In a large prospective registry, the Prolaris test changed the initial treatment selection in 47.8% of 1600 participants, with 75% opting for a less aggressive therapy and 25% choosing a more definitive treatment option. [218] The test is most useful in facilitating decision-making for individuals with localized disease and low- or intermediate-risk cancers (both favorable and unfavorable) who are considering active surveillance versus definitive treatment. Prolaris can identify cancer-specific mortality for men on active surveillance and with biochemical recurrence for those who have had radiation therapy or undergone TURP surgery. [144] [212] Similar to the Decipher test, the Prolaris test is also useful in patients after radical prostatectomy surgery and in high-risk cases for prognostic purposes. [212]
Document 11 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): around the 5and 8-year survival distributions for the two groups overlapped. A large randomized study comparing early to late hormone treatment (orchiectomy or GnRH analogue) in patients with locally advanced or asymptomatic metastatic disease showed that patients treated early were less likely to progress from M0 to M1 disease, to develop pain, and to die of prostate cancer. This trial was criticized because therapy was delayed “too long” in the late-treatment group. Noteworthy is that the American Society of Clinical Oncology Guidelines recommend deferring treatment until the disease has recurred and the prognosis has been reassessed. These guidelines do not support immediate therapy.
Document 12 (Title: Localized Prostate Cancer -- Introduction): Men with low-grade tumors rarely die from prostate cancer. They are much more likely to die from other causes first. On the other hand, men with high-grade disease are more likely to die from prostate cancer within ten years without radical treatment. The prognosis of men with intermediate-risk cancer is the most difficult to predict. The perceived increased risk of mortality compared to low-risk disease can often push clinicians towards radical treatment in these cases. Still, such a strategy has been challenged by the findings of studies such as the ProtecT study of treatments for localized prostate cancer. Prognostic markers and scoring will likely be of great interest to this group of patients. [8]
Document 13 (Title: Prostate cancer staging): Prostate cancer staging is the process by which physicians categorize the risk of cancer having spread beyond the prostate, or equivalently, the probability of being cured with local therapies such as surgery or radiation. Once patients are placed in prognostic categories, this information can contribute to the selection of an optimal approach to treatment. Prostate cancer stage can be assessed by either clinical or pathological staging methods. Clinical staging usually occurs before the first treatment and tumour presence is determined through imaging and rectal examination, while pathological staging is done after treatment once a biopsy is performed or the prostate is removed by looking at the cell types within the sample.
Document 14 (Title: Gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist): The reduction in testosterone levels that occurs during GnRH antagonist therapy subsequently reduces the size of the prostate cancer. This in turn results in a reduction in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels in the patient’s blood and so measuring PSA levels is a way to monitor how patients with prostate cancer are responding to treatment. GnRH antagonists have an immediate onset of action leading to a fast and profound suppression of testosterone and are therefore especially valuable in the treatment of patients with prostate cancer, where fast control of disease is needed. The GnRH antagonist abarelix was withdrawn from the United States market in 2005 and is now only marketed in Germany for use in patients with symptomatic prostate cancer. Degarelix is a GnRH antagonist that is approved for use in patients with advanced hormone-sensitive prostate cancer throughout Europe and also in the United States. Fertility treatment
Document 15 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): The prostate cancer continuum—from the appearance of a preneoplastic and invasive lesion localized to the prostate, to a metastatic lesion that results in symptoms and, ultimately, mortality—can span decades. To facilitate disease management, competing risks are considered in the context of a series of clinical states (Fig. 115-1). The states are defined operationally on the basis of whether or not a cancer diagnosis has been established and, for those with a diagnosis, whether or not metastases are detectable on imaging studies and the measured level of testosterone in the blood. With this approach, an individual resides in only one state and remains in that state until he has progressed. At each assessment, the decision to offer treatment and the specific form of treatment are based on the risk posed by the cancer relative to competing causes of mortality that may be present in that individual. It follows that the more advanced the disease, the greater is the need for treatment.
