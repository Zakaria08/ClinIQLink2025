Document 1 (Title: [Acute poisoning with ethylene glycol esters].): The study was performed of 13 acute oral poisonings with ethylene glycol ethers characterized as moderate or severe and resulting in poor outcome in 3 cases. Ethyl ether was responsible for 3 poisonings, methyl ether for 10 ones. It was found, that the intoxication had four stages or periods (initial, latent, clinical, recovery) and presented with CNS impairment, gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal disorders, decompensated metabolic acidosis, etc. The paper describes two clinical cases and experimental toxicity of cellosolves as well as the effect of the inhibitor of isovaleric acid amide alcohol dehydrogenase on animal lethality. The results obtained support the suggestion of ADH-participated metabolic activation of cellosolves in the body. The prospects of further studies into intoxication pathogenesis and new opportunities for relevant poisoning management are outlined.
Document 2 (Title: Jet fuel): from acute, subchronic, or chronic exposure of humans or animals to kerosene-based hydrocarbon fuels, or the constituent chemicals of these fuels, or to fuel combustion products. The effects studied include: cancer, skin conditions, respiratory disorders, immune and hematological disorders, neurological effects, visual and hearing disorders, renal and hepatic diseases, cardiovascular conditions, gastrointestinal disorders, genotoxic and metabolic effects.
Document 3 (Title: Ethylene Glycol Toxicity -- Epidemiology): Individuals at risk include toddlers and young children exploring their environment, patients with alcohol use disorder, and individuals wanting to end their lives. [1] According to the Annual Report of the American Association of Poison Control Centers' National Poison Data System, the number of case mentions of ethylene glycol in 2016 was 6,374. Most of these cases were intentional in adults older than 20. [4] Children younger than 12 comprised 686 of the 6374 cases, with 13 unknown child-age cases. [4]
Document 4 (Title: Physiology, Acid Base Balance -- Pathophysiology -- Increased Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis): The mnemonic MUDPILES has classically been used to teach students the causes of high anion gap metabolic acidosis. MUDPILES stands for methanol, uremia, diabetic ketoacidosis, paraldehyde, infection, lactic acidosis, ethylene glycol, and salicylates. A new mnemonic, GOLDMARK, has been suggested to be an improvement. GOLDMARK is an anagram for glycols (ethylene and propylene), oxoproline, lactate, methanol, aspirin, renal failure, and ketones. If a patient has an anion gap over 12, these mnemonics are helpful to remember the possible causes of the disorder. [7] [8]
Document 5 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): Three stages of ethylene glycol overdose occur. Within the first few hours after ingestion, there is transient excitation followed by CNS depression. After a delay of 4–12 hours, severe metabolic acidosis develops from accumulation of acid metabolites and lactate. Finally, deposition of oxalate crystals in renal tubules occurs, followed by delayed renal insufficiency. The key to the diagnosis of ethylene glycol poisoning is recognition of anion gap acidosis, osmolar gap, and oxalate crystals in the urine in a patient without visual symptoms.
Document 6 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): APPROACH TO THE PATIENT: There are four principal causes of a high-AG acidosis: (1) lactic acidosis, (2) ketoacidosis, (3) ingested toxins, and (4) acute and chronic renal failure (Table 66-4). Initial screening to differentiate the high-AG acidoses should include (1) a probe of the history for evidence of drug and toxin ingestion and measurement of arterial blood gas to detect coexistent respiratory alkalosis (salicylates); (2) determination of whether diabetes mellitus is present (diabetic ketoacidosis); (3) a search for evidence of alcoholism or increased levels of β-hydroxybutyrate (alcoholic ketoacidosis); (4) observation for clinical signs of uremia and determination of the blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (uremic acidosis); (5) inspection of the urine for oxalate crystals (ethylene glycol); and (6) recognition of the numerous clinical settings in which lactate levels may be increased (hypotension, shock, cardiac failure, leukemia, cancer, and drug or toxin ingestion).
Document 7 (Title: Conversion disorder): The diagnostic criteria for functional neurological symptom disorder, as set out in DSM-5, are: Specify type of symptom or deficit as: With weakness or paralysis With abnormal movement (e.g. tremor, dystonic movement, myoclonus, gait disorder) With swallowing symptoms With speech symptoms (e.g. dysphonia, slurred speech) With attacks or seizures With amnesia or memory loss With special sensory loss symptoms (e.g. visual blindness, olfactory loss, or hearing disturbance) With mixed symptoms. Specify if: Acute episode: symptoms present for less than six months Persistent: symptoms present for six months or more. Specify if: Psychological stressor (conversion disorder) No psychological stressor (functional neurological symptom disorder) Exclusion of neurological disease

Document 9 (Title: Ethylene glycol toxicity.): Ingestion of ethylene glycol is a rare occurrence, but it is an attractive agent for intoxication and suicide. Treatment is aimed at rapid excretion of the EG, prevention of the formation of metabolites, and the prevention and treatment of renal failure. Prior to discharge, Mr K revealed that he had drunk the antifreeze because he was despondent about his work situation. He had a short, but intensive trajectory that followed the three-system-involvement classic to EG poisoning, with the renal system most severely affected. Mr K was discharged from the hospital one week after admission and referred to appropriate community resources for counseling. The critical care nurse plays a key role in alleviating the hazards of this complex disorder through complete and ongoing assessment of all systems.
Document 10 (Title: Psichiatry_DSM-5): Intermittent explosive disorder. Intermittent explosive disorder also involves high rates of anger. However, individuals with this disorder show serious aggression toward others that is not part of the definition of oppositional defiant disorder. Intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder). In individuals with intel- lectual disability, a diagnosis of oppositional defiant disorder is given only if the opposi- tional behavior is markedly greater than is commonly observed among individuals of comparable mental age and with comparable severity of intellectual disability. Language disorder. Oppositional defiant disorder must also be distinguished from a failure to follow directions that is the result of impaired language comprehension (e.g., hearing loss). Social anxiety disorder (social phobia). Oppositional defiant disorder must also be dis- tinguished from defiance due to fear of negative evaluation associated with social anxiety disorder.
Document 11 (Title: Antidotes -- Issues of Concern -- Background and Presentation): Ethylene glycol and methanol : Poisoning with ethylene glycol or methanol may occur through attempted self-harm, unintentional ingestion, or a misguided attempt at inebriation. In 2007, United States poison centers received a combined 8014 calls related to possible ethylene glycol or methanol exposure. [11] Ethylene glycol, an essential component of antifreeze, has a bright color and sweet taste, making it particularly appealing to children. Classic signs and symptoms of ethylene glycol poisoning include altered mental state, metabolic acidosis, acute renal failure, and oxalate crystals in the urine. Hypocalcemia, multiorgan dysfunction, and even death occur in severe cases. [11] Methanol is present in embalming fluids, paint removers, windshield-washer fluid, canned-heating products, and moonshine liquor. Methanol poisoning causes profound metabolic acidosis and visual changes that may lead to blindness. Severe cases can result in multiorgan failure and death. Untreated methanol poisoning carries a mortality rate as high as 28% with permanent visual defects or blindness in up to 30% of survivors. [11]
Document 12 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): For control of ethanol or other sedative-hypnotic withdrawal states widely used for the management of acute anxiety states and for rapid control of panic attacks. They are also used, though less commonly, in the long-term management of GAD and panic disorders. Anxiety symptoms may be relieved by many benzodiazepines, but it is not always easy to demonstrate the superiority of one drug over another. Alprazolam has been used in the treatment of panic disorders and agoraphobia and appears to be more selective in these conditions than other benzodiazepines. The choice of benzodiazepines for anxiety is based on several sound pharmacologic principles: (1) a rapid onset of action; (2) a relatively high therapeutic index (see drug B in Figure 22–1), plus availability of flumazenil for treatment of overdose; (3) a low risk of drug interactions based on liver enzyme induction; and (4) minimal effects on cardiovascular or autonomic functions.
Document 13 (Title: Magnesium deficiency and cardiac disorders.): Magnesium deficiency can occur in congestive heart failure, after diuresis with furoxemide, ethacrynic acid and mercurials, and with digitalis intoxication, diabetic acidosis, acute and chronic alcoholism, delerium tremens, cirrhosis, malabsorption syndromes, protracted postoperative cases, open heart surgery, the diuretic phase of acute tubular necrosis, and with hypoparathyroidism, primary aldosteronism, juxta-glomerular hyperplasia and pancreatitis. Two cases of serious ventricular arrhythmias associated with magnesium depletion are described. Clinical manifestations are vague but center around neurologic symptoms such as weakness, tremors, stupor, coma, nausea, vomiting and anorexia. Serious cardiac arrhythmias also occur with magnesium depletion. Magnesium appears to be very useful in hypomagnesemic or digitalis-toxic tachyarrhythmias. Magnesium may also be valuable in normomagnesemic tachyarrhythmias. Ten to fifteen milliliters of a 20 percent magnesium sulfate solution, given intravenously over 1 minute, followed by a slow 4 to 6 hour infusion of 500 ml of 2 per cent magnesium sulfate in 5 per cent dextrose in water is recommended. Recurrence of arrhythmias is common and a second infusion of magnesium sulfate may be necessary. Hypermagnesemia occurs frequently in renal insufficiency, and magnesium therapy may then be contraindicated. Serum levels above 5.5 meq/liter should be avoided. Loss of deep tendon reflexes and a decrease in respiratory rate can be used as guides to magnesium therapy. A plea is made for frequent analysis of serum magnesium so that more knowledge can be gained regarding this important biologic element in cardiovascular disorders.
Document 14 (Title: Biochemistry_Lippinco): Enzymes have diagnostic and therapeutic value in medicine. Choose the ONE best answer. .1. In cases of ethylene glycol poisoning and its characteristic metabolic acidosis, treatment involves correction of the acidosis, removal of any remaining ethylene glycol, and administration of an inhibitor of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), the enzyme that oxidizes ethylene glycol to the organic acids that cause the acidosis. Ethanol (grain alcohol) frequently is the inhibitor given to treat ethylene glycol poisoning. Results of experiments using ADH with and without ethanol are shown to the right. Based on these data, what type of inhibition is caused by the ethanol? A. Competitive B. Feedback C. Irreversible D. Noncompetitive
Document 15 (Title: La Belle Indifference -- Introduction): The term “la belle indifference” is a French term that translates to “beautiful ignorance.” [1] La belle indifference is defined as a paradoxical absence of psychological distress despite a serious medical illness or symptoms of a health condition. [2] This condition is most commonly associated with conversion disorder. According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders V (DSM 5), conversion disorder is also referred to as functional neurologic symptom disorder (FNSD). FNSD, or conversion disorder, is characterized by at least 1 neurological deficit with no medical or neurological etiology and is incompatible with any known medical or neurological disorders. Psychological distress or conflict may be manifested as a physical symptom in patients with conversion disorder. La belle indifference is not formally included in DSM 5 as a diagnosis. However, it is used in conjunction with conversion disorder. [3]
