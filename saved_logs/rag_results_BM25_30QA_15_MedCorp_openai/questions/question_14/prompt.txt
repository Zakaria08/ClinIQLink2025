Document 1 (Title: Status evaluation: enteroscopy.): Enteroscopy is a method to examine the small bowel mucosa beyond the reach of standard upper endoscopes. In practice it has primarily been used to search for a bleeding lesion in patients where one is not detected by conventional means. Such patients constitute only a small percentage of those who bleed (15,20). Experience is greatest with push enteroscopy. Examination of the distal duodenum and proximal jejunum using a standard or pediatric colonoscope is practical, appears to be safe and provides a satisfactory diagnostic and therapeutic yield in experienced hands. Longer designated push enteroscopes are under investigation. Sonde type enteroscopes can be passed to the ileum in most cases. A cause for bleeding can be detected in approximately one-quarter to one-third of individuals with minimal morbidity. Certain technical problems limit their efficacy and their role in the evaluation of patients with bleeding has not yet been clearly defined.
Document 2 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Push enteroscopy is performed with a long endoscope similar in design to an upper endoscope. The enteroscope is pushed down the small bowel, sometimes with the help of a stiffening overtube that extends from the mouth to the small intestine. The proximal to mid-jejunum is usually reached, and the instrument channel of the endoscope allows for biopsy or endoscopic therapy. Deeper insertion into the small bowel can be accomplished by single-or double-balloon enteroscopy or spiral enteroscopy (Fig. 345-9). These instruments enable pleating of the small intestine onto an over-tube (see Video 346e-1). With balloon-assisted enteroscopy, the entire intestinal tract can be visualized in some patients when both the oral and anal routes of insertion are used. Biopsies and endoscopic therapy can be performed throughout the visualized small bowel (Fig. 345-10).
Document 3 (Title: Small Bowel Bleeding -- Evaluation -- Push Enteroscopy): Push enteroscopy or double-balloon enteroscopy is a new advancement to standard endoscopes. They have been used when the lesion is farther down in the small bowel and not seen with the standard endoscopes. It uses two balloons, which can help the scope be pushed farther into the small bowel. [22] It is possible to see the lesions, as far as the ileum, depending upon the performer's expertise. The advantage is the ability to treat, take biopsies and mark the area with the tattoo. Studies have shown that the enteroscope has identified the bleeding source in about 74% of patients and treated about 60% to 70%. [23]
Document 4 (Title: Double-balloon enteroscopy): The double-balloon enteroscope can also be passed in retrograde fashion, through the colon and into the ileum to visualize the end of the small bowel. Indications Double-balloon enteroscopy has found a niche application in the following settings: Bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract of obscure cause Iron deficiency anemia with normal colonoscopy and gastroscopy Visualization and therapeutic intervention on abnormalities seen on traditional small bowel imaging Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in post-surgical patients with long afferent limbs Advantages and disadvantages
Document 5 (Title: A Review of Hereditary Colorectal Cancers -- Etiology -- High-Penetrance Genetic Syndromes): Hamartomatous polyps in the small bowel are usually diagnosed with small-bowel capsule endoscopy or double-balloon enteroscopy. Double-balloon enteroscopy also enables therapeutic interventions, such as polypectomy. These lesions may lead to several complications, such as bleeding, obstruction, and intussusception. The risk of colorectal, gastric, small bowel, and pancreatic cancers is elevated, [37] [38] with the incidence of cancer rising significantly after age 50. [39] Screening for pancreatic cancer using endoscopic ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography is recommended in adults. [40] The diagnosis is established based on the following criteria: [41]
Document 6 (Title: Angiodysplasia -- Evaluation): Small bowel angiodysplasia as a source of obscure GI bleeding may require further evaluation with wireless video capsule endoscopy or deep bowel enteroscopy (single or double-balloon enteroscopy) if the initial workup is negative.
Document 7 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): Other etiologies of obscure GI bleeding include Crohn’s dis-ease, infectious enteritides, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-induced ulcers and erosions, vasculitis, ischemia, var-ices, diverticuli, and intussusception.The diagnostic evaluation of patients with obscure GI bleeding should be tailored to the severity to bleeding and to the availability of technology and expertise. Enteroscopy is playing an increasingly important role. Several endoscopic techniques for visualizing the small intestine are available: push enteros-copy, sonde enteroscopy, intraoperative enteroscopy, double balloon endoscopy, and wireless capsule enteroscopy.Push enteroscopy entails advancing a long endoscope (such as a pediatric or adult colonoscope or a specialized instru-ment) beyond the ligament of Treitz into the proximal jejunum. This procedure can allow for visualization of approximately 60 cm of the proximal jejunum. Diagnostic yield in patients with obscure GI bleeding ranges from 3% to
Document 8 (Title: Efficacy of intraoperative enteroscopy in diagnosis and prevention of recurrent, occult gastrointestinal bleeding.): The role and effectiveness of intraoperative enteroscopy in the evaluation of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding of obscure origin is not clearly defined. Our aim was to determine if intraoperative enteroscopy is effective in identifying a source, which would lead to therapy and prevent recurrent gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Forty-four patients (median age: 64 years) underwent intraoperative enteroscopy. Median number of preoperative blood transfusions, duration of bleeding (months), and prior hospitalizations for GI hemorrhage were 19, 15, and 2, respectively. Many patients had risk factors associated with bleeding. All had undergone an extensive preoperative evaluation. Intraoperative enteroscopy was completely negative in 13 (30%). A site-specific source was seen in the small bowel in 31 patients (70%); 27 patients had lesions amenable to segmental resection with or without other means of definitive management. Only 6 of 31 patients (19%) had lesions that were actively bleeding. Twenty-three (52%) patients have had recurrent bleeding requiring transfusion (median follow-up: 21 months). Although intraoperative enteroscopy identified specific mucosal abnormalities in 70% of patients, the therapeutic efficacy in preventing recurrent hemorrhage was only 41%. Intraoperative enteroscopy is an effective tool in selected patients with occult GI bleeding and correctly identifies a treatable source and prevents recurrent bleeding in 41% of patients.
Document 9 (Title: Enteroscopy): Enteroscopy is the procedure of using an endoscope for the direct visualization of the small bowel. Etymologically, the word could potentially refer to any bowel endoscopy (entero- + -scopy), but idiomatically it is conventionally restricted to small bowel endoscopy, in distinction from colonoscopy, which is large bowel endoscopy. Various types of enteroscopy exist, as follows: Video chip enteroscopy Double-balloon enteroscopy Single-balloon enteroscopy Spiral enteroscopy Wireless endoscopy Capsule endoscopy
Document 10 (Title: Double-balloon enteroscopy): Advantages and disadvantages Double-balloon enteroscopy offers a number of advantages to other small bowel image techniques, including barium imaging, wireless capsule endoscopy and push enteroscopy: It allows for visualization of the entire small bowel to the terminal ileum. It allows for the application of therapeutics. It allows for the sampling or biopsying of small bowel mucosa, for the resection of polyps of the small bowel, and in the placement of stents or dilatation of strictures of the small bowel. It allows for access to the papilla in patients with long afferent limbs after Billroth II antrectomy. The key disadvantage of double-balloon enteroscopy is the time required to visualize the small bowel; this can exceed three hours, and may require that patients be admitted to hospital for the procedure. There have also been case reports of acute pancreatitis and intestinal necrosis associated with the technique. References Gastroenterology Endoscopy
Document 11 (Title: Double-balloon enteroscopy): Double-balloon enteroscopy, also known as push-and-pull enteroscopy is an endoscopic technique for visualization of the small bowel. It was developed by Hironori Yamamoto in 2001. It is novel in the field of diagnostic gastroenterology as it is the first endoscopic technique that allows for the entire gastrointestinal tract to be visualized in real time.
Document 12 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): If capsule endoscopy is positive, management is dictated by the finding. If capsule endoscopy is negative, current recommendations suggest patients may either be observed or, if their clinical course mandates (e.g., recurrent bleeding, need for transfusions or hospitalization), undergo further testing. “Deep” enteroscopy (e.g., double-balloon, single-balloon, and spiral enteroscopy) is commonly the next test undertaken in patients with clinically important obscure GIB because it allows the endoscopist to examine, obtain specimens from, and provide therapy to much or all of the small intestine. CT and magnetic resonance enterography also are used to examine the small intestine. Other imaging techniques sometimes used in evaluation of obscure GIB include 99mTc-labeled red blood cell scintigraphy, multidetector CT “angiography,” angiography, and 99mTc-pertechnetate scintigraphy for Meckel’s diverticulum (especially in young patients). If all tests are unrevealing, intraoperative
Document 13 (Title: [Endoscopy of the small intestine in 1991: is it the end of the tunnel?].): Small bowel enteroscopy in 1991 is now feasible in two clinical situations: in the case of malabsorption or diffuse intestinal disease, it is easier to visualise the small bowel with the "push enteroscopy methods". The most proximal and distal ends of the small intestine can be viewed through standard instruments or better with videocoloscope beyond the ligament of Treitz. The ileocecal valve can be intubated after total colonoscopy for the evaluation of Crohn's disease, tuberculosis and small bowel lymphoma. In the case of occult gastrointestinal hemorrhage small bowel enteroscopy now permits visualization of large amounts of small intestinal. When the gastrointestinal bleeding is severe, we recommend intraoperative enteroscopy. When the bleeding is not severe and chronic, it is possible to perform a non surgical total small bowel enteroscopy with an enteroscope or videoenteroscopoe. Prototypes are under development. The procedure is safe an can be performed on an outpatient basis. The limitations of the procedure are the impossibility of intervention and inability to inspect the total mucosal surface. It is not a "first line" or "second line" investigation in these situations. It should be considered after previous investigations have been negative. Push enteroscopy should be performed by general endoscopists, non surgical and total enteroscopy should be reserved, for instance for skills and motivated team endoscopists.
Document 14 (Title: Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass Chronic Complications -- Issues of Concern -- Choledocholithiasis): Patients may present with stones in the common bile duct and resultant cholangitis or pancreatitis. A useful diagnostic tool would be MRCP in this setting. The usual treatment, conventional ERCP, is not feasible since the duodenum is excluded and connected to the remnant stomach. Options in this situation are double-balloon enteroscopy, laparoscopic-assisted ERCP with a remnant stomach gastrostomy, percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography, and open common bile duct exploration. [8]
Document 15 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): and inflammatory bowel disease. Sigmoidoscopy examines the colon up to the splenic flexure and is currently used to exclude distal colonic inflammation or obstruction in young patients not at significant risk for colon cancer. For elusive GI bleeding secondary to arteriovenous malformations or superficial ulcers, small-intestinal examination is performed with push enteroscopy, capsule endoscopy, or double-balloon enteroscopy. Capsule endoscopy also can visualize small-intestinal Crohn’s disease in individuals with negative barium radiography. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreaticography (ERCP) provides diagnoses of pancreatic and biliary disease. Endoscopic ultrasound is useful for evaluating extent of disease in GI malignancy as well as exclusion of choledocholithiasis, evaluation of pancreatitis, drainage of pancreatic pseudocysts, and assessment of anal continuity.
