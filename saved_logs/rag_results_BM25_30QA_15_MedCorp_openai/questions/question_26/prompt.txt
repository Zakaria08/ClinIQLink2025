Document 1 (Title: Vitamin B12 metabolism in the fruit bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus). The induction of vitamin B12 deficiency and its effect on folate levels.): 1. Vitamin B12 metabolism was studied in bats of the species Rousettus aegyptiacus, which live on an all-fruit diet in the wild. 2. There was a wide range in values for the serum vitamin B12 concentration of newly captured bats, but bats captured in the early spring had significantly higher mean serum vitamin B12 levels than bats captured in the early autumn. 3. There was an exponential decrease in serum vitamin B12 concentration with time in captivity for bats fed on a vitamin B12-deficient, all-fruit diet; the biological half-life was 80 d in serum, 109 d in liver and 164 d in kidney. 4. The main storage organ for vitamin B12 in the bats was the liver, mean content 1067 ng vitamin B12. After 50 d, injected [57Co]cyanocobalamin had equilibrated with body vitamin B12 stores, and 17% of the retained radioactivity was present in the liver. From these results it was calculated that the total body vitamin B12 content of the bat was c. 6500 ng. 5. The biological half-life of injected [57Co]cyanocobalamin was 70--88 d and the calculated daily requirement was 50--60 ng (0-2 mug/kg body-weight per d). 6. As serum vitamin B12 levels decreased, serum folate levels increased. The erythrocyte folate concentration increased significantly after 130 d on the all-fruit diet and then decreased to the initial values after 190 d. 7. Vitamin B12 metabolism in the fruit bat is similar in many respects to that of man, but on a 'weight-for-weight' basis the bat has a 5- to 15-fold greater requirement for this vitamin. 8. Vitamin B12 deficiency may be induced fairly rapidly in fruit bats fed on an all-fruit diet.
Document 2 (Title: Biochemistry_Lippinco): Prognosis: The prognosis for recovery is excellent. Case-Related Questions: Choose the ONE best answer. Q1. Which of the following statements about vitamin C is correct? Vitamin C is: A. a competitor of iron absorption in the intestine. B. a fat-soluble vitamin with a 3-month supply typically stored in adipose tissue. C. a coenzyme in several enzymic reactions such as the hydroxylation of proline. D. required for the cross-linking of collagen. Q2. In contrast to the microcytic anemia characteristic of iron deficiency (common in older adults), a macrocytic anemia is seen with deficiencies of vitamin B12 and/or folic acid. These vitamin deficiencies are also common in older adults. Which of the following statements concerning these vitamins is correct? A. An inability to absorb B12 results in pernicious anemia. B. Both vitamins cause changes in gene expression. C. Folic acid plays a key role in energy metabolism in most cells.
Document 3 (Title: Nutrient): Vitamins Vitamins are organic molecules essential for an organism that are not classified as amino acids or fatty acids. They commonly function as enzymatic cofactors, metabolic regulators or antioxidants. Humans require thirteen vitamins in their diet, most of which are actually groups of related molecules (e.g. vitamin E includes tocopherols and tocotrienols): vitamins A, C, D, E, K, thiamine (B1), riboflavin (B2), niacin (B3), pantothenic acid (B5), vitamin B6 (e.g., pyridoxine), biotin (B7), folate (B9), and cobalamin (B12). The requirement for vitamin D is conditional, as people who get sufficient exposure to ultraviolet light, either from the sun or an artificial source, synthesize vitamin D in the skin. Minerals
Document 4 (Title: Nutrition: Micronutrient Intake, Imbalances, and Interventions -- Definition/Introduction -- Water-Soluble Vitamins): Vitamin B12 (cobalamin): Vitamin B12 is a water-soluble vitamin that is a cofactor in synthesizing DNA, fatty acids, and myelin, as well as erythropoiesis and the development of the nervous system. [7] [29] Bacteria synthesize cobalamin in the gastrointestinal tract of animals, and the host later absorbs it. Because vitamin B12 is concentrated in animal tissues, it is virtually found only in animal products such as meat, dairy, and eggs. [29] [30] The RDA of vitamin B12 for adults is 2.4 mcg/d. [31]
Document 5 (Title: Vitamin): and four tocotrienols. Some sources list fourteen vitamins, by including choline, but major health organizations list thirteen: vitamin A (as all-trans-retinol, all-trans-retinyl-esters, as well as all-trans-beta-carotene and other provitamin A carotenoids), vitamin B1 (thiamine), vitamin B2 (riboflavin), vitamin B3 (niacin), vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid), vitamin B6 (pyridoxine), vitamin B7 (biotin), vitamin B9 (folic acid or folate), vitamin B12 (cobalamins), vitamin C (ascorbic acid), vitamin D (calciferols), vitamin E (tocopherols and tocotrienols), and vitamin K (phylloquinone and menaquinones).
Document 6 (Title: Calcium absorption and intestinal calcium-binding protein: quantitative relationship.): The concentration of the vitamin D-induced calcium-binding protein (CaBP) and calcium absorption from the duodenum were investigated in chicks with an in vivo ligated-loop technique. The relation between CaBP and calcium absorption was dependent on a) source of vitamin D activity (either vitamin D3 or 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol); b) dosage of vitamin D3; c) time after administration of vitamin D3 to rachitic animals. To aid in the interpretation of these results, a phenomenological model was developed in which CaBP was viewed as being linearly related to a portion of calcium absorption. The model, when applied to the data, suggests that there is a "nonfunctional" pool of CaBP the size of which is determined by the vitamin D status of the animal. After correction for this nonfunctional pool, the proportionality between CaBP and calcium absorption is independent of the vitamin D status of the animal.
Document 7 (Title: Biochemistry_Lippinco): A. Folic acid B. Folic acid and vitamin B12 C. Iron D. Vitamin C Correct answer = A. Macrocytic anemia is seen with deficiencies of folic acid, vitamin B12, or both. Vitamin B12 is utilized in only two reactions in the body: the remethylation of homocysteine (Hcy) to methionine, which also requires folic acid (as tetrahydrofolate [THF]), and the isomerization of methylmalonyl coenzyme A to succinyl coenzyme A, which does not require THF. The elevated Hcy and normal methylmalonic acid levels in the patient’s blood reflect a deficiency of folic acid as the cause of the macrocytic anemia. Iron deficiency causes microcytic anemia, as can vitamin C deficiency.
Document 8 (Title: Vitamin D Toxicity -- Epidemiology): According to the latest report from America's Poison Centers (APC), there were 11,718 cases of vitamin D exposure recorded in the National Poison Data System. More than half of these cases were in children younger than 5 years. The vast majority of cases were from unintentional exposures. The total number of vitamin D toxicity cases was greater than the total number of vitamin (vitamins B, A, C, and E) toxicity cases combined. This illustrates the widespread use of vitamin D supplements. [13]
Document 9 (Title: Vitamin D -- Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes): Very few foods are a natural source of vitamin D. These include oily fish such as salmon, mackerel, and sardines. Foods fortified with vitamin D are milk and orange juice, and some bread and cereals. An important source of oral vitamin D is vitamin D supplements, which are available both over the counter and through prescription. These are available in strengths of 1000 IU, 2000 IU, 5000 IU, and 50,000 IU, which are available only through prescription. [12] [13] By engaging in interprofessional collaboration, the healthcare team can ensure patients are adequately supplied with this vital nutrient and drive their patients to better health. [Level 5]

Document 11 (Title: Trace nutrients. 3 Magnesium, copper, zinc, vitamin B6, vitamin B12 and folic acid in the British household food supply.): 1. Intakes of magnesium, copper, zinc, vitamin B6, vitamin B12 and folic acid in Britain were calculated by applying the values selected for the 4th edition of McCance and Widdowson's The Composition of Foods (Paul &amp; Southgate, 1978) to the amounts of food recorded in the National Food Survey made during 1976 (Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, 1977). 2. National average intakes were (/person per d): Mg 249 mg, Cu 1.51 mg, Zn 9.1 mg, vitamin B6 1.36 mg, vitamin B12 6.6 micrograms free folic acid 105 microgram and total folic acid 190 micrograms. Corresponding intakes (/person) in families with four or more children were 10-20% lower. 3. A comparison of intakes with those recommended in Canada (Department of National Health and Welfare, 1976) and the USA (National Research Council, 1974) or by WHO (1973) indicated that for folic acid average values were particularly low, and only for vitamin B12 were the recommendations significantly exceeded. 4. Contributions from alcoholic drinks and confectionery were also calculated and found, on average, to be significant for cu, vitamin B12 and folic acid. 5. The losses of B-vitamins which might occur on cooking are discussed.

These children often have concurrent wasting and edema in addition to stunting. These children exhibit features of dermatitis, neurologic abnormalities, and fatty liver.
Document 13 (Title: Vitamin): Intake Sources For the most part, vitamins are obtained from the diet, but some are acquired by other means: for example, microorganisms in the gut flora produce vitamin K and biotin; and one form of vitamin D is synthesized in skin cells when they are exposed to a certain wavelength of ultraviolet light present in sunlight. Humans can produce some vitamins from precursors they consume: for example, vitamin A is synthesized from beta carotene; and niacin is synthesized from the amino acid tryptophan. Vitamin C can be synthesized by some species but not by others. Vitamin B12 is the only vitamin or nutrient not available from plant sources. The Food Fortification Initiative lists countries which have mandatory fortification programs for vitamins folic acid, niacin, vitamin A and vitamins B1, B2 and B12. Deficient intake
Document 14 (Title: Biochemistry, Nutrients -- Introduction): Nutrients are chemical substances required by the body to sustain basic functions and are optimally obtained by eating a balanced diet. There are six major classes of nutrients essential for human health: carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, vitamins, minerals, and water. Carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins are considered macronutrients and serve as a source of energy. Water is required in large amounts but does not yield energy. Vitamins and minerals are considered micronutrients and play essential roles in metabolism. Vitamins are organic micronutrients classified as either water-soluble or fat-soluble. The essential water-soluble vitamins include vitamins B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, B7, B9, B12, and C. The essential fat-soluble vitamins include vitamins A, E, D, and K. Minerals are inorganic micronutrients. Minerals can classify as macrominerals or microminerals. Macrominerals are required in amounts greater than 100 mg per day and include calcium, phosphorous, magnesium, sodium, potassium, and chloride. Sodium, potassium, and chloride are also electrolytes. Microminerals are those nutrients required in amounts less than 100 mg per day and include iron, copper, zinc, selenium, and iodine. This article will review the following biochemical aspects of the essential nutrients: fundamentals, cellular, molecular, function, testing, and clinical significance. [1] [2]
Document 15 (Title: Dietary supplement): (e.g. vitamin E includes tocopherols and tocotrienols, vitamin K includes vitamin K1 and K2). The list: vitamins A, C, D, E, K, Thiamine (B1), Riboflavin (B2), Niacin (B3), Pantothenic Acid (B5), Vitamin B6, Biotin (B7), Folate (B9) and Vitamin B12. Vitamin intake below recommended amounts can result in signs and symptoms associated with vitamin deficiency. There is little evidence of benefit when vitamins are consumed as a dietary supplement by those who are healthy and have a nutritionally adequate diet.
