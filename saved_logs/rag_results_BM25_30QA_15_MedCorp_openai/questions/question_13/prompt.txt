Document 1 (Title: Health Maintenance Organization -- Nursing, Allied Health, and Interprofessional Team Interventions): HMOs are a type of managed care designed to maintain the health of their patients cost-effectively. A primary method HMOs use to achieve these goals is to coordinate health services and care provided to patients. [15] Such care coordination requires collaboration among various members of the care team. Multiple strategies have sought to attempt to improve care coordination in managed care organizations such as HMOs. For example, explicitly defining the responsibility of each member of the care team is thought to improve coordination among members. [16] Financial risk-sharing strategies, such as bundled payments and capitated payments, shared among different care team members, can also incentivize increased collaboration for cost-efficient care. [17] Additionally, pharmacies have attempted to control costs without compromising care by using techniques such as drug formularies and prescribing protocols. [17] Ultimately, strategies that can incentivize communication among the various members of the care team and further align their goals can improve care coordination within an HMO.
Document 2 (Title: Multistrategy health education program to increase mammography use among women ages 65 and older.): Mammography use decreases with age although the risk of breast cancer increases with age. Medicare now provides biennial coverage for screening mammography. This study was designed to simulate the Medicare condition by subsidizing mammography among women in eight retirement communities in the metropolitan Philadelphia area. The study also measured the impact of health education interventions and the presence of a mobile mammography van on increased use of mammography. Retirement communities were assigned randomly to the control (cost subsidy alone) or experimental group (cost subsidy, mammography van, and tailored health education interventions). A total of 412 women ages 65 and older who had not had mammograms in the previous year were surveyed at baseline and 3 months later. Analytic techniques reflected the cluster nature of the randomization. Women in the experimental group were significantly more likely than the control group women to have obtained mammograms. Forty-five percent of the experimental group women compared with 12 percent of the control group women subsequently had mammograms in the 3 months after the baseline interview (P less than .001). Logistic regression analysis for mammography use indicated an odds ratio of 6.1 associated with being in the experimental group. For women in the experimental group, a separate logistic regression for mammography use showed an odds ratio of 7.8 associated with attendance at the educational presentation. The results suggest that Medicare coverage alone will not increase mammography use sufficiently to achieve year 2000 objectives. However, the addition of access enhancing and health education interventions boosts utilization dramatically.
Document 3 (Title: Mammography): Pain The mammography procedure can be painful. Reported pain rates range from 6-76%, with 23-95% experiencing pain or discomfort. Experiencing pain is a significant predictor in women not re-attending screening. There are few proven interventions to reduce pain in mammography, but evidence suggests that giving women information about the mammography procedure prior to it taking place may reduce the pain and discomfort experienced. Furthermore, research has found that standardised compression levels can help to reduce patients' pain while still allowing for optimal diagnostic images to be produced.
Document 4 (Title: Gynecology_Novak): Correlation of Findings Biopsy must be performed on patients with a dominant or suspicious mass despite absence of mammographic findings (48). Mammography should be performed before biopsy so other suspicious areas can be noted and the contralateral breast can be checked (Fig. 21.2). Mammography is never a substitute for biopsy because it may not reveal clinical cancer, especially when it occurs in the dense breast tissue of young women with fibrocystic changes. The sensitivity of mammography is 75%, with a specificity of 92.3% depending on the patient’s age; breast density; use of hormone therapy; and the size, location, and mammographic appearance of the tumor (49). Mammography is less sensitive in young women with dense breast tissue than in older women, who tend to have fatty breasts, in which mammography can detect at least 90% of malignancies (50). Small tumors, particularly those without calcifications, are more difficult to detect, especially in women with dense breasts.
Document 5 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Genetic screening for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations and other markers of breast cancer risk has identified a group of women at high risk for breast cancer. Unfortunately, when to begin and the optimal frequency of screening have not been defined. Mammography is less sensitive at detecting breast cancers in women carrying BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, possibly because such cancers occur in younger women, in whom mammography is known to be less sensitive. MRI screening may be more sensitive than mammography in women at high risk due to genetic predisposition or in women with very dense breast tissue, but specificity may be lower. An increase in overdiagnosis may accompany the higher sensitivity. The impact of MRI on breast cancer mortality with or without concomitant use of mammography has not been evaluated in a randomized controlled trial.
Document 6 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): in BRCA mutation carriers, provided it is performed and interpreted by an experienced radiologist with a high level of suspicion. Pres-ent screening recommendations for BRCA mutation carriers who do not undergo risk-reducing mastectomy include clinical breast examination every 6 months and mammography every 12 months beginning at age 25 years because the risk of breast cancer in BRCA mutation carriers increases after age 30 years. Recent attention has been focused on the use of MRI for breast cancer screening in high-risk individuals and known BRCA mutation carriers. MRI appears to be more sensitive at detect-ing breast cancer in younger women with dense breasts.113 How-ever, as noted previously, MRI does lead to the detection of benign breast lesions that cannot easily be distinguished from malignancy, and these false-positive events can result in more interventions, including biopsy specimens. The current recom-mendations from the American Cancer Society are for annual MRI in women
Document 7 (Title: Risk factors for breast cancer): There is debate as to whether the higher rate of breast cancer associated with obesity is due to a biological difference in the cancer itself, or differences in other factors such as health screen practices. It has been suggested that obesity may be a determinant for breast cancer screening by mammography. Seventeen scientific studies in the United States have found that as obesity increases in women over 40 years of age the rate of mammography reported decreases significantly. When stratified by race (white vs. black) there was a stronger relationship between obesity and lack of mammography screening among white women. Another study also found lower rates of mammography among those who were overweight and obese compared to those women who were of normal body mass index—this effect was only seen in white women. Obese women are more likely to list pain associated with mammograms as a reason for not getting screened; however, leaner women also list this as a reason for avoiding
Document 8 (Title: Ductal carcinoma in situ): Prognosis With treatment, the prognosis is excellent, with greater than 97% long-term survival. If untreated, DCIS progresses to invasive cancer in roughly one-third of cases, usually in the same breast and quadrant as the earlier DCIS. About 2% of women who are diagnosed with this condition and treated died within 10 years. Biomarkers can identify which women who were initially diagnosed with DCIS are at high or low risk of subsequent invasive cancer. Epidemiology DCIS is often detected with mammographies but can rarely be felt. With the increasing use of screening mammography, noninvasive cancers are more frequently diagnosed and now constitute 15% to 20% of all breast cancers. Cases of DCIS have increased 5 fold between 1983 and 2003 in the United States due to the introduction of screening mammography. In 2009 about 62,000 cases were diagnosed.

Document 9 (Title: Noise-induced hearing loss): A systematic review of the effectiveness of interventions to promote the use of hearing protection devices such as earplugs and earmuffs among workers found that tailored interventions improve the average use of such devices when compared with no intervention. Tailored interventions involve the use of communication or other types of interventions that are specific to an individual or a group and aim to change behavior. Mixed interventions such as mailings, distribution of hearing protection devices, noise assessments, and hearing testing are also more effective in improving the use of hearing protection devices compared with hearing testing alone. Programs that increased the proportion of workers wearing hearing protection equipment did reduce overall hearing loss. Hearing conservation programs
Document 10 (Title: Effect of continuing medical education and cost reduction on physician compliance with mammography screening guidelines.): Primary care physicians perform breast cancer screening in women aged 50 years and older less frequently than recommended by national guidelines. A multimethod continuing medical education (CME) intervention was tested in an attempt to increase breast cancer screening practices in a predominantly fee-for-service practice community in New York State. Preintervention and postintervention surveys of primary care physicians were conducted in 1988 and 1990, respectively. Project-initiated, low-cost mammography in one town and the unanticipated provision of free mammography services in another town under nonproject auspices permitted a comparison to be made between these towns and towns where mammography screening was provided at the prevailing fees to determine the impact that cost has on physicians' referral of women patients for mammography. Physicians practicing in the towns in which the CME intervention was provided showed a significant increase, consistent across specialty groups and greatest among family physicians, in the number of reported mammography referrals of asymptomatic women aged 50 to 75 years. Changes in the CME control town were smaller and not statistically significant for the sample size available. The increase in compliance was as large in the CME-intervention towns, one without (19%) and one with low-cost mammography (20%), as the increase in the town with free mammography alone (18%). There were no significant increases in reported performance of breast examination. A multimethod program of CME is a feasible approach to increasing community physician compliance with mammography screening guidelines, particularly among family physicians, and can enhance the impact of reduced cost or have at least the equivalent effect of free mammography services.
Document 11 (Title: Older women's participation in breast screening.): The incidence of breast cancer increases with age, but women's participation in breast screening decreases with age. National and regional surveys indicate a number of barriers. Women over age 65 are more likely to say they have never heard of mammograms, that they did not know they needed them, and that their doctors did not recommend them. In a study conducted at Fox Chase Cancer Center, in Philadelphia, participation in an HMO-sponsored breast screening program appeared to reverse the usual age-related decrease in mammography. If mammography utilization is to increase in women over age 65, physicians must offer unambiguous referrals to older women. In addition, health education interventions are needed to improve knowledge and beliefs of older women and their physicians. And, finally, strategies also are needed to enhance access. With the advent of Medicare coverage, payment will be less of a barrier. But other barriers remain.
Document 12 (Title: Breast cancer screening): Breast exam Breast examination (either clinical breast exams (CBE) by a health care provider or by self exams) were once widely recommended. They however are not supported by evidence and may, like mammography and other screening methods that produce false positive results, contribute to harm. The use of screening in women without symptoms and at low risk is thus controversial. A 2003 Cochrane review found screening by breast self-examination is not associated with lower death rates among women who report performing breast self-examination and does, like other breast cancer screening methods, increase harms, in terms of increased numbers of benign lesions identified and an increased number of biopsies performed. They conclude "at present, breast self-examination cannot be recommended". There was no high quality evidence looking at clinical breast examination. Mammography
Document 13 (Title: Cancer Screening -- Function -- Breast Cancer): As mammography rates remained constant during this period, the recent rise in breast cancer incidence cannot be attributed to increased detection through mammography. However, due to breast cancer screening, most cases are diagnosed at stage I, which has a 5-year survival rate of 100%. [6] From 1989 to 2015, breast cancer mortality dropped by 39%. The mortality rate among women aged 50 and older has continued to decline since 2007, while it has remained steady for women aged 50 or younger. [7] Widely accepted breast cancer screening modalities include mammography, breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT), breast ultrasound, and breast self-examinations.
Document 14 (Title: Surgery_Schwartz): used continue to be mod-ified and improved to enhance image quality.137-140 Conventional mammography delivers a radiation dose of 0.1 cGy per study. By comparison, chest radiography delivers 25% of this dose. However, there is no increased breast cancer risk associated with the radiation dose delivered with screening mammography. Screening mammography is used to detect unexpected breast cancer in asymptomatic women. In this regard, it supplements history taking and physical examination. With screening mam-mography, two views of the breast are obtained: the craniocau-dal (CC) view (Fig. 17-20A,B) and the mediolateral oblique (MLO) view (Fig. 17-20C,D). The MLO view images the great-est volume of breast tissue, including the upper outer quadrant and the axillary tail of Spence. Compared with the MLO view, the CC view provides better visualization of the medial aspect of the breast and permits greater breast compression. Diagnos-tic mammography is used to evaluate women with abnormal
Document 15 (Title: Health Maintenance Organization -- Issues of Concern): HMOs increased in popularity following the passage of the HMO Act in 1973, which sought to increase the usage of HMOs to improve patient care, decrease health care costs, and put a greater emphasis on preventative health care. [3] [4] In the years following the HMO Act, HMOs became a prominent method of health insurance in the United States. For example, by 1987, over 29 million Americans (12%) received care through HMOs. [1] As such, it is useful for health care providers to understand HMOs and their features.
