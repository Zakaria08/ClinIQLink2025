With your own knowledge and the help of the following document:

Document 1 (Title: Metronidazole -- Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes): There should be judicious prescribing of metronidazole by providers only for known indications and high clinical suspicion for needing treatment of anaerobic bacterial infections, protozoal infections, and microaerophilic bacterial infections. Overprescribing may contribute to increasing future antibiotic resistance to the drug, so a pharmacy consult is necessary for the prescriber to ensure directed therapy. The documentation already exists regarding increased resistance to metronidazole in the treatment of C. difficile infections. Also, prescribers, nurses, and pharmacists should routinely educate patients to abstain from alcoholic beverages while taking metronidazole, which will help lead to fewer disulfiram reaction symptoms; nursing will play a role in this monitoring and for other potential adverse effects. The patient should also be informed by the health care provider of the possible change in urine color while on this medicine. The team of health professionals, including physicians, physician assistants, nurses, and pharmacists, must work together to provide the best care for these patients when using metronidazole in any formulation. [Level 5]
Document 2 (Title: Nitroimidazole): Nitroimidazole antibiotics From the chemistry perspective, nitroimidazole antibiotics can be classified according to the location of the nitro functional group. Structures with names 4- and 5-nitroimidazole are equivalent from the perspective of drugs since these tautomers readily interconvert. Drugs of the 5-nitro variety include metronidazole, tinidazole, nimorazole, dimetridazole, pretomanid, ornidazole, megazol, and azanidazole. Drugs based on 2-nitromidazoles include benznidazole. Nitroimidazole antibiotics have been used to combat anaerobic bacterial and parasitic infections. Perhaps the most common example is metronidazole. Other heterocycles such as nitrothiazoles (thiazole) are also used for this purpose. Nitroheterocycles may be reductively activated in hypoxic cells, and then undergo redox recycling or decompose to toxic products. References Disulfiram-like drugs
Document 3 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): Adverse effects include nausea, diarrhea, stomatitis, and peripheral neuropathy with prolonged use. Metronidazole has a disulfiram-like effect, and patients should be instructed to avoid alcohol. Although teratogenic in some animals, metronidazole has not been associated with this effect in humans. Other properties of metronidazole are discussed in Chapter 52. A structurally similar agent, tinidazole, is a once-daily drug approved for treatment of trichomonas infection, giardiasis, amebiasis, and bacterial vaginosis. It also is active against anaerobic bacteria, but is not approved in the USA for treatment of anaerobic infections.
Document 4 (Title: Acetaldehyde dehydrogenase): The drug disulfiram (Antabuse) prevents the oxidation of acetaldehyde to acetic acid and is used in the treatment of alcoholism. ALDH1 is strongly inhibited by disulfiram, while ALDH2 is resistant to its effect. The cysteine residue at 302 in ALDH1 and 200 in ALDH2 is implicated as a disulfiram binding site on the enzyme and serves as a disfulfiram sensitive thiol site. Covalent binding of disulfiram to the thiol blocks the binding of one of the cysteine residues with iodoacetamide, thereby inactivating the enzyme and significantly lowering catalytic activity. Activity can be recovered by treatment with 2-mercaptoethanol, although not with glutathione. Metronidazole (Flagyl), which is used to treat certain parasitic infections as well as pseudomembranous colitis, causes similar effects to disulfiram. Coprine (which is an amino acid found in certain coprinoid mushrooms) metabolizes in vivo to 1-aminocyclopropanol which causes similar effects as well.
Document 5 (Title: Gynecology_Novak): Treatment Ideally, treatment of BV should inhibit anaerobes but not vaginal lactobacilli. The following treatments are effective: 1. Metronidazole, an antibiotic with excellent activity against anaerobes but poor activity against lactobacilli, is the drug of choice for the treatment of BV. A dose of 500 mg administered orally twice a day for 7 days should be used. Patients should be advised to avoid using alcohol during treatment with oral metronidazole and for 24 hours thereafter. 2. Metronidazole gel, 0.75%, one applicator (5 g) intravaginally once daily for 5 days, may also be prescribed. The overall cure rates range from 75% to 84% with the aforementioned regimens (16). Clindamycin in the following regimens is effective in treating BV: 1. Clindamycin ovules, 100 mg, intravaginally once at bedtime for 3 days 2. Clindamycin bioadhesive cream, 2%, 100 mg intravaginally in a single dose 3. Clindamycin cream, 2%, one applicator full (5 g) intravaginally at bedtime for 7 days 4.
Document 6 (Title: Guidelines for clinical care: anti-infective agents for intra-abdominal infection. A Surgical Infection Society policy statement.): Several antibiotics have been marketed for therapeutic use in intra-abdominal infection. Often, these agents do not provide a sufficient spectrum activity against both facultative and obligate anaerobic gram-negative organisms, or have certain toxic effects that would not otherwise support their use. Guidelines have been developed for selection of antibiotic therapy for intra-abdominal infections and are presented as a statement of the Surgical Infection Society endorsed by the Executive Council. These guidelines are restricted to infections derived from the gastrointestinal tract and deal with those microorganisms commonly seen in such infections. The recommendations are based on in vitro activity against enteric bacteria, experience in animal models, and documented efficacy in clinical trials. Other concerns regarding pharmacokinetics, mechanisms of action, microbial resistance, and safety were also used in the formation of these guidelines. For community-acquired infections of mild to moderate severity, single-agent therapy with cefoxitin, cefotetan, or cefmetazole or ticarcillin-clavulanic acid is recommended. For more severe infections, single-agent therapy with carbapenems (imipenem/cilastatin) or combination therapy with either a third-generation cephalosporin, a monobactam (aztreonam), or an aminoglycoside plus clindamycin or metronidazole is recommended. Regimens with little or no activity against facultative gram-negative rods or anaerobic gram-negative rods are not considered acceptable.
Document 7 (Title: Pharmacokinetics and therapeutic efficacy of metronidazole at different dosages.): Metronidazole, a drug effective against certain protozoal and anaerobic infections, was given female patients with Trichomoniasis urogenitalis. Group I received twice daily 250 mg of metronidazole (supplied as 250 mg tablets Vagimid). Group II received in a single dose 1.0 g (4 tablets); and group III, 2.0 g (8 tablets). Serum and urine metronidazole levels were measured polarographically. Kinetic parameters were determined from the measured values of the concentration time curve by a computing program. An exact control of the therapeutic result was carried out. In all patients peak serum levels occurred within 1-3 hr and averaged 5.1 +/- 1.7 microgram/ml after 250 mg doses, 19.6 +/- 3.8 microgram/ml after 1.0 g doses and 40.6 +/- 9.3 microgram/ml after 2.0 g doses. About 35% of the administered dose was recovered in the urine in 12 hr and about 50% in 24 hr. Metronidazole shows protein binding of 10-20% equally in vivo and in vitro. Minimum trichomonacidic concentrations of nearly 1 microgram/ml were still present 12 hr after oral application of 250 mg metronidazole, and 24 hr to 36 hr, respectively after 1.0 g and 2.0 g daily doses. The cure rate was 100%. No serious side effects ocurred in any of the patients.
Document 8 (Title: Toxic leukoencephalopathy): Medication neurotoxicity Besides its role in chemotherapy, methotrexate is also used as an orally administered treatment for rheumatoid arthritis. Leukoencephalopathy can develop from long-term treatment of methotrexate even at low doses. In contrast to intravenous methotrexate for cancer patients, leukoencephalopathy induced by orally taken methotrexate may be associated with cognitive dysfunction and even death. Oxycodone is the main active ingredient in various oral pain relief medications. High doses of opiates such as oxycodone can lead to leukoencephalopathy. The activity of various opioid and nociceptive receptors appear to play a role in the disease; however, the exact mechanism remains unknown. Metronidazole, an antibiotic used to treat aerobic and protozoal infections, has been known at high doses to produce neurologic symptoms associated with toxic leukoencephalopathy.
Document 9 (Title: Antiparasitic Drugs -- Mechanism of Action -- Antiprotozoal Agents): Metronidazole and tinidazole are 5-nitroimidazole derivatives. Metronidazole has both antibacterial and antiprotozoal properties. It is active against amoebiasis and other protozoal diseases such as trichomoniasis and giardiasis. Within the parasites, it engages in redox reactions, releasing toxic reactive intermediates, making it effective as a luminal and extra-luminal amoebicide. The metronidazole metabolites are taken up by the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), leading to the DNA disruption and, consequently, protein synthesis inhibition. Tinidazole has a similar structure to metronidazole and shares a similar activity profile. However, tinidazole has a higher cure rate for protozoal infections and a better toxicity profile than metronidazole.
Document 10 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): Metronidazole is well absorbed after oral administration, is widely distributed in tissues, and reaches serum levels of 4–6 mcg/mL after a 250-mg oral dose. It can also be given intravenously. The drug penetrates well into the cerebrospinal fluid and brain, reaching levels similar to those in serum. Metronidazole is metabolized in the liver and may accumulate in hepatic insufficiency. Metronidazole is indicated for treatment of anaerobic or mixed intra-abdominal infections (in combination with other agents with activity against aerobic organisms), vaginitis (trichomonas infection, bacterial vaginosis), Clostridium difficile infection, and brain abscess. The typical dosage is 500 mg three times daily orally or intravenously (30 mg/kg/d). Vaginitis may respond to a single 2-g dose. A vaginal gel is available for topical use.
Document 11 (Title: Ascending cholangitis): Treatment Fluids and antibiotics Cholangitis requires admission to hospital. Intravenous fluids are administered, especially if the blood pressure is low, and antibiotics are commenced. Empirical treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics is usually necessary until it is known for certain which pathogen is causing the infection, and to which antibiotics it is sensitive. Combinations of penicillins and aminoglycosides are widely used, although ciprofloxacin has been shown to be effective in most cases, and may be preferred to aminoglycosides because of fewer side effects. Metronidazole is often added to specifically treat the anaerobic pathogens, especially in those who are very ill or at risk of anaerobic infections. Antibiotics are continued for 7–10 days. Drugs that increase the blood pressure (vasopressors) may also be required to counter the low blood pressure.
Document 12 (Title: Tinidazole: a review of its antiprotozoal activity and therapeutic efficacy.): Tinidazole, a synthetic imidazole derivative, has been used in the oral treatment of several protozoal infections - trichomoniasis, giardiasis and amoebiasis. Among the protozoal organisms inhibited by tinidazole are Trichomonas vaginalis, Trichomonas foetus, and Entamoeba histolytica. In vitro, tinidazole has been shown to possess antiprotozoal activity at least comparable to, and in some cases greater than, metronidazole. Tinidazole also has activity against some Gram-negative anaerobic bacilli, including Bacteroides spp. Following oral administration of a 2g dose, like metronidazole serum levels peak in about 2 hours but persist for longer. Any clinical significance of the longer plasma half-life (tinidazole 12.5h; metronidazole 7.3h) has yet to be demonstrated. Tinidazole is approximately 20% bound to plasma proteins. Only unchanged drug has been found in the plasma and urine of tinidazole-treated subjects, although metabolites have been detected in animal studies. A single 2g dose of tinidazole has been shown to be effective therapy in vaginal trichomoniasis and in urogenital trichomoniasis in males. Single-dose therapy in general offers advantages in regard to convenience, and in the treatment of a sexually transmissible disease such as trichomoniasis, single-dose therapy facilitates compliance of patient and sexual partner. In comparative studies, tinidazole, in both single-dose and traditional multiple-dose regimens, has been shown to be equivalent and often superior to other antitrichomonal agents, including metronidazole. In intestinal amoebiasis, tinidazole has been evaluated after both once-a-day and multiple daily dose regimens, with the former giving slightly better results. When both metronidazole and tinidazole were administered in multiple daily dose regimens, the two agents yielded similar cure rates; in one study fewer tinidazole-treated patients required a second course. Tinidazole has also been successful in some cases of amoebic liver abscess, but an advantage over metronidazole has not been demonstrated. Results in the treatment of giardiasis, especially with the single-dose regimen, are promising, and in one study, tinidazole proved effective in infections resistant to metronidazole. Even in large doses, tinidazole has been well tolerated, although rarely vomiting may occur and the patient may need to be re-treated with a multiple dose regimen.
Document 13 (Title: Vancomycin, metronidazole, and tetracyclines.): Over the last 30 years, the impurities in the vancomycin product have been reduced, perhaps resulting in a lower rate of adverse reactions. Vancomycin is bactericidal against most susceptible organisms, but is bacteriostatic against the enterococcus. Vancomycin is the drug of choice for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Vancomycin attains good tissue and bone penetration and must be administered intravenously for systemic infections. It is eliminated renally with a half-life of about 6 hours; this half-life is prolonged with advanced age and reduced renal function. Significant adverse reactions can be minimized with careful attention to administration technique. Metronidazole has excellent tissue penetration; its antibacterial site of action is within anaerobic bacterial cells. Metronidazole is cleared by hepatic metabolism with a half-life of about 7 to 8 hours. The half-life is unchanged with renal dysfunction but is prolonged in patients with hepatic function impairment. Although adverse effects are relatively minor, there is an important interaction with warfarin. For podiatric infections, metronidazole can be used in skin- and soft-tissue infections; anaerobes in bone and joint infections are rare. Topical metronidazole has been used successfully in the treatment of decubitus ulcers, and this needs further evaluation. The most commonly used tetracyclines are tetracycline, doxycycline, and minocycline. The tetracyclines are broad spectrum antimicrobial agents, but their usefulness is limited by resistant strains. Tetracycline's absorption is significantly impaired by food, and it is cleared renally and fecally. Doxycycline has the highest protein binding and the longest half-life; it is cleared both renally and fecally without hepatic metabolism. Minocycline has the best absorption and tissue penetration; the unchanged drug is cleared renally and fecally, and it also undergoes hepatic metabolism. All tetracyclines have important adverse reactions with respect to teeth and bones, and they are contraindicated during pregnancy and for children under age eight.
Document 14 (Title: Quinolones -- Indications): Quinolones are a class of broad-spectrum antibiotics with excellent oral bioavailability and can be used to treat a wide variety of bacterial infections. Their clinical utility is restricted, particularly in the outpatient setting, due to their potential for severe side effects. Due to these safety concerns, quinolones are not recommended as first-line agents by the FDA if there are other available antibiotic options with less potential for severe adverse events. There are currently four generations of quinolones. While initial quinolones were effective only against Gram-negative bacteria, succeeding generations gained activity against Pseudomonas sp ., Gram-positive, and atypical bacterial strains. Many different quinolones have undergone development, and among them, the ones currently approved by the FDA for systemic use include moxifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, gemifloxacin, levofloxacin, delafloxacin, and ofloxacin. A few key differences exist in the spectrum of activity between the quinolones. Ciprofloxacin is ineffective against S. pneumoniae . Moxifloxacin lacks sufficient activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa but is effective in treating anaerobes (along with delafloxacin). Delafloxacin is the only quinolone effective against methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). [1]
Document 15 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): The antibiotics used to treat anaerobic infections should be active against both aerobic and anaerobic organisms because many of these infections are of mixed etiology. Antibiotic regimens can usually be selected empirically on the basis of the type of infection, the species of the organisms usually present in such cases, the results of Gram’s staining, and a knowledge of antimicrobial resistance patterns (Chap. 170 and Table 201-2). Other factors influencing the selection of antibiotics include need for bactericidal activity and for penetration into certain organs (such as the brain), toxicity, and impact on the normal microbiota. Antibiotics active against clinically relevant anaerobes can be grouped into four categories based on their predicted activity (Table 201-2). Nearly all the drugs listed have toxic side effects, which are described in detail in Chap. 170.
