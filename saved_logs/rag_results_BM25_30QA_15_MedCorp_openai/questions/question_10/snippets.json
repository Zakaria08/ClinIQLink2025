        "content": "Programmed cell death (PCD) is a fundamental component of development in virtually all animals. Despite the ubiquity of this phenomenon, little is known about what tells a cell to die, and less still about the physiological and molecular mechanisms that bring about death. One system that has proven to be very amenable for the study of PCD is the intersegmental muscle (ISM) of the tobacco hawkmoth Manduca sexta. These giant muscle cells are used during the eclosion (emergence) behavior of the adult moth, and then die during the subsequent 30 h. This review uses the ISMs as a model system to address questions that are basic to any cell death system, including the following: (1) how do cells know when to die; (2) what physiological changes accompany death; (3) what are the molecular mechanisms that mediate death; and (4) do all cells die by the same process? For the ISMs, the trigger for PCD is a decline in the circulating titer of the insect molting hormone, 20-hydroxyecdysone (20-HE). During cell death there are rapid decreases in both the myofibrillar sensitivity to intracellular calcium and the resulting force of fiber contraction. The ability of the ISMs to undergo PCD requires the repression and activation of specific genes. Two of the repressed genes encode actin and myosin. One of the upregulated presumptive cell-death genes encodes polyubiquitin, which appears to play a critical role in the rapid proteolysis that accompanies ISM death.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Cardiac remodeling occurs in response to stress, either functional stress or structural stress. This remodeling plays a vital role in the disease process that ensues. Initially, the electrical and structural remodeling helps in compensating the cardiac performance. But over time, these compensatory mechanisms often lead to pump failure and/or fatal arrhythmias.

        "content": "The cellular slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum is a microorganism in which growth and development are strictly separated. Starvation initiates a developmental program in which extracellular cAMP plays a major role as a signal molecule. In response to cAMP several second messengers are produced, including cAMP, cGMP and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, (Ins(1,4,5)P3). Ins(1,4,5)P3 levels are controlled by the activation of phosphoinositidase C and the activity of the Ins(1,4,5)P3-degrading phosphatases. In Dictyostelium discoideum two major routes for the dephosphorylation of Ins(1,4,5)P3 are present: a 5-phosphatase, which hydrolyses Ins(1,4,5)P3 at the 5-position producing Ins(1,4)P2 as in vertebrate cells, and a 1-phosphatase which removes the 1-phosphate, giving Ins(4,5)P2, as in plants. In this paper we show that at the onset of development both the 1-phosphatase and the 5-phosphatase are present in equal amounts. During development the 5-phosphatase disappears leaving the 1-phosphatase as the single enzyme to remove Ins(1,4,5)P3. We conclude that during development Dictyostelium discoideum switches from a mixed type of Ins(1,4,5)P3 degradation to a more plant-like degradation pathway.",

In hepatocytes, oxidative stress causes an increase in cytosolic calcium, a process which is thought to be largely responsible for subsequent cell death. The oxidation of glutathione precedes a flux of calcium into the cytoplasm from internal and external sources. The possibility that similar events occur in plant cells has been tested using strips of epidermis taken from leaves of Commelina communis. The closure of stomata in response to many chemical or physical stimuli is thought to involve a transient rise in cytosolic calcium. Paraquat (10(-4) M) and hydrogen peroxide (10(-3) M) caused a marked reduction in stomatal aperture when included in the incubation medium of illuminated epidermal strips. The calcium channel blocker verapamil (10(-5) M) protected stomata from hydrogen peroxide-induced closure while the ion chelator EGTA (2 x 10(-3) M) protected stomata in both oxidising treatments. These results are discussed in so far as they support the hypothesis that a rise in cytosolic calcium may play a role in the pathology of oxidative stress in plant cells through a mechanism analogous to the liver cell system.",
