        "content": "Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) occurs in approximately 1 in 2,500-3,500 live births and represents a significant cause of respiratory distress in the neonatal period. The embryological basis involves defective formation of the diaphragm during weeks 4-12 of gestation, with several potential mechanisms depending on the specific anatomical variant. In most cases (80-85%), a posterolateral defect (Bochdalek hernia) results from incomplete fusion of the pleuroperitoneal membrane, which normally separates the pleural and peritoneal cavities during embryological development. This defect permits abdominal viscera to herniate into the thoracic cavity during a critical period of lung development. Left-sided defects predominate (80-85%) over right-sided ones (15-20%) due to earlier closure of the right pleuroperitoneal canal and the protective presence of the liver on the right side. The embryological timing of the diaphragmatic defect directly correlates with the severity of pulmonary hypoplasia, as herniated abdominal contents compete for thoracic space during crucial stages of lung development. Ultrasound diagnosis typically identifies the gastric fundus within the thoracic cavity as a pathognomonic finding in left-sided CDH, alongside mediastinal shift away from the affected side. This contrasts with other embryological anomalies such as annular pancreas, where pancreatic tissue encircles the duodenum causing intestinal obstruction, or hypertrophic pyloric stenosis, which develops postnatally rather than being a true embryological defect. Herniation through the inguinal canal represents a distinct pathophysiological process unrelated to diaphragmatic development.",

        "title": "Differential Diagnosis of Infantile Vomiting Disorders",
        "content": "Non-bilious vomiting in the neonatal and early infancy periods represents a diagnostic challenge, with potential etiologies ranging from relatively benign conditions to life-threatening surgical emergencies. When presenting in the 2-8 week age range, infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS) emerges as a principal consideration. This acquired condition involves progressive hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the circular muscle layer of the pylorus, resulting in gastric outlet obstruction. The pathophysiology involves abnormal innervation of the pylorus with deficient inhibitory neurons containing nitric oxide synthase, leading to uncoordinated contractions and subsequent muscular hypertrophy. This differs fundamentally from congenital anomalies present at birth, such as duodenal atresia, which typically manifests with bilious vomiting within the first 24-48 hours of life due to obstruction distal to the ampulla of Vater. Similarly, annular pancreas, where pancreatic tissue encircles the duodenum, presents with early obstruction and bilious emesis. Gastroschisis and other midline defects resulting from failed ventral wall fusion present with visible abdominal wall defects rather than isolated vomiting. The classic presentation of pyloric stenosis includes progressive, projectile non-bilious vomiting, visible peristaltic waves, and, on careful examination, a palpable 'olive' in the right upper quadrant representing the hypertrophied pylorus. Ultrasound confirmation demonstrates increased pyloric muscle thickness (>3mm) and elongated pyloric channel (>14mm).",

        "title": "Diagnostic Approach to Preeclampsia",
        "content": "Hypertensive disorders complicate 5-10% of pregnancies and contribute significantly to maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality worldwide. Preeclampsia, a pregnancy-specific multisystem disorder characterized by hypertension and end-organ dysfunction after 20 weeks gestation, affects approximately 3-5% of pregnancies. Early detection through regular prenatal assessments remains crucial for optimizing maternal and fetal outcomes. The contemporary diagnostic criteria for preeclampsia focus on both blood pressure parameters and evidence of maternal organ dysfunction. Hypertension, defined as systolic blood pressure \u2265140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure \u226590 mmHg on two occasions at least four hours apart, represents the fundamental requirement. Proteinuria, historically considered mandatory for diagnosis, is now recognized as just one of several possible indicators of end-organ involvement. Quantification of urinary protein excretion through 24-hour urine collection remains the gold standard assessment, with significant proteinuria defined as \u2265300 mg in 24 hours or a protein/creatinine ratio \u22650.3 mg/dL in a random sample. Other laboratory evaluations, including liver function tests and coagulation studies, help assess hepatic involvement and potential HELLP syndrome (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets). Leukocytosis may occur but lacks specificity for preeclampsia. Clinical manifestations often include rapid weight gain and generalized edema, particularly facial and periorbital, distinguishing it from dependent edema commonly observed in normal pregnancy. Progressive symptoms including headache, visual disturbances, and epigastric pain suggest impending eclampsia, necessitating urgent intervention.",
