Document 1 (Title: Current Recommendations for Reducing Sudden Infant Death Syndrome Risk): Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) remains a leading cause of death in infants between one month and one year of age, with peak incidence between two and four months. Following comprehensive epidemiological studies and the introduction of targeted preventive measures, SIDS rates have declined significantly over the past three decades. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and similar organizations worldwide have established evidence-based recommendations focusing on modifiable risk factors. The single most effective intervention involves infant sleep positioning, with clear evidence demonstrating that placing infants on their backs (supine position) on a firm sleep surface reduces SIDS risk by approximately 50%. This 'Back to Sleep' campaign has been credited with the dramatic reduction in SIDS rates since its introduction in the 1990s. Contrary to previous practices, maintaining a high ambient room temperature and excessive bundling are now recognized as potential risk factors rather than protective measures. Similarly, the use of positioning devices, wedges, or rolled blankets to maintain sleep position is discouraged due to suffocation risks. While some studies suggested that pacifier use during sleep might confer modest protective effects, avoiding pacifiers was not found to reduce SIDS risk. Current guidelines emphasize room-sharing without bed-sharing, avoiding soft bedding or objects in the sleep environment, and eliminating exposure to tobacco smoke as additional key preventive strategies.
Document 2 (Title: Zoonotic Viral Encephalitides: Modes of Transmission and Clinical Manifestations): Rabies virus, a neurotropic rhabdovirus of the Lyssavirus genus, represents one of the most lethal infectious diseases, with near-universal fatality once clinical symptoms develop. Transmission typically occurs through percutaneous exposure to infected saliva via animal bites, though alternative routes including mucosal exposure and aerosol inhalation have been documented in specific environmental contexts. The pathophysiological sequence begins at the inoculation site, where initial viral replication occurs within muscle tissue. Subsequently, the virus enters peripheral nerves, exploiting retrograde axonal transport to access the central nervous system. This neural progression explains the variable incubation period (typically 3-12 weeks) influenced by wound location and distance from the central nervous system. Prodromal symptoms include fever, malaise, headache, and often paresthesia or pruritus at the inoculation site. As the infection progresses to the clinical stage, patients develop the pathognomonic features of encephalitic (furious) rabies: hyperexcitability, autonomic dysfunction, hydrophobia, aerophobia, and ultimately paralysis leading to respiratory failure. Hydrophobia, the characteristic fear of water, stems from painful pharyngeal muscle spasms triggered by swallowing attempts, while hypersalivation results from dysphagia combined with increased secretion. The paralytic form presents with ascending flaccid paralysis resembling Guillain-Barré syndrome, complicating early diagnosis. Exposure risk varies significantly by geographic region and animal reservoir. Traditional sources include canids (dogs, foxes, wolves), raccoons, and skunks, though any mammal may potentially transmit the virus. Bats represent a particularly concerning vector due to their widespread distribution, potential for inapparent exposure through minor bites, and documented transmission through inhalation of aerosolized viral particles in enclosed spaces with dense bat populations. Cave exploration (spelunking), particularly in bat-inhabited caves, represents a recognized risk factor, with multiple documented cases of presumed aerosol transmission in cavers without recognized bat bites. Preventive measures focus on post-exposure prophylaxis, including wound cleansing, rabies immune globulin, and vaccination, which remains highly effective when promptly administered following exposure.
Document 3 (Title: Life-Threatening Antipsychotic Adverse Reactions): Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) represents a potentially fatal adverse reaction to antipsychotic medications, characterized by a distinctive tetrad of fever, rigidity, altered mental status, and autonomic instability. While traditionally associated with first-generation (typical) antipsychotics, particularly high-potency agents such as haloperidol, all antipsychotics—including second-generation (atypical) agents like risperidone—carry this risk, albeit with varying incidence. The pathophysiological mechanism centrally involves dopamine receptor blockade in the nigrostriatal pathway and hypothalamus, leading to dysregulated muscle activity and temperature regulation. Increasing evidence suggests additional contributions from sympathoadrenal hyperactivity and direct peripheral effects on skeletal muscle. Risk factors include rapid dose escalation, high-potency agents, parenteral administration, concurrent lithium therapy, dehydration, and possibly genetic predisposition affecting dopamine receptor sensitivity or serotonin pathway modulation. Clinical manifestations typically evolve over 24-72 hours following antipsychotic initiation or dose increase. Hyperthermia, often exceeding 38.5°C, represents a cardinal feature, accompanied by lead-pipe muscle rigidity, diaphoresis, and labile vital signs. Laboratory abnormalities include markedly elevated creatine kinase (often >1000 U/L) reflecting rhabdomyolysis, leukocytosis, electrolyte disturbances, and myoglobinuria potentially culminating in acute kidney injury. Management centers on immediate discontinuation of the offending agent, supportive care addressing hyperthermia and dehydration, and consideration of specific pharmacological interventions. Benzodiazepines provide symptomatic relief for agitation and rigidity while dantrolene may directly address hypertonicity through peripheral mechanisms. Dopaminergic agents such as bromocriptine theoretically counteract the central dopamine blockade, though evidence for their efficacy remains limited. Antipyretics demonstrate minimal effectiveness as fever derives from muscle hypermetabolism rather than altered hypothalamic set-point. Complications include respiratory compromise from chest wall rigidity, acute renal failure from myoglobinuria, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and cardiopulmonary arrest. Similar hyperthermia syndromes include serotonin syndrome, malignant hyperthermia, and anticholinergic toxicity, differentiated by exposure history and specific clinical features.

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
Question: A 27-year-old man presents to the emergency room with persistent fever, nausea, and vomiting for the past 3 days. While waiting to be seen, he quickly becomes disoriented and agitated. Upon examination, he has visible signs of difficulty breathing with copious oral secretions and generalized muscle twitching. The patient’s temperature is 104°F (40°C), blood pressure is 90/64 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min with an oxygen saturation of 90% on room air. When the nurse tries to place a nasal cannula, the patient becomes fearful and combative. The patient is sedated and placed on mechanical ventilation. Which of the following is a risk factor for the patient’s most likely diagnosis?
Options:
A. Contaminated beef
B. Epiglottic cyst
C. Mosquito bite
D. Spelunking
