Document 1 (Title: Diagnostic Approach to Preeclampsia): Hypertensive disorders complicate 5-10% of pregnancies and contribute significantly to maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality worldwide. Preeclampsia, a pregnancy-specific multisystem disorder characterized by hypertension and end-organ dysfunction after 20 weeks gestation, affects approximately 3-5% of pregnancies. Early detection through regular prenatal assessments remains crucial for optimizing maternal and fetal outcomes. The contemporary diagnostic criteria for preeclampsia focus on both blood pressure parameters and evidence of maternal organ dysfunction. Hypertension, defined as systolic blood pressure ≥140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mmHg on two occasions at least four hours apart, represents the fundamental requirement. Proteinuria, historically considered mandatory for diagnosis, is now recognized as just one of several possible indicators of end-organ involvement. Quantification of urinary protein excretion through 24-hour urine collection remains the gold standard assessment, with significant proteinuria defined as ≥300 mg in 24 hours or a protein/creatinine ratio ≥0.3 mg/dL in a random sample. Other laboratory evaluations, including liver function tests and coagulation studies, help assess hepatic involvement and potential HELLP syndrome (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets). Leukocytosis may occur but lacks specificity for preeclampsia. Clinical manifestations often include rapid weight gain and generalized edema, particularly facial and periorbital, distinguishing it from dependent edema commonly observed in normal pregnancy. Progressive symptoms including headache, visual disturbances, and epigastric pain suggest impending eclampsia, necessitating urgent intervention.
Document 2 (Title: Infectious Complications and Management of Mammalian Bites): Mammalian bite wounds represent a significant cause of emergency department visits, with dog bites accounting for 80-90% of all reported cases. While immediate traumatic complications demand attention, infection risk represents the principal concern guiding therapeutic decision-making. The infectious risk varies substantially by biting species, wound characteristics, and host factors. Canine bite wounds typically demonstrate polymicrobial infections reflecting the dog's oral flora, with Pasteurella species (particularly P. canis), Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Capnocytophaga canimorsus, and anaerobes including Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, and Porphyromonas predominating. Several factors influence infection risk, including wound location (hand bites carrying 3-4 fold higher risk), wound type (puncture wounds posing greater risk than lacerations), host immunocompetence, and time to medical attention. Wounds sustained during aggressive interactions, particularly those occurring while animals are feeding, demonstrate particularly high inoculation burdens. Initial management centers on thorough irrigation and debridement, with high-pressure irrigation (5-8 psi) using normal saline or tap water effectively reducing bacterial inoculum. Wound closure decisions require individualized assessment, with primary closure generally avoided for high-risk wounds including punctures, hand injuries, wounds with established infection, and those presenting beyond 12 hours post-injury. Prophylactic antibiotics are recommended for higher-risk wounds, with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid representing the consensus first-line agent due to its efficacy against both aerobic and anaerobic components of the typical polymicrobial inoculum, including beta-lactamase producing organisms. Alternative regimens for penicillin-allergic patients include trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or doxycycline plus clindamycin, though these combinations provide less reliable anaerobic coverage. Tetanus prophylaxis should be administered according to standard guidelines, with rabies risk assessment conducted for all mammalian bites.
Document 3 (Title: Antibiotic Selection for Urinary Tract Infections During Pregnancy): Management of urinary tract infections during pregnancy requires careful antibiotic selection due to potential impacts on both maternal and fetal health. First-line agents should demonstrate efficacy against common uropathogens while minimizing fetal risk. Beta-lactams such as ampicillin have historically been used but rising resistance among Escherichia coli limits their empiric utility. Third-generation cephalosporins like ceftriaxone, while effective, are typically reserved for pyelonephritis or complicated infections requiring parenteral therapy. Tetracyclines, including doxycycline, are contraindicated during pregnancy due to risks of dental discoloration and potential inhibition of bone growth in the developing fetus. Nitrofurantoin represents an optimal choice for uncomplicated cystitis in pregnancy after the first trimester and before 36 weeks gestation, offering several advantages: it achieves high urinary tract concentrations with minimal systemic absorption, demonstrates efficacy against most urinary pathogens including E. coli, and has minimal impact on maternal and fetal intestinal flora. Clinical trials have consistently demonstrated its safety profile during the second and most of the third trimester, with no significant increase in congenital malformations. Nitrofurantoin should be avoided near term (>36 weeks) due to theoretical risk of hemolytic anemia in G6PD-deficient neonates.

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
Question: A 25-year-old primigravida presents to her physician for a routine prenatal visit. She is at 34 weeks gestation, as confirmed by an ultrasound examination. She has no complaints, but notes that the new shoes she bought 2 weeks ago do not fit anymore. The course of her pregnancy has been uneventful and she has been compliant with the recommended prenatal care. Her medical history is unremarkable. She has a 15-pound weight gain since the last visit 3 weeks ago. Her vital signs are as follows: blood pressure, 148/90 mm Hg; heart rate, 88/min; respiratory rate, 16/min; and temperature, 36.6℃ (97.9℉). The blood pressure on repeat assessment 4 hours later is 151/90 mm Hg. The fetal heart rate is 151/min. The physical examination is significant for 2+ pitting edema of the lower extremity. Which of the following tests o should confirm the probable condition of this patient?
Options:
A. Bilirubin assessment
B. Coagulation studies
C. Leukocyte count with differential
D. 24-hour urine protein
