Document 1 (Title: Pathophysiology of Smoking-Related Pulmonary Disorders): Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) represents a heterogeneous group of conditions characterized by persistent respiratory symptoms and airflow limitation, with cigarette smoking constituting the predominant risk factor in developed countries. The pathophysiological hallmark involves complex interactions between prolonged exposure to noxious particles and gases with host factors including genetic susceptibility and abnormal inflammatory responses. While originally conceptualized as encompassing two distinct entities—emphysema and chronic bronchitis—contemporary understanding recognizes substantial overlap with varying contributions in individual patients. The fundamental mechanism underlying airflow limitation centers on progressive obstruction of expiratory airflow resulting from multiple structural and functional alterations. Small airway disease represents the primary site of obstruction, with pathological changes including goblet cell metaplasia, mucus hypersecretion, submucosal gland hypertrophy, inflammatory cell infiltration, and airway wall fibrosis. These changes physically narrow the airway lumen while functionally increasing airway resistance. Additionally, loss of alveolar attachments due to emphysematous destruction reduces elastic recoil and radial traction on small airways, promoting airway collapse during expiration. This dynamic hyperinflation, rather than changes in static compliance or functional residual capacity, primarily accounts for exertional dyspnea. Local inflammatory mediators, though present, play secondary roles to the mechanical alterations in establishing airflow obstruction. The characteristic clinical manifestations—productive cough, progressive dyspnea, and wheezing—directly reflect these pathophysiological processes, with morning expectoration particularly suggestive of chronic bronchitis and smoking-related small airway disease.
Document 2 (Title: Current Recommendations for Reducing Sudden Infant Death Syndrome Risk): Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) remains a leading cause of death in infants between one month and one year of age, with peak incidence between two and four months. Following comprehensive epidemiological studies and the introduction of targeted preventive measures, SIDS rates have declined significantly over the past three decades. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and similar organizations worldwide have established evidence-based recommendations focusing on modifiable risk factors. The single most effective intervention involves infant sleep positioning, with clear evidence demonstrating that placing infants on their backs (supine position) on a firm sleep surface reduces SIDS risk by approximately 50%. This 'Back to Sleep' campaign has been credited with the dramatic reduction in SIDS rates since its introduction in the 1990s. Contrary to previous practices, maintaining a high ambient room temperature and excessive bundling are now recognized as potential risk factors rather than protective measures. Similarly, the use of positioning devices, wedges, or rolled blankets to maintain sleep position is discouraged due to suffocation risks. While some studies suggested that pacifier use during sleep might confer modest protective effects, avoiding pacifiers was not found to reduce SIDS risk. Current guidelines emphasize room-sharing without bed-sharing, avoiding soft bedding or objects in the sleep environment, and eliminating exposure to tobacco smoke as additional key preventive strategies.
Document 3 (Title: Viral Pathogens in Reproductive Health): Viral sexually transmitted infections represent significant public health challenges with diverse pathogenic mechanisms, clinical manifestations, and epidemiological patterns. Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) demonstrates efficient sexual transmission dynamics, with approximately 30-50% transmission risk per year in discordant monogamous relationships even during asymptomatic viral shedding periods. The virus establishes latency within sacral ganglia following primary infection, with periodic reactivation producing either symptomatic recurrences or subclinical viral shedding capable of transmission. Epidemiological studies document that genital herpes affects approximately 11-16% of adults globally, with higher prevalence in certain geographical regions and demographic groups. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission through sexual contact represents another major global health concern, with risk varying by exposure type. Receptive anal intercourse carries the highest per-act transmission probability (approximately 1-2%), while vaginal and other sexual exposures present lower but significant risks further modified by viral load, concurrent ulcerative conditions, and prevention strategies including antiretroviral therapy. Other viral pathogens demonstrate variable sexual transmission potential based on their biological characteristics and primary transmission routes. Respiratory viruses including influenza predominantly spread through respiratory secretions rather than sexual contact, with no evidence supporting significant sexual transmission. Similarly, hepatitis A virus spreads primarily through fecal-oral routes rather than sexual contact in most epidemiological contexts, though certain sexual practices can facilitate transmission in specific situations. Enteroviruses including poliovirus spread predominantly through fecal-oral routes rather than sexual contact, with no significant epidemiological evidence supporting sexual transmission as a meaningful infection route. These distinctions in transmission dynamics inform appropriate preventive strategies, diagnostic approaches, and public health interventions for different viral pathogens.

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
Question: A 66-year-old woman with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is brought to the emergency department because of fever, body aches, malaise, and a dry cough. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 30 years but quit smoking 1 year ago. She lives with her daughter and her granddaughter, who attends daycare. Her temperature is 38.1°C (101°F). Physical examination shows bilateral conjunctivitis, rhinorrhea, and erythematous tonsils without exudates. Further testing confirms infection with an enveloped orthomyxovirus. Administration of a drug with which of the following mechanisms of action is most appropriate?
Options:
A. Inhibition of nucleoside reverse transcriptase
B. Inhibition of proton translocation
C. Inhibition of neuraminidase
D. Inhibition of protease
