Document 1 (Title: Coagulation Defects in Young Women with Menorrhagia): Menorrhagia, defined as excessive menstrual bleeding lasting more than 7 days or exceeding 80 mL per cycle, affects approximately 10-30% of women of reproductive age, with a significant proportion attributable to underlying bleeding disorders. When persistent since menarche and accompanied by other mucocutaneous bleeding manifestations, inherited coagulation disorders warrant particular consideration. Von Willebrand disease (VWD), the most common inherited bleeding disorder, affects approximately 1% of the general population and accounts for up to 20% of unexplained menorrhagia cases in otherwise healthy women. VWD results from quantitative or qualitative deficiencies in von Willebrand factor (VWF), a large multimeric glycoprotein that mediates platelet adhesion to subendothelial collagen and serves as a carrier for factor VIII. This autosomal inheritance pattern leads to equal sex distribution, contrasting with the X-linked recessive inheritance of hemophilia A, which primarily affects males. Laboratory evaluation of VWD typically reveals prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) due to secondary factor VIII deficiency, while prothrombin time (PT) and platelet count remain normal. Patients typically present with mucocutaneous bleeding manifestations including easy bruising, epistaxis, gingival bleeding, and particularly menorrhagia in women. Family history often reveals similar bleeding tendencies in first-degree relatives of both sexes, contrasting with the maternal uncle pattern in hemophilia A or the prothrombotic tendencies in conditions like protein C deficiency or antiphospholipid syndrome.
Document 2 (Title: Management Algorithm for Cervical Penetrating Injuries): Penetrating neck trauma represents a unique management challenge due to the complex anatomy and potential for injury to multiple vital structures, including vascular, aerodigestive, and neurological elements. Historically, mandatory surgical exploration was advocated for all penetrating neck injuries violating the platysma. Contemporary approaches, however, have evolved toward selective management algorithms based on anatomical zone, clinical presentation, and advanced imaging. The neck is conventionally divided into three anatomical zones: Zone I (clavicles to cricoid cartilage), Zone II (cricoid cartilage to mandibular angle), and Zone III (mandibular angle to skull base). Zone I and III injuries present particular challenges due to limited surgical accessibility, while Zone II injuries permit more straightforward surgical exposure. Clinical examination remains fundamental in the initial assessment, with "hard signs" including active hemorrhage, expanding hematoma, pulsatile bleeding, shock, pulse deficit, bruit/thrill, airway compromise, massive subcutaneous emphysema, and hematemesis/hemoptysis. The presence of hard signs typically mandates immediate surgical intervention. For hemodynamically stable patients without hard signs, management has evolved from mandatory exploration toward selective non-operative approaches guided by radiographic evaluation. Computed tomographic angiography (CTA) has emerged as the preferred initial imaging modality for penetrating neck trauma without hard signs, demonstrating excellent sensitivity and specificity for detecting vascular injuries while simultaneously evaluating aerodigestive and soft tissue structures. This non-invasive modality offers significant advantages over conventional angiography, including rapid acquisition, three-dimensional reconstruction capabilities, and simultaneous assessment of non-vascular structures. CT angiography should be performed using a dedicated trauma protocol with arterial phase imaging and multiplanar reconstructions. Indications for surgical exploration following CTA include identified vascular injury requiring repair, aerodigestive tract violation, expanding hematoma, and persistent hemorrhage. Patients with normal CTA findings typically undergo a period of observation followed by reassessment prior to discharge. This selective, imaging-guided approach has significantly reduced negative exploration rates while maintaining excellent sensitivity for clinically significant injuries.
Document 3 (Title: Current Recommendations for Reducing Sudden Infant Death Syndrome Risk): Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) remains a leading cause of death in infants between one month and one year of age, with peak incidence between two and four months. Following comprehensive epidemiological studies and the introduction of targeted preventive measures, SIDS rates have declined significantly over the past three decades. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and similar organizations worldwide have established evidence-based recommendations focusing on modifiable risk factors. The single most effective intervention involves infant sleep positioning, with clear evidence demonstrating that placing infants on their backs (supine position) on a firm sleep surface reduces SIDS risk by approximately 50%. This 'Back to Sleep' campaign has been credited with the dramatic reduction in SIDS rates since its introduction in the 1990s. Contrary to previous practices, maintaining a high ambient room temperature and excessive bundling are now recognized as potential risk factors rather than protective measures. Similarly, the use of positioning devices, wedges, or rolled blankets to maintain sleep position is discouraged due to suffocation risks. While some studies suggested that pacifier use during sleep might confer modest protective effects, avoiding pacifiers was not found to reduce SIDS risk. Current guidelines emphasize room-sharing without bed-sharing, avoiding soft bedding or objects in the sleep environment, and eliminating exposure to tobacco smoke as additional key preventive strategies.

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
Question: A 23-year-old G1 at 10 weeks gestation based on her last menstrual period is brought to the emergency department by her husband due to sudden vaginal bleeding. She says that she has mild lower abdominal cramps and is feeling dizzy and weak. Her blood pressure is 100/60 mm Hg, the pulse is 100/min, and the respiration rate is 15/min. She says that she has had light spotting over the last 3 days, but today the bleeding increased markedly and she also noticed the passage of clots. She says that she has changed three pads since the morning. She has also noticed that the nausea she was experiencing over the past few days has subsided. The physician examines her and notes that the cervical os is open and blood is pooling in the vagina. Products of conception can be visualized in the os. The patient is prepared for a suction curettage. Which of the following is the most likely cause for the pregnancy loss?
Options:
A. Rh immunization
B. Antiphospholipid syndrome
C. Chromosomal abnormalities
D. Trauma
