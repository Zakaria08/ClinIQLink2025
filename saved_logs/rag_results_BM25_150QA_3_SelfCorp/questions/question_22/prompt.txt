Document 1 (Title: Neuroanatomy of Appetite Regulation): The hypothalamus serves as the principal integrative center for homeostatic regulation of feeding behavior and energy balance. Distinct hypothalamic nuclei contribute differentially to appetite control, with the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) and the ventromedial nucleus (VMN) historically characterized as the 'feeding center' and 'satiety center,' respectively. The LHA contains neurochemically diverse cell populations including neurons expressing melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) and orexin/hypocretin, which promote food intake and feeding-related behaviors. Early lesion studies demonstrated that bilateral destruction of the LHA produces profound hypophagia and weight loss, underscoring its essential role in promoting feeding behavior. Conversely, stimulation of the LHA reliably elicits feeding behavior even in satiated animals. Contemporary optogenetic and chemogenetic approaches have enabled precise temporal control of specific neuronal populations, refining our understanding of these circuits. Selective inhibition of LHA neurons using light-activated chloride channels (halorhodopsins or archaerhodopsins) to hyperpolarize cell membranes and prevent action potential generation produces dramatic cessation of feeding behavior and development of anorexia in experimental animals. When this inhibition is sustained, animals demonstrate profound reductions in food intake despite adequate metabolic resources and normal responses to other stimuli. Importantly, this effect appears specific to feeding behavior rather than representing a general disruption of motivated behaviors or arousal states. These findings align with clinical observations of hypothalamic damage, where lesions affecting the lateral hypothalamus can produce hypophagia and cachexia, while lesions of the ventromedial hypothalamus more typically result in hyperphagia and obesity.
Document 2 (Title: Malabsorption and Vitamin Deficiencies in Cystic Fibrosis): Cystic fibrosis (CF) represents an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, which encodes a chloride channel essential for epithelial fluid transport. While pulmonary manifestations typically dominate the clinical picture, pancreatic insufficiency affects approximately 85% of patients and contributes to significant nutritional complications. The pathophysiological cascade begins with defective chloride and bicarbonate secretion into the pancreatic ducts, resulting in reduced fluid volume and increased viscosity of pancreatic secretions. This leads to ductal obstruction, acinar cell damage, and ultimately fibrosis with progressive loss of exocrine function. Consequent deficiency of pancreatic enzymes, particularly lipase, causes maldigestion and malabsorption of dietary fat and fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K). Vitamin K deficiency merits particular attention due to its essential role in post-translational modification of coagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X. These vitamin K-dependent factors require gamma-carboxylation of glutamic acid residues for calcium binding and functional activity. In the absence of adequate vitamin K, undercarboxylated factors (PIVKA - Proteins Induced by Vitamin K Absence) accumulate, resulting in coagulopathy characterized by prolonged prothrombin time (PT) while activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) remains relatively normal. This pattern distinguishes vitamin K deficiency from other coagulopathies such as disseminated intravascular coagulation or liver synthetic dysfunction. Unlike vitamin A deficiency, which may manifest as corneal xerosis and night blindness, or vitamin B1 deficiency associated with Wernicke's encephalopathy, vitamin K deficiency remains clinically silent until challenged by hemostatic stress such as surgery or trauma.
Document 3 (Title: Zoonotic Viral Encephalitides: Modes of Transmission and Clinical Manifestations): Rabies virus, a neurotropic rhabdovirus of the Lyssavirus genus, represents one of the most lethal infectious diseases, with near-universal fatality once clinical symptoms develop. Transmission typically occurs through percutaneous exposure to infected saliva via animal bites, though alternative routes including mucosal exposure and aerosol inhalation have been documented in specific environmental contexts. The pathophysiological sequence begins at the inoculation site, where initial viral replication occurs within muscle tissue. Subsequently, the virus enters peripheral nerves, exploiting retrograde axonal transport to access the central nervous system. This neural progression explains the variable incubation period (typically 3-12 weeks) influenced by wound location and distance from the central nervous system. Prodromal symptoms include fever, malaise, headache, and often paresthesia or pruritus at the inoculation site. As the infection progresses to the clinical stage, patients develop the pathognomonic features of encephalitic (furious) rabies: hyperexcitability, autonomic dysfunction, hydrophobia, aerophobia, and ultimately paralysis leading to respiratory failure. Hydrophobia, the characteristic fear of water, stems from painful pharyngeal muscle spasms triggered by swallowing attempts, while hypersalivation results from dysphagia combined with increased secretion. The paralytic form presents with ascending flaccid paralysis resembling Guillain-Barré syndrome, complicating early diagnosis. Exposure risk varies significantly by geographic region and animal reservoir. Traditional sources include canids (dogs, foxes, wolves), raccoons, and skunks, though any mammal may potentially transmit the virus. Bats represent a particularly concerning vector due to their widespread distribution, potential for inapparent exposure through minor bites, and documented transmission through inhalation of aerosolized viral particles in enclosed spaces with dense bat populations. Cave exploration (spelunking), particularly in bat-inhabited caves, represents a recognized risk factor, with multiple documented cases of presumed aerosol transmission in cavers without recognized bat bites. Preventive measures focus on post-exposure prophylaxis, including wound cleansing, rabies immune globulin, and vaccination, which remains highly effective when promptly administered following exposure.

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
Question: An investigator is studying the function of the lateral nucleus of the hypothalamus in an experimental animal.

Photostimulation of the channels causes complete inhibition of action potential generation. Persistent photostimulation is most likely to result in which of the following abnormalities in these animals?
Options:
A. Hypothermia
B. Hyperthermia
C. Polydipsia
D. Anorexia
