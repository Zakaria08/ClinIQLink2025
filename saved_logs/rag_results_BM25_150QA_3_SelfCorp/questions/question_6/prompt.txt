Document 1 (Title: Uncommon Etiologies of Acute Pancreatitis): While gallstone disease and alcohol consumption account for approximately 70-80% of acute pancreatitis cases in developed countries, recognition of less common etiologies remains critical for appropriate management, particularly when traditional risk factors are absent. Scorpion envenomation represents an unusual but well-documented cause of acute pancreatitis, particularly in regions where certain scorpion species are endemic. The venom of several scorpion species, notably from the Buthidae family, contains peptide toxins that stimulate massive neurotransmitter release from both sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve terminals. The pathophysiology involves hyperstimulation of pancreatic acinar cells via cholinergic pathways, leading to premature intracellular activation of digestive enzymes and subsequent autodigestion of pancreatic tissue. This mechanism differs from medication-induced pancreatitis seen with drugs such as valproic acid, which causes direct cellular injury, or thiazides, which may induce hypercalcemia. While commonly used medications including aspirin at anti-inflammatory doses have been associated with pancreatitis in case reports, the evidence for causality remains weak in many instances. Similarly, oral contraceptives have not demonstrated conclusive links to pancreatitis outside of their potential to exacerbate hypertriglyceridemia in susceptible individuals. Hypothyroidism may indirectly contribute to pancreatitis risk through its association with hypertriglyceridemia, but does not typically serve as a direct trigger for acute pancreatic inflammation.
Document 2 (Title: Non-Classical Manifestations of Coronary Artery Disease): While classic angina typically presents as substernal chest pressure exacerbated by exertion and relieved by rest or nitroglycerin, atypical presentations of myocardial ischemia occur frequently, particularly in women, diabetic patients, and elderly individuals. These variant manifestations, sometimes termed angina equivalents, include exertional dyspnea without chest discomfort, epigastric or abdominal discomfort, and jaw or arm pain without accompanying chest sensations. Upper abdominal discomfort represents a particularly challenging variant that may be misattributed to gastrointestinal etiologies, delaying appropriate cardiac evaluation. The pathophysiological basis for these atypical presentations involves complex neurological mechanisms, with cardiac nociceptive signals sharing afferent pathways with those from other visceral structures, particularly the esophagus and upper gastrointestinal tract. Patients with significant cardiovascular risk factors reporting upper abdominal discomfort that correlates with physical exertion warrant careful evaluation for potential cardiac ischemia, even in the absence of classic chest pain. Diagnostic approaches differ markedly between suspected cardiac and gastrointestinal etiologies. While endoscopic evaluation may seem intuitive for abdominal symptoms, non-invasive cardiac assessment should take precedence when the clinical presentation suggests possible angina equivalent. Exercise stress testing, with or without imaging, provides valuable diagnostic and prognostic information by detecting inducible myocardial ischemia under controlled conditions. Functional testing such as hydrogen breath testing for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth or abdominal ultrasonography for biliary disease may be appropriate in patients where cardiac etiologies have been excluded or when symptoms and risk profile suggest primary gastrointestinal pathology.
Document 3 (Title: Operational Models for Acute Pediatric Care Delivery): Short-stay or 23-hour observation units represent an innovative care delivery model positioned between traditional outpatient management and conventional inpatient admission. These specialized units provide an intermediate level of care for patients requiring extended observation, diagnostic evaluation, or brief therapeutic interventions beyond emergency department capabilities but not necessitating full hospitalization. In pediatric settings, these units have gained increasing implementation as healthcare systems seek to optimize resource utilization while maintaining quality outcomes. Structural characteristics of pediatric short-stay units vary considerably across institutions, with diverse staffing models including dedicated hospitalist coverage, rotating faculty assignments, or extension of emergency medicine responsibilities. Physical configuration similarly ranges from designated spaces within existing departments (emergency department or inpatient ward) to standalone units. Admission criteria typically include specific diagnoses amenable to brief interventions (asthma, dehydration, cellulitis), anticipated discharge within 24 hours, hemodynamic stability, and absence of intensive monitoring requirements. Operational metrics demonstrate significant efficiency advantages compared to traditional inpatient admission. Mean length of stay typically ranges from 11-15 hours, with approximately 80-85% of patients successfully discharged within the 23-hour target. Conversion rates to inpatient status average 10-15% across reported series, with respiratory conditions and younger patient age representing the strongest predictors of conversion requirement. Cost-effectiveness analyses consistently demonstrate favorable economic outcomes, with per-patient savings of 40-60% compared to traditional inpatient admission for matched conditions. Quality indicators including readmission rates (typically 1-2% within 72 hours), adverse events, and patient/family satisfaction show equivalent or superior outcomes compared to conventional admission. Particularly compelling evidence comes from comparative studies examining matched patient cohorts treated in short-stay versus standard inpatient units. These investigations demonstrate non-inferior clinical outcomes across multiple pediatric conditions while achieving significant reductions in resource utilization, particularly nursing hours and ancillary service consumption. Implementation challenges include appropriate patient selection, care transition management, and development of condition-specific protocols that accommodate the accelerated care timeline. Successful programs emphasize standardized clinical pathways, clear admission and discharge criteria, dedicated staffing models, and robust communication mechanisms between unit personnel and primary care providers.

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
Question: A 40-year-old zookeeper presents to the emergency department complaining of severe abdominal pain that radiates to her back, and nausea. The pain started 2 days ago and slowly increased until she could not tolerate it any longer. Past medical history is significant for hypertension and hypothyroidism. Additionally, she reports that she was recently stung by one of the zoo’s smaller scorpions, but did not seek medical treatment. She takes aspirin, levothyroxine, oral contraceptive pills, and a multivitamin daily. Family history is noncontributory. Today, her blood pressure is 108/58 mm Hg, heart rate is 99/min, respiratory rate is 21/min, and temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F). On physical exam, she is a well-developed, obese female that looks unwell. Her heart has a regular rate and rhythm. Radial pulses are weak but symmetric. Her lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Her lateral left ankle is swollen, erythematous, and painful to palpate. An abdominal CT is consistent with acute pancreatitis. Which of the following is the most likely etiology for this patient’s disease?
Options:
A. Aspirin
B. Oral contraceptive pills
C. Scorpion sting
D. Hypothyroidism
