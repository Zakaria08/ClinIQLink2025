Healthy individuals infected with L. monocytogenes typically have a self-limiting gastrointestinal infection with fever and diarrhea. The Listeria family consists of 10 different species with L. monocytogenes found most consistently in humans. L. monocytogenes has 13 different serotypes based on a variety of flagellar and surface antigens. \u00a0However, there are only three serotypes (1/2a, 1/2b, 4a) that inflict disease in humans. [3] In general, the infectious dose of L. monocytogenes is large, meaning one must ingest a large number to cause clinical infection, but as growth and division can continue at refrigerator temperatures, these levels can\u00a0be reached despite typical food storage precautions. Host immune response also affects the infectious dose. Utilization of proton pump inhibitors or other stomach acid suppression modalities makes it easier for L. monocytogenes to pass through the stomach and invade enterocytes.",

Portnoy Listeria monocytogenes is a food-borne pathogen that can cause serious infections, particularly in pregnant women and immunocompromised 176 individuals. A ubiquitous saprophytic environmental bacterium, L. monocytogenes is also a facultative intracellular pathogen with a broad host range. Humans are probably accidental hosts for this microorganism. L. monocytogenes is of interest not only to clinicians but also to basic scientists as a model intracellular pathogen that is used to study basic mechanisms of microbial pathogenesis and host immunity. L. monocytogenes is a facultatively anaerobic, nonsporulating, gram-positive rod that grows over a broad temperature range, including refrigeration temperatures. This organism is motile during growth at low temperatures but much less so at 37\u00b0C. The vast majority of cases of human listerial disease can be traced to serotypes 1/2a, 1/2b, and 4.",
