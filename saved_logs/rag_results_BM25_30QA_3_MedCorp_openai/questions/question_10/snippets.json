        "title": "Myocardial Protection -- Anatomy and Physiology -- Mitochondrial Protection",
        "content": "Mitochondrial protection is crucial because mitochondria, while providing ATP to cardiomyocytes, also play a central role in activating cell death pathways. The mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) is a nonselective channel in the inner mitochondrial membrane that remains closed during ischemia-induced acidosis, offering some protection. However, if the mPTP opens, it leads to depolarization, uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation, intracellular ATP depletion, and cell death. Protecting the heart during ischemia focuses on preventing mPTP opening and promoting the activation of the mitochondrial ATP-dependent potassium channel. This invokes\u00a02 primary protective pathways: the reperfusion injury salvage kinase pathway, activated via G-protein-coupled receptors, and the survivor-activating factor enhancement pathway, which operates through tumor necrosis factor-alpha receptors.",

Besides the efficient generation of ATP from carbohydrate and fatty acid substrates, mitochondria play an important role in intermediary metabolism, serving as the source of molecules used to synthesize lipids and proteins, and they also are centrally involved in cell life and-death decisions. Mitochondria provide the enzymatic machinery for oxidative phosphorylation (and thus the relatively efficient generation of energy from glucose and fatty acid substrates).
