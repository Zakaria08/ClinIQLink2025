With your own knowledge and the help of the following document:

Document 1 (Title: Isosorbide -- Indications -- FDA Approved Indications for Isosorbide Dinitrate): Prevention or treatment of angina pectoris resulting from coronary artery disease - however, it is not recommended for use once the anginal episode has started because the onset of action is not sufficiently rapid enough to abort an acute anginal event. In the latter case, glyceryl trinitrate is preferable. Treatment of congestive heart failure. A fixed-dose combination of isosorbide dinitrate and hydralazine is approved to treat congestive heart failure in African Americans. [2]
Document 2 (Title: Biochemistry_Lippinco): .5. A 67-year-old man presented to the emergency department with a 1-week history of angina and shortness of breath. He complained that his face and extremities had taken on a blue color. His medical history included chronic stable angina treated with isosorbide dinitrate and nitroglycerin. Blood obtained for analysis was brown. Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis? A. Carboxyhemoglobinemia B. Hemoglobin SC disease C. Methemoglobinemia D. Sickle cell anemia E. β-Thalassemia
Document 3 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): Isosorbide dinitrate: Very similar to nitroglycerin, slightly longer duration of action; no transdermal form Isosorbide mononitrate: Active metabolite of the dinitrate; used orally for prophylaxis Oral and parenteral, 4–6 h duration of action • Toxicity: Asthma, atrioventricular block, acute heart failure, sedation • Interactions: Additive with all cardiac depressants Subclass, Drug Mechanism of Action Effects Clinical Applications Pharmacokinetics, Toxicities, Interactions •PropranololNonselective competitive antagonist at βadrenoceptors Decreased heart rate, cardiac output, and blood pressure•decreasesmyocardial oxygen demand Prophylaxisofangina•forother applications, see Chapters 10, 11, and 13 Atenolol, metoprolol, others: β 1-selective blockers, less risk of bronchospasm, but still significant • Amlodipine, felodipine, other dihydropyridines: Like nifedipine but slower onset and longer duration (up to 12 h or more) Prophylaxis of angina
