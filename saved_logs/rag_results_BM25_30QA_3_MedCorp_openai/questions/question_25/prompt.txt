With your own knowledge and the help of the following document:

Document 1 (Title: Pathology_Robbins): Hydronephrosis refers to dilation of the renal pelvis and calyces, with accompanying atrophy of the parenchyma, caused by obstruction to the outflow of urine. The obstruction may be sudden or insidious, and it may occur at any level of the urinary tract, from the urethra to the renal pelvis. The most common causes are categorized as follows: Congenital, such as atresia of the urethra, valve formations in either the ureter or urethra, an aberrant renal artery compressing the ureter, renal ptosis with torsion, or kinking of the ureter Foreign bodies, such as calculi or sloughed necrotic papillae Proliferative lesions, such as benign prostatic hyperplasia, carcinoma of the prostate, bladder tumors (papilloma and carcinoma), contiguous malignant disease (retroperitoneal lymphoma, and carcinoma of the cervix or uterus) Inflammatory lesions, such as prostatitis, ureteritis, urethritis, and retroperitoneal fibrosis
Document 2 (Title: Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia -- Introduction): The development of BPH is characterized by stromal and epithelial cell proliferation in the prostate transition zone, which surrounds the urethra. This leads to urethral compression and bladder outflow obstruction, which can result in clinical manifestations of LUTS, urinary retention, or infections due to incomplete bladder emptying. [5] Long-term, untreated disease can lead to the development of chronic high-pressure retention (a potentially life-threatening condition) and long-term or permanent changes to the bladder detrusor muscle.
Document 3 (Title: Urethral Strictures -- History and Physical): A key difference between benign prostatic hyperplasia and urethral stricture disease is obstructed ejaculation. [8] In addition, patients with urethral strictures do not respond to typical benign prostatic hyperplasia therapy, such as alpha-blocker medications, and the weak urinary stream is relatively constant without much variation.
