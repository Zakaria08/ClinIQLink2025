Document 1 (Title: Chromatography -- Introduction -- High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC)): This is a highly sensitive and efficient technique among different chromatography techniques, also known as high-pressure liquid chromatography. [1] Here, the solvent mixture can pass through columns containing stationary phases under high atmospheric pressure of 10 Pa to 400 Pa. This high pressure creates a high flow rate in a sample of 0.1 cm/sec to 5 cm/sec, allowing separation in a few minutes. High pressure ensures high resolution and better separation of closely related compounds; it also enables using MS as detectors, which require high flow rates. [4] The eluents are detected using UV absorption and fluorescence. The basic instrumentation setup is given in image 3.
Document 2 (Title: Biochemistry_Lippinco): the chromatography column by eluting with solutions of increasing ionic strength and pH (Fig. 2.3). The separated amino acids contained in the eluate from the column are quantitated by heating them with ninhydrin (a reagent that forms a purple compound with most amino acids, ammonia, and amines). The amount of each amino acid is determined spectrophotometrically by measuring the amount of light absorbed by the ninhydrin derivative. The analysis described above is performed using an amino acid analyzer, an automated machine whose components are depicted in Figure 2.3.
Document 3 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison): Several systems use substrates for preformed bacterial enzymes for identification within 2–3 h. These systems do not rely on bacterial growth per se to determine whether a substrate has been used. They employ a heavy inoculum in which specific bacterial enzymes are present in amounts sufficient to convert substrate to product rapidly. In addition, some systems use fluorogenic substrate/endproduct detection methods to increase sensitivity through signal amplification. Gas-Liquid Chromatography Gas-liquid chromatography often is used to detect metabolic end products of bacterial fermentation. One common application is identification of short-chain fatty acids produced by obligate anaerobes during glucose fermentation. Because the types and relative concentrations of volatile acids differ among the various genera and species that make up this group of organisms, such information serves as a metabolic fingerprint for a particular isolate.
