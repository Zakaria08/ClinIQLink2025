With your own knowledge and the help of the following document:

Document 1 (Title: Nutrition: Micronutrient Intake, Imbalances, and Interventions -- Definition/Introduction -- Water-Soluble Vitamins): Vitamin B12 (cobalamin): Vitamin B12 is a water-soluble vitamin that is a cofactor in synthesizing DNA, fatty acids, and myelin, as well as erythropoiesis and the development of the nervous system. [7] [29] Bacteria synthesize cobalamin in the gastrointestinal tract of animals, and the host later absorbs it. Because vitamin B12 is concentrated in animal tissues, it is virtually found only in animal products such as meat, dairy, and eggs. [29] [30] The RDA of vitamin B12 for adults is 2.4 mcg/d. [31]
Document 2 (Title: Biochemistry_Lippinco): Prognosis: The prognosis for recovery is excellent. Case-Related Questions: Choose the ONE best answer. Q1. Which of the following statements about vitamin C is correct? Vitamin C is: A. a competitor of iron absorption in the intestine. B. a fat-soluble vitamin with a 3-month supply typically stored in adipose tissue. C. a coenzyme in several enzymic reactions such as the hydroxylation of proline. D. required for the cross-linking of collagen. Q2. In contrast to the microcytic anemia characteristic of iron deficiency (common in older adults), a macrocytic anemia is seen with deficiencies of vitamin B12 and/or folic acid. These vitamin deficiencies are also common in older adults. Which of the following statements concerning these vitamins is correct? A. An inability to absorb B12 results in pernicious anemia. B. Both vitamins cause changes in gene expression. C. Folic acid plays a key role in energy metabolism in most cells.
Document 3 (Title: Biochemistry_Lippinco): A. Folic acid B. Folic acid and vitamin B12 C. Iron D. Vitamin C Correct answer = A. Macrocytic anemia is seen with deficiencies of folic acid, vitamin B12, or both. Vitamin B12 is utilized in only two reactions in the body: the remethylation of homocysteine (Hcy) to methionine, which also requires folic acid (as tetrahydrofolate [THF]), and the isomerization of methylmalonyl coenzyme A to succinyl coenzyme A, which does not require THF. The elevated Hcy and normal methylmalonic acid levels in the patient’s blood reflect a deficiency of folic acid as the cause of the macrocytic anemia. Iron deficiency causes microcytic anemia, as can vitamin C deficiency.
