        "content": "Signs and symptoms Signs of ethylene glycol poisoning depend upon the time after ingestion. Symptoms usually follow a three step progression, although poisoned individuals will not always develop each stage. Stage 1 (30 minutes to 12 hours) consists of neurological and gastrointestinal symptoms and looks similar to alcohol poisoning. Poisoned individuals may appear to be intoxicated, dizzy, lacking coordination of muscle movements, drooling, depressed, and have slurred speech, seizures, abnormal eye movements, headaches, and confusion. Irritation to the stomach may cause nausea and vomiting. Also seen are excessive thirst and urination. Over time, the body metabolizes ethylene glycol into other toxins. Stage 2 (12 to 36 hours) where signs of \u201calcohol\u201d poisoning appear to resolve, underlying severe internal damage is still occurring. An elevated heart rate, hyperventilation or increased breathing effort, and dehydration may start to develop, along with high blood pressure and metabolic acidosis. These symptoms are a result of accumulation of organic acids formed by the metabolism of ethylene glycol. Additionally low calcium concentrations in the blood, overactive muscle reflexes, muscle spasms, QT interval prolongation, and congestive heart failure may occur. If untreated, death most commonly occurs during this period. Stage 3 (24 to 72 hours) kidney failure is the result of ethylene glycol poisoning. In cats, this stage occurs 12\u201324 hours after consuming antifreeze; in dogs, at 36\u201372 hours after consuming antifreeze. During this stage, severe kidney failure is developing secondary to calcium oxalate crystals forming in the kidneys. Severe lethargy, coma, depression, vomiting, seizures, drooling, and inappetence may be seen. Other symptoms include acute tubular necrosis, red blood cells in the urine, excess proteins in the urine, lower back pain, decreased or absent production of urine, elevated blood concentration of potassium, and acute kidney failure. If kidney failure occurs it is typically reversible, although weeks or months of supportive care including hemodialysis may be required before kidney function returns.",

        "title": "Clinical Manifestations of Ethylene Glycol Exposure",
        "content": "Ethylene glycol intoxication presents a distinctive multi-system toxidrome requiring prompt recognition and intervention due to its potentially lethal consequences. Following ingestion, the parent compound undergoes hepatic metabolism generating multiple toxic metabolites with widespread organ impacts. Kidney injury represents a hallmark manifestation, with calcium oxalate crystalluria progressing to acute tubular necrosis and potential renal failure within 24-72 hours post-ingestion. Characteristic neurological involvement occurs in a biphasic pattern, with initial CNS depression followed by delayed cerebral edema, seizures, and potentially irreversible neurological damage mediated through metabolite neurotoxicity. Profound metabolic derangements typically develop as the intoxication progresses, including a severe high-anion-gap metabolic acidosis resulting from glycolic and oxalic acid accumulation. Concurrent electrolyte abnormalities frequently complicate management, particularly hypocalcemia secondary to calcium oxalate formation. Cardiopulmonary manifestations emerge in moderate to severe poisonings, including myocardial depression, conduction disturbances, and in severe cases, circulatory collapse requiring vasopressor support. Multiple case series document QT prolongation and tachyarrhythmias in significant exposures, sometimes necessitating advanced cardiac life support interventions. Comprehensive toxicology references describe additional rare manifestations in severe cases, though notably excluding ototoxicity or permanent hearing alterations, which remain absent from major case registries despite extensive documentation of other system effects. These collective manifestations create a recognizable pattern distinguishing ethylene glycol poisoning from other toxic alcohol ingestions, guiding appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic interventions including fomepizole administration, potential hemodialysis, and supportive care.",

        "title": "Diagnostic Approach to Preeclampsia",
        "content": "Hypertensive disorders complicate 5-10% of pregnancies and contribute significantly to maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality worldwide. Preeclampsia, a pregnancy-specific multisystem disorder characterized by hypertension and end-organ dysfunction after 20 weeks gestation, affects approximately 3-5% of pregnancies. Early detection through regular prenatal assessments remains crucial for optimizing maternal and fetal outcomes. The contemporary diagnostic criteria for preeclampsia focus on both blood pressure parameters and evidence of maternal organ dysfunction. Hypertension, defined as systolic blood pressure \u2265140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure \u226590 mmHg on two occasions at least four hours apart, represents the fundamental requirement. Proteinuria, historically considered mandatory for diagnosis, is now recognized as just one of several possible indicators of end-organ involvement. Quantification of urinary protein excretion through 24-hour urine collection remains the gold standard assessment, with significant proteinuria defined as \u2265300 mg in 24 hours or a protein/creatinine ratio \u22650.3 mg/dL in a random sample. Other laboratory evaluations, including liver function tests and coagulation studies, help assess hepatic involvement and potential HELLP syndrome (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets). Leukocytosis may occur but lacks specificity for preeclampsia. Clinical manifestations often include rapid weight gain and generalized edema, particularly facial and periorbital, distinguishing it from dependent edema commonly observed in normal pregnancy. Progressive symptoms including headache, visual disturbances, and epigastric pain suggest impending eclampsia, necessitating urgent intervention.",
