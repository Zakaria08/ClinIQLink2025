        "content": "Management of urinary tract infections during pregnancy requires careful antibiotic selection due to potential impacts on both maternal and fetal health. First-line agents should demonstrate efficacy against common uropathogens while minimizing fetal risk. Beta-lactams such as ampicillin have historically been used but rising resistance among Escherichia coli limits their empiric utility. Third-generation cephalosporins like ceftriaxone, while effective, are typically reserved for pyelonephritis or complicated infections requiring parenteral therapy. Tetracyclines, including doxycycline, are contraindicated during pregnancy due to risks of dental discoloration and potential inhibition of bone growth in the developing fetus. Nitrofurantoin represents an optimal choice for uncomplicated cystitis in pregnancy after the first trimester and before 36 weeks gestation, offering several advantages: it achieves high urinary tract concentrations with minimal systemic absorption, demonstrates efficacy against most urinary pathogens including E. coli, and has minimal impact on maternal and fetal intestinal flora. Clinical trials have consistently demonstrated its safety profile during the second and most of the third trimester, with no significant increase in congenital malformations. Nitrofurantoin should be avoided near term (>36 weeks) due to theoretical risk of hemolytic anemia in G6PD-deficient neonates.",

        "content": "Abstract: 1 Blood pressure, systemic arterial compliance, and diameter, blood flow velocity, volumic flow and impedance of the brachial artery were measured before and after intravenous administration of nitroglycerin (15 micrograms/min during 15 min) in 11 patients with sustained essential hypertension. 2 For the evaluation of the diameter of the brachial artery, a bidimensional pulsed Doppler was used, enabling the angle of the ultrasound beam relative to the flowing stream of blood to be measured with an error of less than 2%. 3 After nitroglycerin, systolic pressure significantly decreased (P less than 0.01) without significant change in diastolic and mean arterial pressures, cardiac index, stroke index and total peripheral resistance. 4 Systemic arterial compliance and brachial artery diameter significantly increased (P less than 0.001; P less than 0.01) while velocity and blood flow of the brachial artery were unchanged. 5 The pattern of the input impedance of the brachial artery was consistent with a predominant effect of nitroglycerin on the viscoelastic properties of peripheral large arteries. 6 The study provided evidence that, in hypertensive patients, nitroglycerin has a direct effect on peripheral large arteries, causing an increase in arterial diameter and compliance, thus leading to a predominant decrease in systolic pressure.",

        "title": "Pathophysiology and Clinical Manifestations of Listeriosis",
        "content": "Listeria monocytogenes represents a significant bacterial pathogen with distinctive characteristics influencing its clinical presentation and epidemiological patterns. The organism demonstrates tropism for reproductive tissues, with well-documented capacity to cross the placental barrier and infect fetal tissues, resulting in pregnancy complications including spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, and neonatal sepsis. Maternal-fetal transmission occurs in approximately 65-70% of maternal infections, representing a major concern in obstetric infectious disease. Therapeutic approaches face challenges from the organism's intracellular lifecycle, with beta-lactam antibiotics including ampicillin remaining cornerstones of therapy rather than cephalosporins like cefotaxime, which demonstrate poor activity against this pathogen despite their efficacy against many other bacterial species. Extensive virulence factor research has focused on the organism's invasion mechanisms, though notably failing to identify neurotoxin production among its pathogenic strategies, instead revealing direct invasive capabilities through specialized surface proteins enabling central nervous system penetration. Particularly significant from a food safety perspective is the organism's unusual capability for replication at standard refrigeration temperatures (4\u00b0C), enabling proliferation in properly refrigerated foods and complicating food safety protocols. The bacterium's neuroinvasive properties frequently manifest as meningoencephalitis, particularly in vulnerable populations including pregnant women, elderly individuals, and the immunocompromised. This distinctive neurological tropism results in a higher proportion of central nervous system infections compared to many other foodborne pathogens. These varied characteristics collectively establish Listeria monocytogenes as a distinctive pathogen requiring specific preventive measures, diagnostic approaches, and management strategies distinct from other foodborne bacteria.",
