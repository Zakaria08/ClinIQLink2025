        "content": "Hypothyroidism represents a common endocrine disorder with diverse manifestations reflecting thyroid hormone's fundamental role in multiple physiological processes. Laboratory evaluation reveals characteristic patterns, with reduced serum free T4 levels representing a diagnostic hallmark across various hypothyroid etiologies. The condition produces distinctive metabolic effects including significant thermoregulatory changes, with affected individuals demonstrating reduced basal metabolic rate and heat production resulting in cold intolerance and documented hypothermia in more severe cases. Energy metabolism alterations manifest clinically as progressive fatigue and characteristic weight changes despite unchanged or reduced caloric intake, with most patients experiencing 10-20 pound weight increases during disease development. Cardiovascular manifestations include bradycardia, mild hypertension, and occasionally pericardial effusions in advanced cases. Neuropsychiatric symptoms predominate in many presentations, featuring cognitive slowing, memory impairment, and depressive symptoms rather than anxiety or nervousness, which more typically characterize hyperthyroid states. Gastrointestinal motility reduction commonly produces constipation, while dermatological changes include characteristic skin dryness, hair thinning, and non-pitting edema from glycosaminoglycan accumulation. Particularly significant laboratory findings beyond thyroid function tests include dyslipidemia, with elevated total cholesterol, LDL-C, and triglycerides resulting from reduced hepatic LDL receptor expression and diminished cholesterol clearance. This consistent hypercholesterolemia represents an important metabolic consequence requiring monitoring during treatment. Comprehensive management requires addressing both the underlying thyroid dysfunction and associated metabolic derangements through appropriate hormone replacement therapy and monitoring of clinical and biochemical parameters during treatment.",

        "content": "Abstract: 1 Blood pressure, systemic arterial compliance, and diameter, blood flow velocity, volumic flow and impedance of the brachial artery were measured before and after intravenous administration of nitroglycerin (15 micrograms/min during 15 min) in 11 patients with sustained essential hypertension. 2 For the evaluation of the diameter of the brachial artery, a bidimensional pulsed Doppler was used, enabling the angle of the ultrasound beam relative to the flowing stream of blood to be measured with an error of less than 2%. 3 After nitroglycerin, systolic pressure significantly decreased (P less than 0.01) without significant change in diastolic and mean arterial pressures, cardiac index, stroke index and total peripheral resistance. 4 Systemic arterial compliance and brachial artery diameter significantly increased (P less than 0.001; P less than 0.01) while velocity and blood flow of the brachial artery were unchanged. 5 The pattern of the input impedance of the brachial artery was consistent with a predominant effect of nitroglycerin on the viscoelastic properties of peripheral large arteries. 6 The study provided evidence that, in hypertensive patients, nitroglycerin has a direct effect on peripheral large arteries, causing an increase in arterial diameter and compliance, thus leading to a predominant decrease in systolic pressure.",

        "title": "Ethylene glycol poisoning",
        "content": "Signs and symptoms Signs of ethylene glycol poisoning depend upon the time after ingestion. Symptoms usually follow a three step progression, although poisoned individuals will not always develop each stage. Stage 1 (30 minutes to 12 hours) consists of neurological and gastrointestinal symptoms and looks similar to alcohol poisoning. Poisoned individuals may appear to be intoxicated, dizzy, lacking coordination of muscle movements, drooling, depressed, and have slurred speech, seizures, abnormal eye movements, headaches, and confusion. Irritation to the stomach may cause nausea and vomiting. Also seen are excessive thirst and urination. Over time, the body metabolizes ethylene glycol into other toxins. Stage 2 (12 to 36 hours) where signs of \u201calcohol\u201d poisoning appear to resolve, underlying severe internal damage is still occurring. An elevated heart rate, hyperventilation or increased breathing effort, and dehydration may start to develop, along with high blood pressure and metabolic acidosis. These symptoms are a result of accumulation of organic acids formed by the metabolism of ethylene glycol. Additionally low calcium concentrations in the blood, overactive muscle reflexes, muscle spasms, QT interval prolongation, and congestive heart failure may occur. If untreated, death most commonly occurs during this period. Stage 3 (24 to 72 hours) kidney failure is the result of ethylene glycol poisoning. In cats, this stage occurs 12\u201324 hours after consuming antifreeze; in dogs, at 36\u201372 hours after consuming antifreeze. During this stage, severe kidney failure is developing secondary to calcium oxalate crystals forming in the kidneys. Severe lethargy, coma, depression, vomiting, seizures, drooling, and inappetence may be seen. Other symptoms include acute tubular necrosis, red blood cells in the urine, excess proteins in the urine, lower back pain, decreased or absent production of urine, elevated blood concentration of potassium, and acute kidney failure. If kidney failure occurs it is typically reversible, although weeks or months of supportive care including hemodialysis may be required before kidney function returns.",
