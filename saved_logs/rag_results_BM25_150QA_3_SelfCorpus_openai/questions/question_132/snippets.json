        "content": "Viral sexually transmitted infections represent significant public health challenges with diverse pathogenic mechanisms, clinical manifestations, and epidemiological patterns. Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) demonstrates efficient sexual transmission dynamics, with approximately 30-50% transmission risk per year in discordant monogamous relationships even during asymptomatic viral shedding periods. The virus establishes latency within sacral ganglia following primary infection, with periodic reactivation producing either symptomatic recurrences or subclinical viral shedding capable of transmission. Epidemiological studies document that genital herpes affects approximately 11-16% of adults globally, with higher prevalence in certain geographical regions and demographic groups. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission through sexual contact represents another major global health concern, with risk varying by exposure type. Receptive anal intercourse carries the highest per-act transmission probability (approximately 1-2%), while vaginal and other sexual exposures present lower but significant risks further modified by viral load, concurrent ulcerative conditions, and prevention strategies including antiretroviral therapy. Other viral pathogens demonstrate variable sexual transmission potential based on their biological characteristics and primary transmission routes. Respiratory viruses including influenza predominantly spread through respiratory secretions rather than sexual contact, with no evidence supporting significant sexual transmission. Similarly, hepatitis A virus spreads primarily through fecal-oral routes rather than sexual contact in most epidemiological contexts, though certain sexual practices can facilitate transmission in specific situations. Enteroviruses including poliovirus spread predominantly through fecal-oral routes rather than sexual contact, with no significant epidemiological evidence supporting sexual transmission as a meaningful infection route. These distinctions in transmission dynamics inform appropriate preventive strategies, diagnostic approaches, and public health interventions for different viral pathogens.",

        "title": "Enteric Viral Hepatitis: Pathogenesis and Prevention",
        "content": "Hepatitis A virus (HAV) represents a clinically significant cause of acute viral hepatitis with distinctive virological properties influencing its epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and preventive approaches. Molecular characterization identifies this pathogen as a member of the Picornaviridae family, featuring a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome enclosed within a non-enveloped icosahedral capsid approximately 27-32 nm in diameter. This structural configuration contrasts with DNA viruses causing hepatitis including hepatitis B virus, while sharing certain features with other picornaviruses such as poliovirus and rhinovirus. Transmission epidemiology demonstrates predominantly fecal-oral spread through contaminated food, water, or direct person-to-person contact, reflecting the virus's primary replication in hepatocytes with subsequent biliary excretion and high fecal viral concentrations. This transmission pattern explains the relationship between infection prevalence and sanitation infrastructure, with higher rates in regions with limited clean water access and inadequate sewage management. Clinical evolution typically follows a self-limited course without progression to chronicity, distinguishing HAV from hepatitis B and C viruses, which can establish persistent infection with potential progression to cirrhosis through chronic inflammatory mechanisms. While acute HAV infection occasionally causes severe manifestations, the virus demonstrates limited capacity for triggering the progressive fibrosis characteristic of chronic hepatotropic viral infections. Prevention strategies include both environmental interventions addressing transmission pathways and immunoprophylaxis through inactivated whole-virus vaccines providing durable protection through neutralizing antibody induction. These vaccination programs have demonstrated remarkable public health success in multiple national implementation contexts, substantially reducing HAV incidence in targeted populations through generation of long-lasting protective immunity.",

        "content": "\u201cTrichomoniasis, a prevalent sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by the protozoan Trichomonas vaginalis, has gained increased significance globally. Its relevance has grown in recent years due to its association with a heightened risk of acquiring and transmitting the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and other STIs. In addition, many publications have revealed a potential link between trichomoniasis and certain cancers. Metronidazole, a nitroimidazole compound developed over 50 years ago, remains the first choice drug for treatment. However, reports of genotoxicity and side effects underscore the necessity for new compounds to address this pressing global health concern. In this study, we synthesized ten pyrazole nitroimidazoles 1(a j) and 4 nitro 1 (hydroxyethyl) 1H imidazole 2, an analog of metronidazole, and assessed their trichomonacidal and cytotoxic effects. All compounds 1(a j) and 2 exhibited IC50 values \u2264 20 \u03bcM and \u2264 41 \u03bcM, after 24 h and 48 h, respectively. Compounds 1d (IC50 5.3 \u03bcM), 1e (IC50 4.8 \u03bcM), and 1i (IC50 5.2 \u03bcM) exhibited potencies equivalent to Metronidazole (IC50 4.9 \u03bcM), the reference drug, after 24 h. Notably, compound 1i showed high anti trichomonas activity after 24 h (IC50 5.2 \u03bcM) and 48 h (IC50 2.1 \u03bcM). Additionally, all compounds demonstrated either non cytotoxic to HeLa cells (CC50 > 100 \u03bcM) or low cytotoxicity (CC50 between 69 and 100 \u03bcM). These findings suggest that pyrazole nitroimidazole derivatives represent a promising heterocyclic system, serving as a potential lead for further optimization in trichomoniasis chemotherapy.",
