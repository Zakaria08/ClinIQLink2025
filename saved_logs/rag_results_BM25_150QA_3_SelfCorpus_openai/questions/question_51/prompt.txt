Document 1 (Title: Do mitochondria play a role in remodelling lace plant leaves during programmed cell death): Programmed cell death (PCD) is the regulated death of cells within an organism. The lace plant (Aponogeton madagascariensis) produces perforations in its leaves through PCD. The leaves of the plant consist of a latticework of longitudinal and transverse veins enclosing areoles. PCD occurs in the cells at the center of these areoles and progresses outwards, stopping approximately five cells from the vasculature. The role of mitochondria during PCD has been recognized in animals; however, it has been less studied during PCD in plants. The following paper elucidates the role of mitochondrial dynamics during developmentally regulated PCD in vivo in A. madagascariensis. A single areole within a window stage leaf (PCD is occurring) was divided into three areas based on the progression of PCD: cells that will not undergo PCD (NPCD), cells in early stages of PCD (EPCD), and cells in late stages of PCD (LPCD). Window stage leaves were stained with the mitochondrial dye MitoTracker Red CMXRos and examined. Mitochondrial dynamics were delineated into four categories (M1–M4) based on characteristics including distribution, motility, and membrane potential (ΔΨm). A TUNEL assay showed fragmented nDNA in a gradient over these mitochondrial stages. Chloroplasts and transvacuolar strands were also examined using live cell imaging. The possible importance of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) formation during PCD was indirectly examined via in vivo cyclosporine A (CsA) treatment. This treatment resulted in lace plant leaves with a significantly lower number of perforations compared to controls, and that displayed mitochondrial dynamics similar to that of non PCD cells. Results depicted mitochondrial dynamics in vivo as PCD progresses within the lace plant, and highlight the correlation of this organelle with other organelles during developmental PCD. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of mitochondria and chloroplasts moving on transvacuolar strands to form a ring structure surrounding the nucleus during developmental PCD. Also, for the first time, we have shown the feasibility for the use of CsA in a whole plant system. Overall, our findings implicate the mitochondria as playing a critical and early role in developmentally regulated PCD in the lace plant.
Document 2 (Title: Subcellular Regulation of Programmed Cell Death in Plants): Programmed cell death (PCD) represents a fundamental cellular process essential for development, differentiation, and stress responses across all multicellular organisms. In plants, PCD orchestrates numerous developmental processes including xylem formation, leaf sculpting, and reproductive organ development. The lace plant (Aponogeton madagascariensis) has emerged as a valuable model system for studying developmental PCD due to its distinctive leaf morphology, characterized by a lattice-like pattern of perforations formed through selective cell elimination. This predictable and visually accessible cell death program has facilitated detailed investigation of the subcellular mechanisms governing plant PCD. Recent advances in live-cell imaging have revealed dynamic changes in organelle function and distribution preceding visible cell death. Among these, mitochondrial alterations demonstrate particular significance in early PCD signaling and execution. Mitochondria undergo characteristic morphological and functional changes during lace plant PCD, transitioning from a reticular network in healthy cells to punctate, disconnected structures in cells undergoing death. This mitochondrial fragmentation coincides with disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential, as demonstrated through potential-dependent fluorescent probes. Notably, these changes occur prior to other hallmarks of cell death, including chloroplast degradation and plasma membrane disruption, suggesting a causative rather than consequential relationship. Functional investigations using mitochondria-targeted approaches have provided compelling evidence for mitochondrial involvement in PCD regulation. Application of mitochondrial electron transport inhibitors significantly delays or prevents perforation formation, while mitochondrial-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) appear essential for normal progression of developmental PCD. Inhibition of mitochondrial calcium uptake similarly disrupts the cell death program, indicating complex integration of calcium and ROS signaling pathways. Genetic approaches further support these findings, with altered expression of mitochondrial-associated genes including those encoding alternative oxidase and mitochondrial calcium transporters significantly modifying PCD progression and patterning. Comparative analyses across plant taxa reveal conserved mechanisms of mitochondrial involvement in PCD, with similar mitochondrial alterations observed in tracheary element differentiation and senescing petals, suggesting evolutionary conservation of core mitochondrial functions in diverse plant PCD contexts.
Document 3 (Title: Pathophysiology of Smoking-Related Pulmonary Disorders): Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) represents a heterogeneous group of conditions characterized by persistent respiratory symptoms and airflow limitation, with cigarette smoking constituting the predominant risk factor in developed countries. The pathophysiological hallmark involves complex interactions between prolonged exposure to noxious particles and gases with host factors including genetic susceptibility and abnormal inflammatory responses. While originally conceptualized as encompassing two distinct entities—emphysema and chronic bronchitis—contemporary understanding recognizes substantial overlap with varying contributions in individual patients. The fundamental mechanism underlying airflow limitation centers on progressive obstruction of expiratory airflow resulting from multiple structural and functional alterations. Small airway disease represents the primary site of obstruction, with pathological changes including goblet cell metaplasia, mucus hypersecretion, submucosal gland hypertrophy, inflammatory cell infiltration, and airway wall fibrosis. These changes physically narrow the airway lumen while functionally increasing airway resistance. Additionally, loss of alveolar attachments due to emphysematous destruction reduces elastic recoil and radial traction on small airways, promoting airway collapse during expiration. This dynamic hyperinflation, rather than changes in static compliance or functional residual capacity, primarily accounts for exertional dyspnea. Local inflammatory mediators, though present, play secondary roles to the mechanical alterations in establishing airflow obstruction. The characteristic clinical manifestations—productive cough, progressive dyspnea, and wheezing—directly reflect these pathophysiological processes, with morning expectoration particularly suggestive of chronic bronchitis and smoking-related small airway disease.
