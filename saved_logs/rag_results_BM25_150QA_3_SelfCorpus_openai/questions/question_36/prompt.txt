Document 1 (Title: Growth promoting effects of IGF-1): The first demonstration that exogenous IGF-1 stimulates growth was the administration of purified hormone to hypophysectomised rats. After the biosynthesis of IGF-1 identical to the native hormone, trials of its use in humans were begun; first in adults and then in children. Our group was the first to introduce long term administration of biosynthetic IGF-1 to children with primary IGF-1 deficiency—primary GH insensitivity or LS. The finding that daily IGF-1 administration raises serum alkaline phosphatase, which is an indicator of osteoblastic activity, and serum procollagen, in addition to IGFBP-3, led to long term treatment. Treatment of patients with LS was also initiated in other parts of the world. The difference between us and the other groups was that we used a once daily dose, whereas the others administered IGF-1 twice daily. Table 1 compares the linear growth response of children with LS treated by four different groups. It can be seen that before treatment the mean growth velocity was 3–4.7 cm/year and that this increased after IGF-1 treatment to 8.2–9.1 cm/year, followed by a lower velocity of 5.5–6.4 cm/year in the next two years. (In GH treatment the highest growth velocity registered is also in the first year of treatment.) Figure 5 illustrates the growth response to IGF-1 in eight children during the first years of treatment. Ranke and colleagues reported that two of their patients had reached the third centile (Tanner), as did the patient of Krzisnik and Battelino; however, most patients did not reach a normal final height. The reasons may be late initiation of treatment, irregular IGF-1 administration, underdosage, etc. Ranke et al conclude that long term treatment of patients with LS promoted growth and, if treatment is started at an early age, there is a considerable potential for achieving height normalisation. Because no patient in our group was treated since early infancy to final height we cannot confirm this opinion. When the growth response to GH treatment in infants with IGHD was compared with that of IGF-1 in infants with LS we found that the infants with IGHD responded faster and better than those with LS. However, the small number of patients and the differences in growth retardation between the two groups makes it difficult to reach a conclusion. Both hormones stimulated linear growth, but GH seemed more effective than IGF-1. One cause may be the greater growth deficit of the infants with LS than those with IGHD, an insufficient dose of IGF-1, or that there is a need for some GH to provide an adequate stem cell population of prechondrocytes to enable full expression of the growth promoting action of IGF-1, as postulated by Green and colleagues and Ohlson et al. All the above findings based on a few clinical studies with small groups of patients and a few experimental studies remain at present controversial. The crucial question is whether there are any, and if so, whether there are sufficient IGF-1 receptors in the “progenitor cartilage zone” of the epiphyseal cartilage to respond to endocrine and exogenous IGF-1. Using the mandibular condyle of 2 day old ICR mice, Maor et al showed that these condyles, which resemble the epiphyseal plates of the long bones, contain IGF-1 and high affinity IGF-1 receptors also in the chondroprogenitor cell layers, which enables them to respond to IGF-1 in vitro. Sims et al, using mice with GH receptor KO, showed that IGF-1 administration stimulates the growth (width) of the tibial growth plate and that IGF-1 has a GH independent effect on the growth plate. These findings are similar to those found when treating hypophysectomised rats with IGF-1. In conclusion, IGF-1 is an important growth hormone, mediating the anabolic and linear growth promoting effect of pituitary GH protein. It has a GH independent growth stimulating effect, which with respect to cartilage cells is possibly optimised by the synergistic action with GH.
Document 2 (Title: Neuromuscular Junction Disorders: Immunological Mechanisms): Myasthenia gravis (MG) represents the prototypical autoimmune disorder of neuromuscular transmission, characterized by fluctuating skeletal muscle weakness that worsens with sustained activity and improves with rest. The disease results from antibody-mediated attack against components of the postsynaptic membrane at the neuromuscular junction, predominantly targeting the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR). In approximately 85% of patients with generalized MG, serum antibodies against AChR are detectable. These antibodies, predominantly of the IgG1 and IgG3 subclasses, induce pathological changes through three principal mechanisms: complement-mediated destruction of the postsynaptic membrane, accelerated internalization and degradation of cross-linked receptors, and functional receptor blockade preventing acetylcholine binding. The cumulative effect reduces the efficiency of neuromuscular transmission, with clinical weakness manifesting when transmission fails at a critical proportion of muscle fibers. In seronegative cases, approximately 40% harbor antibodies against muscle-specific kinase (MuSK), a postsynaptic membrane protein involved in AChR clustering. Additional antigenic targets include lipoprotein receptor-related protein 4 (LRP4) and agrin. Clinical manifestations reflect the distribution of affected muscles, with ocular involvement (ptosis and diplopia) representing the initial presentation in approximately 85% of cases. Involvement of bulbar musculature produces dysarthria, dysphagia, and facial weakness, while limb-girdle muscles show characteristic fatigability with sustained or repeated activity. Distinctive features include the predilection for cranial nerve-innervated muscles, diurnal fluctuation with evening worsening, and sparing of pupillary responses. Diagnostic approaches include serological testing, electrophysiological studies demonstrating decremental response to repetitive nerve stimulation, and the edrophonium (Tensilon) test, which produces transient improvement by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase and increasing available acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction. Management strategies encompass symptomatic treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors, immunomodulation through corticosteroids and steroid-sparing agents, and more targeted approaches including thymectomy, plasmapheresis, and monoclonal antibody therapy.
Document 3 (Title: Non-Classical Manifestations of Coronary Artery Disease): While classic angina typically presents as substernal chest pressure exacerbated by exertion and relieved by rest or nitroglycerin, atypical presentations of myocardial ischemia occur frequently, particularly in women, diabetic patients, and elderly individuals. These variant manifestations, sometimes termed angina equivalents, include exertional dyspnea without chest discomfort, epigastric or abdominal discomfort, and jaw or arm pain without accompanying chest sensations. Upper abdominal discomfort represents a particularly challenging variant that may be misattributed to gastrointestinal etiologies, delaying appropriate cardiac evaluation. The pathophysiological basis for these atypical presentations involves complex neurological mechanisms, with cardiac nociceptive signals sharing afferent pathways with those from other visceral structures, particularly the esophagus and upper gastrointestinal tract. Patients with significant cardiovascular risk factors reporting upper abdominal discomfort that correlates with physical exertion warrant careful evaluation for potential cardiac ischemia, even in the absence of classic chest pain. Diagnostic approaches differ markedly between suspected cardiac and gastrointestinal etiologies. While endoscopic evaluation may seem intuitive for abdominal symptoms, non-invasive cardiac assessment should take precedence when the clinical presentation suggests possible angina equivalent. Exercise stress testing, with or without imaging, provides valuable diagnostic and prognostic information by detecting inducible myocardial ischemia under controlled conditions. Functional testing such as hydrogen breath testing for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth or abdominal ultrasonography for biliary disease may be appropriate in patients where cardiac etiologies have been excluded or when symptoms and risk profile suggest primary gastrointestinal pathology.

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
Question: A 35-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 1-month history of double vision, difficulty climbing stairs, and weakness when trying to brush her hair. She reports that these symptoms are worse after she exercises and disappear after she rests for a few hours.

The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options:
A. Myasthenia gravis
B. Polymyositis
C. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
D. Multiple sclerosis
