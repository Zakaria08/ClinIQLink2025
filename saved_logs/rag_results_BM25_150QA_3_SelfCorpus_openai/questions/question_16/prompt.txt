Document 1 (Title: Emergent Interventions for Limb-Threatening Ischemia): Acute limb ischemia represents a vascular emergency requiring rapid assessment and intervention to prevent permanent tissue damage and limb loss. The condition results from sudden interruption of arterial blood flow, most commonly due to embolism or thrombosis, with the lower extremities affected more frequently than upper extremities. Cardioembolic events account for approximately 80% of acute arterial emboli, with atrial fibrillation representing the predominant cardiac source. The clinical presentation follows the classic six Ps of ischemia: pain, pallor, pulselessness, paresthesia, paralysis, and poikilothermia (cold). Neurological manifestations—paresthesia and paralysis—represent particularly ominous signs indicating advanced ischemia with tissue compromise. Initial management focuses on preventing thrombus propagation and establishing definitive revascularization. Immediate systemic anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin constitutes the critical first therapeutic intervention, ideally administered as an intravenous bolus followed by continuous infusion titrated to therapeutic aPTT levels. This prevents thrombus propagation while diagnostic and therapeutic planning proceeds. Antiplatelet therapy with aspirin provides modest complementary benefit but should not delay anticoagulation. Revascularization options include surgical thromboembolectomy and endovascular approaches such as catheter-directed thrombolysis. Tissue plasminogen activator, while effective for cerebral ischemia within its narrow therapeutic window, carries excessive bleeding risk in peripheral arterial occlusion and requires longer infusion periods incompatible with limb salvage timeframes. The choice between surgical and endovascular approaches depends on ischemia severity, anatomic considerations, patient comorbidities, and institutional expertise, with surgery generally preferred for advanced ischemia.
Document 2 (Title: Nitroglycerin): Abstract: 1 Blood pressure, systemic arterial compliance, and diameter, blood flow velocity, volumic flow and impedance of the brachial artery were measured before and after intravenous administration of nitroglycerin (15 micrograms/min during 15 min) in 11 patients with sustained essential hypertension. 2 For the evaluation of the diameter of the brachial artery, a bidimensional pulsed Doppler was used, enabling the angle of the ultrasound beam relative to the flowing stream of blood to be measured with an error of less than 2%. 3 After nitroglycerin, systolic pressure significantly decreased (P less than 0.01) without significant change in diastolic and mean arterial pressures, cardiac index, stroke index and total peripheral resistance. 4 Systemic arterial compliance and brachial artery diameter significantly increased (P less than 0.001; P less than 0.01) while velocity and blood flow of the brachial artery were unchanged. 5 The pattern of the input impedance of the brachial artery was consistent with a predominant effect of nitroglycerin on the viscoelastic properties of peripheral large arteries. 6 The study provided evidence that, in hypertensive patients, nitroglycerin has a direct effect on peripheral large arteries, causing an increase in arterial diameter and compliance, thus leading to a predominant decrease in systolic pressure.
Document 3 (Title: Amitriptyline): Continuing Education Activity Amitriptyline is in the tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) drug classification and acts by blocking the reuptake of both serotonin and norepinephrine neurotransmitters. Amitriptyline is an FDA-approved medication to treat depression in adults. The non-FDA approved indications are anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, insomnia, chronic pain (diabetic neuropathy, fibromyalgia), irritable bowel syndrome, interstitial cystitis (bladder pain syndrome), migraine prophylaxis, postherpetic neuralgia, and sialorrhea. This activity reviews the indications, contraindications, activity, adverse events, and other key elements of amitryptiline in the clinical setting related to the essential points needed by members of an interprofessional team managing the care of patients with indications that can benefit from amitriptyline therapy. Amitriptyline is in the tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) drug classification and acts by blocking the reuptake of both serotonin and norepinephrine neurotransmitters. The three-ring central structure and a side chain are the basic structure of tricyclic antidepressants. Amitriptyline is a tertiary amine with strong binding affinities for alpha-adrenergic, histamine (H1), and muscarinic (M1) receptors.[6] Amitriptyline increases noradrenergic or serotonergic neurotransmission by blocking the norepinephrine or serotonin transporter (NET or SERT) at presynaptic terminals. Chronic treatment with amitriptyline desensitizes presynaptic autoreceptors and heteroreceptors, producing long-lasting changes in monoaminergic neurotransmission.[7] Amitryptiline is more sedating and has increased anticholinergic properties than other TCAs. As with other antidepressants, the onset of therapeutic action typically begins at approximately 2 to 4 weeks. Amitriptyline toxicity can be serious and even fatal. In treating the toxicity, the top priority is stabilizing the patient, which may require admission to the ICU for monitoring. The most important steps include - protecting the airways, breathing, and stabilizing circulation. Some patients may need tracheal intubation; if required, administer supplemental oxygen. All patients suspected of tricyclic antidepressant overdose should receive gastrointestinal decontamination. This should include large-volume gastric lavage followed by activated charcoal.[41] Seizures secondary to overdose are treatable with diazepam or lorazepam. If the patient is hypotensive, an IV bolus of isotonic crystalloid is a therapeutic option. Vasopressors are the next choice if the patient remains hypotensive despite fluid resuscitation. If QRS exceeds 100 msec, intravenous sodium bicarbonate is the appropriate intervention. Sodium bicarbonate is cardioprotective (it increases extracellular sodium concentration) and diminishes the effect of amitriptyline on the cardiac membrane, resulting in less sodium channel blockage. Alkalization favors the neutral form of amitriptyline and decreases the amount of active cyclic antidepressants.

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
Question: A 68-year-old man presents to the emergency department with leg pain. He states that the pain started suddenly while he was walking outside. The patient has a past medical history of diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and atrial fibrillation. His temperature is 99.3°F (37.4°C), blood pressure is 152/98 mmHg, pulse is 97/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. Physical exam is notable for a cold and pale left leg. The patient’s sensation is markedly diminished in the left leg when compared to the right, and his muscle strength is 1/5 in his left leg. Which of the following is the best next step in management?
Options:
A. Graded exercise and aspirin
B. Heparin drip
C. Surgical thrombectomy
D. Tissue plasminogen activator
