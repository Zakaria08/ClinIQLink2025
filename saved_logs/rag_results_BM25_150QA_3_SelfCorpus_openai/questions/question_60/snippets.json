        "content": "Traffic law reform represents a fundamental public health intervention with demonstrated capacity to reduce motor vehicle-related morbidity and mortality. Chile's comprehensive traffic safety legislation, implemented in 2005, exemplifies a multifaceted approach combining regulatory enhancement with enforcement mechanisms. This reform package included reduced blood alcohol concentration thresholds, increased penalties for infractions, expanded random breath testing authorization, and mandatory seat belt requirements. While the legislative components established necessary legal frameworks, the implementation mechanisms\u2014particularly enforcement practices\u2014critically determine real-world effectiveness. Preliminary evaluations conducted within three years of implementation revealed several noteworthy patterns regarding enforcement dynamics. Police citation activity demonstrated statistically significant increases in both frequency and geographical distribution following reform enactment. Quantitative analysis documented a 22% increase in traffic violation citations nationwide, with alcohol-related enforcement showing particularly pronounced growth (35-42% depending on violation category). Citation patterns revealed enhanced focus on newly prioritized violations, including seat belt non-compliance and speed limit infractions, suggesting strategic realignment of enforcement resources rather than merely increased overall activity. Multiple factors appear to contribute to this enforcement intensification. The legislation explicitly expanded police authority for conducting checkpoints and random breath testing, reducing procedural barriers to enforcement actions. Penalty restructuring increased both administrative efficiency and consequence severity, potentially enhancing the deterrent effect while simultaneously streamlining the citation process. Additionally, the reform package included specific resource allocation for enforcement technology, particularly automated detection systems and breath testing equipment. Importantly, temporal analysis demonstrated sustained enforcement patterns extending beyond initial implementation periods, contrasting with the transient effects often observed following similar initiatives internationally. Geographical analysis revealed reduced regional variation in enforcement intensity, suggesting more standardized nationwide implementation compared to previous enforcement patterns. These findings align with broader international research indicating that traffic law effectiveness depends substantially on enforcement characteristics\u2014particularly visibility, consistency, and perceived certainty of detection\u2014rather than merely penalty severity. The Chilean experience particularly demonstrates the potential synergistic effects between legislative frameworks that simultaneously address multifaceted risk factors, provide enforcement mechanisms, and allocate implementation resources.",

        "title": "Growth promoting effects of IGF-1",
        "content": "The first demonstration that exogenous IGF-1 stimulates growth was the administration of purified hormone to hypophysectomised rats. After the biosynthesis of IGF-1 identical to the native hormone, trials of its use in humans were begun; first in adults and then in children. Our group was the first to introduce long term administration of biosynthetic IGF-1 to children with primary IGF-1 deficiency\u2014primary GH insensitivity or LS. The finding that daily IGF-1 administration raises serum alkaline phosphatase, which is an indicator of osteoblastic activity, and serum procollagen, in addition to IGFBP-3, led to long term treatment. Treatment of patients with LS was also initiated in other parts of the world. The difference between us and the other groups was that we used a once daily dose, whereas the others administered IGF-1 twice daily. Table 1 compares the linear growth response of children with LS treated by four different groups. It can be seen that before treatment the mean growth velocity was 3\u20134.7 cm/year and that this increased after IGF-1 treatment to 8.2\u20139.1 cm/year, followed by a lower velocity of 5.5\u20136.4 cm/year in the next two years. (In GH treatment the highest growth velocity registered is also in the first year of treatment.) Figure 5 illustrates the growth response to IGF-1 in eight children during the first years of treatment. Ranke and colleagues reported that two of their patients had reached the third centile (Tanner), as did the patient of Krzisnik and Battelino; however, most patients did not reach a normal final height. The reasons may be late initiation of treatment, irregular IGF-1 administration, underdosage, etc. Ranke et al conclude that long term treatment of patients with LS promoted growth and, if treatment is started at an early age, there is a considerable potential for achieving height normalisation. Because no patient in our group was treated since early infancy to final height we cannot confirm this opinion. When the growth response to GH treatment in infants with IGHD was compared with that of IGF-1 in infants with LS we found that the infants with IGHD responded faster and better than those with LS. However, the small number of patients and the differences in growth retardation between the two groups makes it difficult to reach a conclusion. Both hormones stimulated linear growth, but GH seemed more effective than IGF-1. One cause may be the greater growth deficit of the infants with LS than those with IGHD, an insufficient dose of IGF-1, or that there is a need for some GH to provide an adequate stem cell population of prechondrocytes to enable full expression of the growth promoting action of IGF-1, as postulated by Green and colleagues and Ohlson et al. All the above findings based on a few clinical studies with small groups of patients and a few experimental studies remain at present controversial. The crucial question is whether there are any, and if so, whether there are sufficient IGF-1 receptors in the \u201cprogenitor cartilage zone\u201d of the epiphyseal cartilage to respond to endocrine and exogenous IGF-1. Using the mandibular condyle of 2 day old ICR mice, Maor et al showed that these condyles, which resemble the epiphyseal plates of the long bones, contain IGF-1 and high affinity IGF-1 receptors also in the chondroprogenitor cell layers, which enables them to respond to IGF-1 in vitro. Sims et al, using mice with GH receptor KO, showed that IGF-1 administration stimulates the growth (width) of the tibial growth plate and that IGF-1 has a GH independent effect on the growth plate. These findings are similar to those found when treating hypophysectomised rats with IGF-1. In conclusion, IGF-1 is an important growth hormone, mediating the anabolic and linear growth promoting effect of pituitary GH protein. It has a GH independent growth stimulating effect, which with respect to cartilage cells is possibly optimised by the synergistic action with GH.",
