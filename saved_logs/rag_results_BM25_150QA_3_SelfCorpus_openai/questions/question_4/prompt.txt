Document 1 (Title: Pulmonary Complications Following Orthopedic Surgery): Major orthopedic procedures, particularly those involving the lower extremities, carry significant risk for postoperative pulmonary complications that may manifest across a spectrum of severity from minor atelectasis to life-threatening respiratory failure. Among these, pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) represents one of the most serious complications, occurring in approximately 0.5-2% of patients following hip or knee arthroplasty without adequate prophylaxis. Pathophysiologically, PTE develops when thrombi from the deep venous system, most commonly the lower extremities or pelvis, dislodge and travel through the venous system to the pulmonary arterial circulation. Histopathologic examination of affected lung tissue typically reveals organized fibrinous material within pulmonary arterial vessels, often accompanied by surrounding infarction in cases of significant vascular occlusion. The classic presentation includes sudden-onset dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, and hypoxemia, though presentations may range from subtle to catastrophic depending on clot burden and cardiopulmonary reserve. Risk factors specifically relevant to orthopedic patients include immobilization, venous stasis during prolonged procedures, endothelial injury during surgical manipulation, hypercoagulability from stress response, and reduced mobility during rehabilitation. While pulmonary conditions such as primary pulmonary hypertension or passive congestion secondary to heart failure may present with similar symptoms, these entities demonstrate distinct histopathological features without the characteristic finding of intravascular thrombotic material seen in PTE.
Document 2 (Title: Post-Discharge Environmental Exposures for NICU Graduates): Infants discharged from neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) face unique vulnerability to environmental exposures due to underlying developmental and physiological characteristics. Secondhand smoke exposure represents a particular concern for this population given documented respiratory and neurodevelopmental effects. Prospective cohort studies following NICU graduates have identified concerning exposure patterns with potential health equity implications. Home environmental assessment data from four urban NICUs documented secondhand smoke exposure in 28-42% of discharged premature infants, with significant socioeconomic distribution patterns. These exposure rates demonstrate notable disparities, with exposure rates three times higher in households below poverty thresholds compared to middle-income families. Follow-up respiratory outcome tracking revealed significantly increased rehospitalization rates and medication utilization among exposed infants. Pulmonary function testing at 12-month corrected age demonstrated measurable differences between exposed and unexposed NICU graduates. The combination of prematurity-related respiratory vulnerability and secondhand smoke appears particularly detrimental based on comparative outcome analysis. Socioeconomic barriers to exposure reduction include housing constraints, extended family caregiving arrangements, and limited smoking cessation resource access. These findings align with broader health disparity research while highlighting the particular vulnerability of NICU graduates to environmental exposure inequities. The documented relationship between socioeconomic factors, exposure patterns, and health outcomes suggests important opportunities for targeted intervention programs to address these preventable health disparities.
Document 3 (Title: Parasitology and Management of Enterobius vermicularis Infection): Enterobius vermicularis (pinworm) infection represents a common helminthic condition with distinctive clinical and epidemiological characteristics requiring accurate understanding for appropriate diagnosis and management. The parasitic lifecycle demonstrates several notable features influencing clinical presentation and treatment approaches. Following ingestion of infective eggs, larval development progresses relatively rapidly through the gastrointestinal tract, with mature female worms typically beginning egg deposition within 4-6 weeks of initial infection rather than extended 3-month maturation periods documented with certain other helminthic species. Egg deposition occurs primarily through nocturnal migration of female worms to the perianal region, creating the characteristic pruritus ani that often prompts medical attention. Pulmonary involvement including Löffler's syndrome (transient pulmonary infiltrates with eosinophilia) represents a potential manifestation of certain tissue-migrating helminthic infections but characteristically does not occur during pinworm infection due to its non-migratory lifecycle confined to the intestinal lumen. Hematological assessment typically reveals minimal abnormalities, though mild eosinophilia (5-15%) may occasionally develop in some cases, particularly with heavy parasite burdens or prolonged infection. Diagnostic approaches focus on detection of characteristic eggs through adhesive tape preparations rather than direct visualization of adult worms, which remain predominantly within the intestinal lumen rather than being evacuated through the oral route, distinguishing this infection from certain other parasitic conditions where adult worm passage may occur. Treatment typically involves benzimidazole compounds including mebendazole and albendazole, with flubendazole representing an alternative therapeutic option in some geographical regions. Comprehensive management includes treating household contacts and environmental measures addressing potential fomite transmission through bedding and clothing.

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
Question: A pulmonary autopsy specimen from a 58-year-old woman who died of acute hypoxic respiratory failure was examined. She had recently undergone surgery for a fractured femur 3 months ago. Initial hospital course was uncomplicated, and she was discharged to a rehab facility in good health. Shortly after discharge home from rehab, she developed sudden shortness of breath and had cardiac arrest. Resuscitation was unsuccessful. On histological examination of lung tissue, fibrous connective tissue around the lumen of the pulmonary artery is observed. Which of the following is the most likely pathogenesis for the present findings?
Options:
A. Thromboembolism
B. Pulmonary ischemia
C. Pulmonary hypertension
D. Pulmonary passive congestion
