        "content": "Nephrotic syndrome represents a characteristic clinical constellation resulting from increased glomerular permeability to plasma proteins, with distinctive laboratory and clinical manifestations reflecting fundamental pathophysiological processes. Proteinuria exceeding 3.5g/24hr in adults constitutes the defining laboratory abnormality, representing the primary manifestation of glomerular filtration barrier dysfunction across diverse etiologies including minimal change disease, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, and membranous nephropathy. Biochemical analysis demonstrates that this protein loss predominantly comprises albumin due to its abundance and physicochemical properties, resulting in characteristic hypoalbuminemia when urinary losses exceed hepatic synthetic capacity. This albumin depletion leads to reduced plasma oncotic pressure with consequent fluid redistribution from intravascular to interstitial compartments. Total serum protein measurements invariably demonstrate reduction, typically below 60g/L, reflecting both albumin depletion and losses of other plasma proteins including immunoglobulins, clotting factors, and hormone-binding proteins. These protein alterations produce characteristic changes in serum protein electrophoresis patterns, with alpha-2 globulin fractions demonstrating increased percentage contribution to the protein profile due to relative preservation of larger proteins including alpha-2-macroglobulin compared to smaller proteins more readily filtered through the damaged glomerular barrier. Systemic blood pressure frequently demonstrates complex patterns depending on underlying etiology, with hypertension commonly accompanying nephrotic syndrome associated with primary glomerulonephritides, though not representing a fundamental component of pure nephrotic physiology itself. Renal function parameters including serum creatinine and glomerular filtration rate typically remain preserved in uncomplicated nephrotic syndrome, distinguishing it from nephritic presentations, though progressive decline may accompany specific etiologies or represent complications of prolonged nephrotic states through secondary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis development.",

        "content": "Abstract: 1 Blood pressure, systemic arterial compliance, and diameter, blood flow velocity, volumic flow and impedance of the brachial artery were measured before and after intravenous administration of nitroglycerin (15 micrograms/min during 15 min) in 11 patients with sustained essential hypertension. 2 For the evaluation of the diameter of the brachial artery, a bidimensional pulsed Doppler was used, enabling the angle of the ultrasound beam relative to the flowing stream of blood to be measured with an error of less than 2%. 3 After nitroglycerin, systolic pressure significantly decreased (P less than 0.01) without significant change in diastolic and mean arterial pressures, cardiac index, stroke index and total peripheral resistance. 4 Systemic arterial compliance and brachial artery diameter significantly increased (P less than 0.001; P less than 0.01) while velocity and blood flow of the brachial artery were unchanged. 5 The pattern of the input impedance of the brachial artery was consistent with a predominant effect of nitroglycerin on the viscoelastic properties of peripheral large arteries. 6 The study provided evidence that, in hypertensive patients, nitroglycerin has a direct effect on peripheral large arteries, causing an increase in arterial diameter and compliance, thus leading to a predominant decrease in systolic pressure.",

        "content": "Nitroglycerin is a vasodilatory drug used primarily to provide relief from anginal chest pain. Nitroglycerin has been FDA approved since 2000 and was first sold as a brand name agent. It is currently FDA approved for the acute relief of an attack or acute prophylaxis of angina pectoris secondary to coronary artery disease. Off label, non FDA approved uses include treatment for hypertensive urgency/emergency, coronary artery spasm, angina secondary to cocaine use, congestive heart failure (CHF), and chronic anal fissures. Along with hydralazine as a combination therapy, it is also indicated in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection in whom ACE inhibitors are contraindicated. Nitroglycerin is occasionally given to reduce radial spasms during coronary angiography through the radial approach. Nitroglycerin was first used in 1879 as a treatment for angina and since it has been part of management to relieve anginal chest pain.[1] Although nitroglycerin has a vasodilatory effect in both arteries and veins, the profound desired effects caused by nitroglycerin are primarily due to venodilation.[2] Venodilation causes pooling of blood within the venous system, reducing preload to the heart, which causes a decrease in cardiac work, reducing anginal symptoms secondary to demand ischemia. Arterial vasodilation will still occur and contribute to the relief of anginal symptoms.[3][4] Vasodilation of the coronary arteries will cause increased blood flow to the heart, increasing perfusion, but this effect remains minimal compared to the effects of venodilation.",
