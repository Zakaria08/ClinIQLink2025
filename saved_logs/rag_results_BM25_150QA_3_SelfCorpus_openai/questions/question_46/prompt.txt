Document 1 (Title: Urinary Obstruction and Stasis   Kidney): The pressure within the renal pelvis is normally close to zero. When this pressure increases because of obstruction or reflux, the pelvis and calyces dilate. The degree of hydronephrosis that develops depends on the duration, degree, and site of the obstruction (Figure 12–4). The higher the obstruction, the greater the effect on the kidney. If the renal pelvis is entirely intrarenal and the obstruction is at the ureteropelvic junction, all the pressure will be exerted on the parenchyma (Klein et al., 2010). If the renal pelvis is extrarenal, only part of the pressure produced by a ureteropelvic stenosis is exerted on the parenchyma; this is because the extrarenal pelvis is embedded in fat and dilates more readily, thus "decompressing" the hydronephrotic left renal pelvis. Low density mass (P) in the left renal sinus had an attenuation value similar to that of water, suggesting the correct diagnosis. Unless intravenous contrast material is used, differentiation from a peripelvic cyst may be difficult. In the earlier stages, the renal pelvic musculature undergoes compensatory hypertrophy in its effort to force urine past the obstruction. Later, however, the muscle becomes stretched and atonic and decompensated. The progression of hydronephrotic atrophy is as follows (Chevalier, 2010; Rodriguez, 2004): 1. The earliest changes in the development of hydronephrosis are seen in the calyces. The end of a normal calyx is concave because of the papilla that projects into it; with increased intrapelvic pressure, the fornices become blunt and rounded. With persistence of increased intrapelvic pressure, the papilla becomes flattened, then convex (clubbed) as a result of compression enhanced by ischemic atrophy (Figure 12–5). The parenchyma between the calyces is affected to a lesser extent. The changes in the renal parenchyma are due to (a) compression atrophy from increased intrapelvic pressure (more accentuated with intrarenal pelves) and (b) ischemic atrophy from hemodynamic changes, mainly manifested in arcuate vessels that run at the base of the pyramids parallel to the kidney outline and are more vulnerable to compression between the renal capsule and the centrally increasing intrapelvic pressure. 2. This spotty atrophy is caused by the nature of the blood supply of the kidney. The arterioles are end arteries; therefore, ischemia is most marked in the areas farthest from the interlobular arteries. As the back pressure increases, hydronephrosis progresses, with the cells nearest the main arteries exhibiting the greatest resistance. 3. This increased pressure is transmitted up the tubules. The tubules become dilated, and their cells atrophy from ischemia. It should be pointed out that a few instances of dilated renal pelves and calyces are not due to the presence of obstruction. Rarely, the renal cavities are congenitally capacious and thus simulate hydronephrosis. More commonly, hydronephrosis may occur in childhood owing to the back pressure associated with vesicoureteral reflux. If the valvular incompetence resolves (and this is common), some degree of the hydronephrotic changes may persist. These persisting changes may cause the physician to suspect the presence of obstruction, which may lead to unnecessary surgery. A radioisotope renogram to assess ureteral drainage function can be performed to determine whether organic obstruction is present. 4. Only in unilateral hydronephrosis are the advanced stages of hydronephrotic atrophy seen. Eventually, the kidney is completely destroyed and appears as a thin walled sac filled with clear fluid (water and electrolytes) or pus (Figure 12–6).
Document 2 (Title: Zoonotic Viral Encephalitides: Modes of Transmission and Clinical Manifestations): Rabies virus, a neurotropic rhabdovirus of the Lyssavirus genus, represents one of the most lethal infectious diseases, with near-universal fatality once clinical symptoms develop. Transmission typically occurs through percutaneous exposure to infected saliva via animal bites, though alternative routes including mucosal exposure and aerosol inhalation have been documented in specific environmental contexts. The pathophysiological sequence begins at the inoculation site, where initial viral replication occurs within muscle tissue. Subsequently, the virus enters peripheral nerves, exploiting retrograde axonal transport to access the central nervous system. This neural progression explains the variable incubation period (typically 3-12 weeks) influenced by wound location and distance from the central nervous system. Prodromal symptoms include fever, malaise, headache, and often paresthesia or pruritus at the inoculation site. As the infection progresses to the clinical stage, patients develop the pathognomonic features of encephalitic (furious) rabies: hyperexcitability, autonomic dysfunction, hydrophobia, aerophobia, and ultimately paralysis leading to respiratory failure. Hydrophobia, the characteristic fear of water, stems from painful pharyngeal muscle spasms triggered by swallowing attempts, while hypersalivation results from dysphagia combined with increased secretion. The paralytic form presents with ascending flaccid paralysis resembling Guillain-Barré syndrome, complicating early diagnosis. Exposure risk varies significantly by geographic region and animal reservoir. Traditional sources include canids (dogs, foxes, wolves), raccoons, and skunks, though any mammal may potentially transmit the virus. Bats represent a particularly concerning vector due to their widespread distribution, potential for inapparent exposure through minor bites, and documented transmission through inhalation of aerosolized viral particles in enclosed spaces with dense bat populations. Cave exploration (spelunking), particularly in bat-inhabited caves, represents a recognized risk factor, with multiple documented cases of presumed aerosol transmission in cavers without recognized bat bites. Preventive measures focus on post-exposure prophylaxis, including wound cleansing, rabies immune globulin, and vaccination, which remains highly effective when promptly administered following exposure.
Document 3 (Title: Ethylene glycol poisoning): Signs and symptoms Signs of ethylene glycol poisoning depend upon the time after ingestion. Symptoms usually follow a three step progression, although poisoned individuals will not always develop each stage. Stage 1 (30 minutes to 12 hours) consists of neurological and gastrointestinal symptoms and looks similar to alcohol poisoning. Poisoned individuals may appear to be intoxicated, dizzy, lacking coordination of muscle movements, drooling, depressed, and have slurred speech, seizures, abnormal eye movements, headaches, and confusion. Irritation to the stomach may cause nausea and vomiting. Also seen are excessive thirst and urination. Over time, the body metabolizes ethylene glycol into other toxins. Stage 2 (12 to 36 hours) where signs of “alcohol” poisoning appear to resolve, underlying severe internal damage is still occurring. An elevated heart rate, hyperventilation or increased breathing effort, and dehydration may start to develop, along with high blood pressure and metabolic acidosis. These symptoms are a result of accumulation of organic acids formed by the metabolism of ethylene glycol. Additionally low calcium concentrations in the blood, overactive muscle reflexes, muscle spasms, QT interval prolongation, and congestive heart failure may occur. If untreated, death most commonly occurs during this period. Stage 3 (24 to 72 hours) kidney failure is the result of ethylene glycol poisoning. In cats, this stage occurs 12–24 hours after consuming antifreeze; in dogs, at 36–72 hours after consuming antifreeze. During this stage, severe kidney failure is developing secondary to calcium oxalate crystals forming in the kidneys. Severe lethargy, coma, depression, vomiting, seizures, drooling, and inappetence may be seen. Other symptoms include acute tubular necrosis, red blood cells in the urine, excess proteins in the urine, lower back pain, decreased or absent production of urine, elevated blood concentration of potassium, and acute kidney failure. If kidney failure occurs it is typically reversible, although weeks or months of supportive care including hemodialysis may be required before kidney function returns.

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
Question: A 27-year-old man presents to the emergency room with persistent fever, nausea, and vomiting for the past 3 days. While waiting to be seen, he quickly becomes disoriented and agitated. Upon examination, he has visible signs of difficulty breathing with copious oral secretions and generalized muscle twitching. The patient’s temperature is 104°F (40°C), blood pressure is 90/64 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min with an oxygen saturation of 90% on room air. When the nurse tries to place a nasal cannula, the patient becomes fearful and combative. The patient is sedated and placed on mechanical ventilation. Which of the following is a risk factor for the patient’s most likely diagnosis?
Options:
A. Contaminated beef
B. Epiglottic cyst
C. Mosquito bite
D. Spelunking
