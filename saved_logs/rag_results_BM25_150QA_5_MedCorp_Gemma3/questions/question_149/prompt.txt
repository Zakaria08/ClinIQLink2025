With your own knowledge and the help of the following document:

Document 1 (Title: Anemia of chronic disease): Anemia of chronic disease, as it is now understood, is to at least some degree separate from the anemia seen in kidney failure in which anemia results from reduced production of erythropoietin, or the anemia caused by some drugs (like AZT, used to treat HIV infection) that have the side effect of inhibiting erythropoiesis. In other words, not all anemia seen in people with chronic disease should be diagnosed as anemia of chronic disease. On the other hand, both of these examples show the complexity of this diagnosis: HIV infection itself can produce anemia of chronic disease, and kidney failure can lead to inflammatory changes that also can produce anemia of chronic disease.
Document 2 (Title: Anemia of chronic disease): Anemia of chronic disease, also known as anemia of chronic inflammation or anemia of inflammation, is a form of anemia seen in chronic infection, chronic immune activation, and malignancy. These conditions all produce elevation of interleukin-6, which stimulates hepcidin production and release from the liver, which in turn shuts down ferroportin, a protein that controls export of iron from the gut and from iron storing cells (e.g. macrophages). As a consequence, circulating iron levels are reduced. Other mechanisms may also play a role, such as reduced erythropoiesis. Anemia of inflammation is the preferred term since not all chronic diseases are associated with this form of anemia. Classification Anemia of chronic disease is usually mild but can be severe. It is usually normocytic, but can be microcytic. The presence of both anemia of chronic disease and dietary iron deficiency results in a more severe anemia.
Document 3 (Title: Aplastic anemia): Epidemiology Aplastic anemia is a rare, noncancerous disorder in which the blood marrow is unable to adequately produce blood cells required for survival. It is estimated that the incidence of aplastic anemia is 0.7–4.1 cases per million people worldwide, with the prevalence between men and women being approximately equal. The incidence rate of aplastic anemia in Asia is 2–3 times higher than it is in the West; the incidence in the United States is 300–900 cases per year. The disease most commonly affects adults aged 15–25 and over the age of 60, but it can be observed in all age groups.
Document 4 (Title: Salmon isavirus): Epidemiology In the autumn of 1984, a new disease was observed in Atlantic salmon being farmed along the southwest coast of Norway. The disease, which was named infectious salmon anemia, spread slowly, but caused the death of up to 80% of salmon stock in some hatcheries. By June 1988 it had become sufficiently widespread and serious to require the Norwegian Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to declare it a notifiable disease. In the summer of 1996, a new disease appeared in Atlantic salmon being farmed in New Brunswick, Canada. The death rate of the fish on affected farms was very high and, following extensive scientific examination of the victims, the disease was named "hemorrhagic kidney syndrome." Although the source and distribution of this disease was not known, the results of studies by Norwegian and Canadian scientists showed conclusively that the same virus was responsible for both infectious salmon anemia and hemorrhagic kidney syndrome.
Document 5 (Title: Anemia of chronic disease): Parenteral iron is increasingly used for anemia in chronic renal disease and inflammatory bowel disease. Erythropoietin can be helpful, but this is costly and may be dangerous. Erythropoietin is advised either in conjunction with adequate iron replacement which in practice is intravenous, or when IV iron has proved ineffective. Limiting some microbes' access to iron can reduce their virulence, thereby potentially reducing the severity of infection. Blood transfusion to patients with anemia of chronic disease is associated with a higher mortality, supporting the concept.
