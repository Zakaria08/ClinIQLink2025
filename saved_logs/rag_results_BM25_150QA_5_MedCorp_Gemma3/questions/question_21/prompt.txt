Document 1 (Title: Case Study: 24-Year-Old Male Presenting With Polyarthralgias (Archived) -- Case Presentation): A 24-year-old white male with no known medical history presented to the hospital with chief complaints of 2 weeks of progressively worsening pain and swelling of his right wrist and left ankle joints. He did not report any fevers, chills, night sweats, weight loss or rash. He was employed as a fireman. He denied alcohol use disorder, smoking cigarettes, or any recreational drugs. Family history was significant for hypertension in father and ovarian cancer in the mother. His vital signs were within normal limits on presentation. On physical examination, the patient had significant swelling of multiple joints including the right wrist, right elbow, and left ankle. The joints were erythematous and tender to touch. Due to severe pain, he had limited range in the involved joints.
Document 2 (Title: [A case of early syphilis presenting general paresis-like symptoms and bilateral tonic pupils].): A 40-year-old man was admitted after 8 months of speech disturbance and locomotive ataxia. He had no seizures, lightning pains, paresthesia, visual loss, bladder disturbance or rectal incontinence. He had never been neurologically or psychiatrically ill and had no history of syphilis. When the patient was admitted, his general physical examination including blood pressure and dermatologic examination was normal. His consciousness was alert. He was found to have a deterioration of mental status such as inability to concentrate, failing memory, amnesia and circumstantiality. His pupils were anisocoric and Achilles jerks were absent. No rigidity of the neck muscles, paralysis and sensory disturbance were recognized. Romberg's sign was absent. The right pupil was 7.0 mm and the left was 6.0 mm in room illumination. The pupils were nonreactive to bright light and both did not constricted to near stimuli. 0.125% pilocarpine eyedrops produced bilateral pupillary constriction. The results indicated bilateral tonic pupils. Laboratory data revealed white cell count of 12,600/mm3 and normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 8 mm/hr. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination revealed the following: opening pressure, 140 mm of water; cell counts, 76/mm2 (mononuclear cells); total protein, 116 mg/dl; glucose, 57 mg/dl. A serum venereal disease research laboratories (VDRL) test was positive in a 1:32 titer confirmed by positive treponema pallidum hemagglutination (TPHA) test in a 1:40,960 titer and positive fluorescent treponemal antibody-absorption (FTA-ABS) test. Serum TPHA-IgM was positive in a 1:320 titer but TPHA-IgG was negative. CSF examination revealed positive TPHA test (titer of 1:2,560) and positive FTA-ABS test.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Document 3 (Title: [The protrusion of thoracic intervertebral disc-thoracic spondylosis (author's transl)].): The protrusion of cervical intervertebral discs was divided into three pathological entities by Spurling; soft disc, hard disc and spondylosis. We applied these concept to the dorsal intervertebral disc disease and treated two cases of thoracic spondylosis. Case 1. A 41-year-old male entered the hospital because of the gradual progression of weakness of both legs of two months' duration. Since ten days before admission he had not had an errection and had not been to able to walk and micturate. He also complained of paresthesia radiating down the abdomen into both legs. There were no visceral complaints. Neurological examination revealed severe weakness of both legs with bilateral impairment of deep sensations and hypalgesia up to the level of T6. Reflexes in both legs were hyperactive with sustained clonus. Plantar responses were extensor bilaterally. Though plain X-rays showed no changes, tomography revealed a calcified intervertebral spur formation at the T5-6 interspace. A myelogram showed a complete block of the contrast medium at the level of the upper part of T6. The patient underwent a complete laminectomy from T3 through T6 and extradural anterior decompression with the removal of the calcified disc at the T5-6 interspace using an air drill. Postoperatively, he demonstrated an immediate improvement in sensation and a gradual recovery in motor power. At his follow-up examination 14 months after surgery he could walk without assistance. Case 2. A 47-year-old dwarfish woman (130 cm) with a low back pain and difficulty in walking for a few years duration was admitted. A few months before admission she felt pain at her left lateral abdomen. There was weakness of both legs, greater in the left. Reflexes in her left lower extremity were hyperactive with sustained clonus. Plantar responces were flexor bilaterally. Palin X-rays showed scoliosis of thoracic spine with the top at T7 level and calcified intervertebral masses at T10-11, T11-12 and T12-L1, extending into the canal that were confirmed more clearly by tomography. Myelography by a cisternal puncture disclosed a complete block at the level of T10. The patient underwent total laminectomy of T9 through L2 and extradural anterior decompression with the removal of calcified discs. At her follow-up examination 12 months after surgery she could walk for herself with some residual neurological signs, minimal weakness in the right leg and hypesthesia up to the level of T12 in the left. We have discussed the incidental, related diagnostic and operative problems of this disease.
Document 4 (Title: [Vestibular ataxia caused by meningeal carcinomatosis].): A 74-year-old man developed progressive deafness and unsteady gait two years after gastrectomy for a gastric cancer. Neurological examination revealed an alert and intelligent Japanese male in no acute distress. The optic fundi were normal. The pupils and the extraocular muscles were normal, however, horizontal nystagmus was noted in right and left gaze. He showed marked bilateral deafness, and loss of caloric response bilaterally. No muscle atrophy nor weakness was noted. His gait was wide-based and ataxic. Tandem gait was impossible. Romberg sign was present. No cerebellar ataxia was noted in the finger-to-nose or the heel-to-knee test. No adiadochokinesis was noted. Hyperextensibility was noted in the lower extremities. Deep reflexes were normal in the upper limbs, and diminished in the lower extremities. Sensation was intact. He showed the jumbling phenomenon, and the disturbance of the righting reflex in the tilt-table examination. Neuroradiological as well as laboratory studies were unremarkable except for the high titer of CEA in the CSF. Four months after his admission, malignant tumor cells were found in the CSF. It seemed likely that he had completely lost bilateral vestibular and auditory functions caused by meningeal carcinomatosis. His disturbance of gait and station was apparently similar to cerebellar ataxic gait, however, he did not have limb ataxia. The cranial CT scans failed to show cerebellar atrophy. It was our impression that his motor disturbance was in all likelihood caused by the bilateral loss of vestibular functions, i.e., vestibular ataxia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Document 5 (Title: Traumatic extradural hematoma of the cervical spine.): An example of a traumatic extradural hematoma of the cervical spine that occurred in a 32-year-old man who suffered from chronic ankylosing spondylitis is reported. Progressive sensory and motor deficit ensued some 3 hours after the patient fell from a standing position. The patient landed on his back, striking his head on the floor. After being helped up, he was able to walk unassisted to a nearby chair, where he sat down until his left lower extremity--and shortly afterwards, the right one--became numb and weak. On admission, the patient was found to have tetraparesis that was more pronounced in the lower extremities and associated with incomplete sensation to pinprick at level T7-T10. He also had painless distention of the urinary bladder. After a few hours, the weakness in his limbs increased and his sensory level rose to C5 bilaterally. A horizontal diastatic fracture across the vertebral body of C7 was discovered on plain x-ray films of the spine, and an extradural hematoma extending dorsally from C5 to T1 was revealed by emergency magnetic resonance imaging. After an emergency decompressive cervical laminectomy and removal of the clot, the patient rapidly regained complete neurological function, except with regard to both the urinary bladder and the rectum, which remained abnormal for almost 7 weeks after the operation.

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
Question: A 69-year-old male presents to the emergency room with back pain. He has a history of personality disorder and metastatic prostate cancer and was not a candidate for surgical resection. He began chemotherapy but discontinued due to unremitting nausea. He denies any bowel or bladder incontinence. He has never had pain like this before and is demanding morphine. The nurse administers IV morphine and he feels more comfortable. Vital signs are stable. On physical examination you note tenderness to palpation along the lower spine, weakness in the bilateral lower extremities, left greater than right. Neurological examination is also notable for hyporeflexia in the knee and ankle jerks bilaterally. You conduct a rectal examination, which reveals saddle anesthesia. Regarding this patient, what is the most likely diagnosis and the appropriate next step in management?
Options:
A. The most likely diagnosis is cauda equina syndrome and steroids should be started prior to MRI
B. The most likely diagnosis is cauda equina syndrome and steroids should be started after to MRI
C. The most likely diagnosis is cauda equina syndrome and the patient should be rushed to radiation
D. The most likely diagnosis is conus medullaris syndrome and steroids should be started prior to MRI
