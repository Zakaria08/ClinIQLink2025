        "content": "Topical decongestants are decongestants applied directly to the nasal cavity. Their effectiveness by themselves in the common cold appears to have a small benefit in adults. Topical decongestants should only be used by patients for a maximum of 5\u20137 days in a row, because rebound congestion may occur in the form of rhinitis medicamentosa. When used in adults for a short period of time side effects appear to be few. Mechanism of action Topical decongestants are vasoconstrictors, and work by constricting the blood vessels within the nasal cavity. Examples Ephedrine Levomethamphetamine Naphazoline Oxymetazoline Phenylephrine Pseudoephedrine Tramazoline Xylometazoline See also Decongestant Nasal irrigation Nasal spray References",

It is available over-the-counter as a nasal spray to treat nasal congestion and nosebleeds, as eyedrops to treat eye redness due to minor irritation, and (in the United States) as a prescription topical cream to treat persistent facial redness due to rosacea in adults. Its effects begin within minutes and last for up to 6 hours. Intranasal use for longer than three days may cause congestion to recur or worsen, resulting in physical dependence.",

        "content": "Topical decongestants Decongestant nasal sprays are available over-the-counter in many countries. They work to very quickly open up nasal passages by constricting blood vessels in the lining of the nose. Prolonged use of these types of sprays can damage the delicate mucous membranes in the nose. This causes increased inflammation, an effect known as rhinitis medicamentosa or the rebound effect. Decongestant nasal sprays are advised for short-term use only, preferably 5 to 7 days at maximum. Some doctors advise to use them 3 days at maximum. A recent clinical trial has shown that a corticosteroid nasal spray may be useful in reversing this condition. Topical nasal decongestants include: Oxymetazoline Phenylephrine Xylometazoline Allergy combinations Combination use of two medications as nasal spray preparation has been frequently prescribed by doctors.

        "title": "Rhinitis medicamentosa",
        "content": "Rhinitis medicamentosa (or RM) is a condition of rebound nasal congestion suspected to be brought on by extended use of topical decongestants (e.g., oxymetazoline, phenylephrine, xylometazoline, and naphazoline nasal sprays) and certain oral medications (e.g., sympathomimetic amines and various 2-imidazolines) that constrict blood vessels in the lining of the nose, although evidence has been contradictory. Presentation The characteristic presentation of RM involves nasal congestion without rhinorrhea, postnasal drip, or sneezing following several days of decongestant use. This condition typically occurs after 5\u20137 days of use of topical decongestants. Patients often try increasing both the dose and the frequency of nasal sprays upon the onset of RM, worsening the condition. The swelling of the nasal passages caused by rebound congestion may eventually result in permanent turbinate hypertrophy, which may block nasal breathing until surgically removed.",

This may be brought on directly, as in the case of nasal piercings, or indirectly, as by long-term topical drug application, including intranasal ethylphenidate, methamphetamine, cocaine, crushed prescription pills, or decongestant nasal sprays, chronic epistaxis, excessive nose picking and as a complication of nasal surgery like septoplasty or rhinoplasty. Much less common causes for perforated nasal septums include rare granulomatous inflammatory conditions like granulomatosis with polyangiitis.
