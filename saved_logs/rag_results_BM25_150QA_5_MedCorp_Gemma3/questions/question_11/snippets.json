        "title": "[Abulia: a case of cerebral infarction in the bilateral genua of internal capsules].",
        "content": "A patient was presented with an outstanding symptom of abulia due to cerebral infarcts in the bilateral genua of internal capsules. A 53-year-old woman, generally in good health and active, had no contributory medical history except for hypertension. She was well until August 20, 1988, when she was noted to have become taciturn and absent-minded. In the morning, she got up and went to work as usual. Although she worked without trouble, she hardly talked with her colleagues. After getting home from work, she would lie down without doing any housework, and this was continued on the following day. However, she had no physical problems. She was thus admitted to a hospital on August 22. Lethargy and urinary incontinence were apparent for a few days. Thereafter she became awakeful and could take care of herself. She sat on her bed all the time, and could talk normally with her daughter. She was referred subsequently to the Department of Neurology, Hyogo Prefectural Tsukaguchi Hospital on August 30. On examination, the patient was alert, polite and cooperative with no physical abnormalities except for high blood pressure. Neurological examination indicated the patient to be attentive and well-oriented. Cranial nerves and eye movements were normal except for slight anisocoria and sluggish pupils. There were no muscle weakness, extrapyramidal signs, or cerebellar signs. Deep tendon reflexes were normal. Babinski signs and forced grasping were not noted. A neuropsychological study showed the patient not to be demented, aphasic, or apraxic.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "content": "JP is a 33-year-old woman who presents with complaints of fatigue requiring daytime naps, weight gain, cold intoler-ance, and muscle weakness for the last few months. These complaints are new since she used to always feel \u201chot,\u201d noted difficulty sleeping, and could eat anything that she wanted without gaining weight. She also would like to become preg-nant in the near future. Because of poor medication adherence to methimazole and propranolol, she received radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy, developed hypothyroidism, and was started on levothyroxine 100 mcg daily. Other medications include calcium carbonate three times daily to \u201cprotect her bones\u201d and omeprazole for \u201cheartburn.\u201d On physical exami-nation, her blood pressure is 130/89 mm Hg with a pulse of 50 bpm. Her weight is 136 lb (61.8 kg), an increase of 10 lb (4.5 kg) in the last year. Her thyroid gland is not palpable and her reflexes are delayed. Laboratory findings include a thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level of 24.9 \u03bcIU/mL",

        "content": "A Japanese woman, aged 42, was admitted because of paroxysmal attacks consisting of paresthesia of the left face, tremor in the right hand, epigastric pain and urinary incontinence. A year prior to the admission, she noticed some difficulty in writing, dysarthria and unsteadiness of walking. These symptoms had been persistent since then. At the end of March, 1991, these symptoms rapidly worsened, and she fell down frequently. She also experienced pain behind both eyes, numbness in her left fingers and toe, urinary frequency and the above-mentioned attacks. Neurological examination disclosed bilateral internuclear ophthalmoplegia and upbeating nystagmus on upward gaze, titubation in the head, scanning speech, dysmetria in all limbs, exaggerated reflexes in jaw and both legs, bilateral extensor plantar reflexes and ankle clonus. SEP showed delayed cortical response with stimulation of the median nerves bilaterally and of the right posterior tibial nerve. P40 was absent with the left posterior tibial nerve stimulation. VEP was normal. T2-weighted image of MRI showed multiple high intensity areas located around the third ventricle, crus cerebri and the right upper part of the pons. The diagnosis of multiple sclerosis was made. Each paroxysmal attack started with numbness in the left face and burning sensation in the neck. Almost simultaneously tremor in the right hand began. The surface EMG showed the rhythmic contractions in the dorsal hand muscles and wrist extensors at a frequency of 6-7 Hz, and sometimes it revealed synchronized contractions of finger flexors and the dorsal hand muscles. A few seconds later she felt painful sensation in the epigastric region, and the tremor gradually increased in its intensity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "content": "We report a patient with idiopathic hypoparathyroidism associated with unilateral calcification of the basal ganglia and contralateral choreic movements. A 66-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital because of involuntary movements of the left limbs. Two years before the present admission, she had operations for bilateral cataracts. Eight months before admission, she had an onset of severe carpal spasms and pain in both arms and legs. These symptoms improved after one month's rest in a hospital. About a month before admission, she noted progressive difficulty in using her left hand, followed by difficulty in walking due to the abnormal involuntary movement of the left lower limb. Two weeks before admission her carpal spasms appeared again, bilaterally. On admission, she was alert. The general physical examination was normal. Neurological examination revealed choreic movements in the left hand, arm, leg and neck, and grimacing of the left face. She also complained of the spasms and pain in her hands, dysarthria and shortness of the breath. Chvostek and Trousseau signs were positive. Laboratory examination revealed marked decrease in serum calcium level (2.57 mEq/ml) and increase in inorganic phosphorus level (6.40 mEq/ml). Serum level of parathyroid hormone was less than 10 pg/ml. Ellthworth-Howard test was positive, in that the infusion of parathyroid hormone (100 u) elicited a marked increment of the urinary excretions of phosphorus and cAMP. X-ray examination of the spine revealed ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament in the cervical region. CT-scans of the brain revealed calcification in the region of right globus pallidus and putamen.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
