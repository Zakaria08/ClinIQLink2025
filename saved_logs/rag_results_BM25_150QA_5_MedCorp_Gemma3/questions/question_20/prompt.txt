With your own knowledge and the help of the following document:

Document 1 (Title: Alcoholic liver disease): In people with alcoholic hepatitis, the serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ratio is greater than 2:1. AST and ALT levels are almost always less than 500. The elevated AST to ALT ratio is due to deficiency of pyridoxal phosphate, which is required in the ALT enzyme synthetic pathway. Furthermore, alcohol metabolite–induced injury of hepatic mitochondria results in AST isoenzyme release. Other laboratory findings include red blood cell macrocytosis (mean corpuscular volume > 100) and elevations of serum gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin levels. Folate level is reduced in alcoholic patients due to decreased intestinal absorption, increased bone marrow requirement for folate in the presence of alcohol, and increased urinary loss. The magnitude of leukocytosis (white blood cell depletion) reflects severity of liver injury. Histologic features include Mallory bodies, giant mitochondria, hepatocyte necrosis, and
Document 2 (Title: Glycogen storage disease type 0): Serum lactate is in reference ranges in fasting patients with glycogen-storage disease type 0. Liver function studies provide evidence of mild hepatocellular damage in patients with mild elevations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels.Plasma amino-acid analysis shows plasma alanine levels as in reference ranges during a fast. Imaging Studies Skeletal radiography may reveal osteopenia. Other Tests Evaluation of a patient with suspected glycogen-storage disease type 0 requires monitored assessment of fasting adaptation in an inpatient setting. Patients typically have hypoglycemia and ketosis, with lactate and alanine levels in the low or normal part of the reference range approximately 5–7 hours after fasting. A glucagon tolerance test may be needed if the fast fails to elicit the expected rise in plasma glucose. Lactate and alanine levels are in the reference range.
Document 3 (Title: Jaundice): Some bone and heart disorders can lead to an increase in ALP and the aminotransferases, so the first step in differentiating these from liver problems is to compare the levels of GGT, which are only elevated in liver-specific conditions. The second step is distinguishing from biliary (cholestatic) or liver causes of jaundice and altered laboratory results. ALP and GGT levels typically rise with one pattern while aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) rise in a separate pattern. If the ALP (10–45 IU/l) and GGT (18–85 IU/l) levels rise proportionately as high as the AST (12–38 IU/l) and ALT (10–45 IU/l) levels, this indicates a cholestatic problem. If the AST and ALT rise is significantly higher than the ALP and GGT rise, though, this indicates a liver problem. Finally, distinguishing between liver causes of jaundice, comparing levels of AST and ALT can prove useful. AST levels typically are higher than ALT. This remains the case in most liver disorders
Document 4 (Title: Aspartate transaminase): Aspartate transaminase (AST) or aspartate aminotransferase, also known as AspAT/ASAT/AAT or (serum) glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT, SGOT), is a pyridoxal phosphate (PLP)-dependent transaminase enzyme () that was first described by Arthur Karmen and colleagues in 1954. AST catalyzes the reversible transfer of an α-amino group between aspartate and glutamate and, as such, is an important enzyme in amino acid metabolism. AST is found in the liver, heart, skeletal muscle, kidneys, brain,red blood cells and gall bladder. Serum AST level, serum ALT (alanine transaminase) level, and their ratio (AST/ALT ratio) are commonly measured clinically as biomarkers for liver health. The tests are part of blood panels. The half-life of total AST in the circulation approximates 17 hours and, on average, 87 hours for mitochondrial AST. Aminotransferase is cleared by sinusoidal cells in the liver.
Document 5 (Title: Alanine transaminase): Alanine transaminase (ALT) is a transaminase enzyme (). It is also called alanine aminotransferase (ALT or ALAT) and was formerly called serum glutamate-pyruvate transaminase or serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) and was first characterized in the mid-1950s by Arthur Karmen and colleagues. ALT is found in plasma and in various body tissues but is most common in the liver. It catalyzes the two parts of the alanine cycle. Serum ALT level, serum AST (aspartate transaminase) level, and their ratio (AST/ALT ratio) are commonly measured clinically as biomarkers for liver health. The tests are part of blood panels. The half-life of ALT in the circulation approximates 47 hours. Aminotransferase is cleared by sinusoidal cells in the liver. Function ALT catalyzes the transfer of an amino group from L-alanine to α-ketoglutarate, the products of this reversible transamination reaction being pyruvate and L-glutamate. L-alanine + α-ketoglutarate ⇌ pyruvate + L-glutamate

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
Question: A previously healthy 36-year-old man comes to the physician for a yellow discoloration of his skin and dark-colored urine for 2 weeks. He does not drink any alcohol. Physical examination shows jaundice. Abdominal and neurologic examinations show no abnormalities. Serum studies show increased levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). A liver biopsy is performed and a photomicrograph after periodic acid-Schiff-staining is shown. Which of the following is the most likely additional finding in this patient?
Options:
A. Bullous changes of the lung bases on chest CT
B. Beading of intra- and extrahepatic bile ducts on ERCP
C. Myocardial iron deposition on cardiovascular MRI
D. Dark corneal ring on slit-lamp examination
