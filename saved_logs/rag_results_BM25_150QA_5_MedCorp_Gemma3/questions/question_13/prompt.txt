Document 1 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): Introduction to Toxicology: Occupational & Environmental Daniel T. Teitelbaum, MD* A 6-year-old girl is brought to the emergency department by her parents. She is comatose, tachypneic (25 breaths per minute), and tachycardic (150 bpm), but she appears flushed, and fingertip pulse oximetry is normal (97%) breathing room air. Questioning of her parents reveals that they are homeless and have been living in their car (a small van). The nights have been cold, and they have used a small char-coal burner to keep warm inside the vehicle. What is the most likely diagnosis? What treatment should be instituted immediately? If her mother is pregnant, what additional measures should be taken?
Document 2 (Title: [A case of two successful deliveries by a woman with Kallmann syndrome and NIDDM].): A 37 year-old female with Kallmann syndrome and NIDDM who had two successful deliveries is reported. She had experienced no menstruation until she had treatment with gestagen in her early twenties. She had withdrawal bleeding only once. At the age of 25, she consulted her family doctor, complaining of amenorrhea. Estrogen progesterone cyclic therapy caused withdrawal bleeding, and clomiphene citrate failed to induce apparent ovulation. In January 1978, 150 IU of hMG was administered daily for 9 days, and then 3000 IU of hCG daily for the following 2 days. This therapy induced pregnancy, which failed spontaneously on June 4th. A year later, in January 1979, 150 IU of hMG was again administered daily for 7 days followed by 6000 IU of hCG for 3 days. This therapy again induced pregnancy. On September 27th, 1979, she delivered a girl vaginally, weighing 3830 g. After this delivery, she experienced no menstruation. In June 1985, she consulted her family doctor again, and she was diagnosed as being pregnant. Since her fasting blood glucose was 145 mg/dl, she was admitted to Kosei Hospital to control her blood glucose. On October 15th, she delivered a girl weighing 2600 g. On June 13th, 1989, she was referred to Kosei Hospital by her family doctor to achieve an accurate control of her blood glucose. During this admission, she was diagnosed as having Kallmann syndrome because of congenital anosmia and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism without any abnormal morphological changes. Vitamin B1 infusion test was negative.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Document 3 (Title: Princess Marie Bonaparte, Edgar Allan Poe, and psychobiography.): Princess Marie Bonaparte was a colorful yet mysterious member of Freud's inner circle of psychoanalysis. In analysis with Freud beginning in 1925 (she was then 45 years old), she became a lay analyst and writer of many papers and books. Her most ambitious task was a 700-page psychobiography of Edgar Allan Poe that was first published in French in 1933. She was fascinated by Poe's gothic stories--with the return to life of dead persons and the eerie, unexpected turns of events. Her fascination with Poe can be traced to the similarity of their early traumatic life experiences. Bonaparte had lost her mother a month after her birth. Poe's father deserted the family when Edgar was two years old, and his mother died of tuberculosis when he was three. Poe's stories helped him to accommodate to these early traumatic losses. Bonaparte vicariously shared in Poe's loss and the fantasies of the return of the deceased parent in his stories. She was sensitive and empathetic to Poe's inner world because her inner world was similar. The result of this psychological fit between Poe and Bonaparte was her psychobiography, The Life and Works of Edgar Allan Poe. It was a milestone in psychobiography but limited in its psychological scope by its strong emphasis on early childhood trauma. Nevertheless it proved Bonaparte a bona fide creative psychoanalyst and not a dilettante propped up by her friendship with Freud.
Document 4 (Title: Parental use of "positive contact" in child-rearing: its relationship to child behavior patterns and other variables.): In an investigation of child-rearing styles maternal use of "positive contact" was measured by asking the mother how often she played with the child, praised the child, and the like, and combining the responses into a score. Home observations on a sample of families revealed that mothers scoring above the mean used fewer communications in the form of directives and "unmodified power" and more communication in the form of praise and social conversation than mothers scoring below the mean. The mother's use of positive contact was related to her educational level, the birth order of the child and number of children in the family, the father's use of positive contact, and to a friendly outgoing pattern of child behavior. There was no relation to the mother's use of physical punishment, her protectiveness, her tendency to comply with the child's demands, or her child-rearing ideology and other attitudes. Child care workers are in a strategic position to educate parents about the importance of this kind of contact, especially with later-born children in large families.
Document 5 (Title: [A case of arteriovenous malformation in a neonate].): Although arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is considered a congenital disease, few cases of AVM are manifested clinically in the neonatal period. In this paper a neonatal case of AVM manifested as intracranial hemorrhage is reported. A newborn female infant 12 days after birth, was admitted to a hospital with the chief complaint of sudden onset of vomiting and fever. Neurological examination revealed left hemiparesis with bulging of the anterior fontanel. CT examination demonstrated a large mass lesion with hemorrhage in the right parietal lobe. The lesion was enhanced with contrast medium. Consent for surgery was not able to be obtained from her family, so she was treated conservatively. A gradually enlarging cyst surrounding the mass appeared in follow-up CT examination. Her left hemiparesis and bulging of the anterior fontanel remained unchanged, and a rather good general health condition was maintained. Consent for surgery was finally obtained from her parents and the patient was transferred to our hospital three months after the onset of the symptoms. Cerebral angiogram showed AVM with a big aneurysmal sac. The feeder arteries of the AVM arose from the right middle cerebral artery and the anterior cerebral artery. The drainers poured into the superior sagittal sinus. AVM was removed totally by right parietal craniotomy on the 24th January, 1989. Postoperatively, her left hemiparesis started to improve gradually. Her general condition was also good, and she showed no neurological deficits at the age of 8 months.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
Question: A 9-month-old female is brought to the emergency department after experiencing a seizure. She was born at home and was normal at birth according to her parents. Since then, they have noticed that she does not appear to be achieving developmental milestones as quickly as her siblings, and often appears lethargic. Physical exam reveals microcephaly, very light pigmentation (as compared to her family), and a "musty" body odor. The varied manifestations of this disease can most likely be attributed to which of the following genetic principles?
Options:
A. Anticipation
B. Multiple gene mutations
C. Pleiotropy
D. Variable expressivity
