Document 1 (Title: Diloxanide): Diloxanide came into medical use in 1956. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is not commercially available in much of the developed world as of 2012. Medical uses Diloxanide furoate works only in the digestive tract and is a lumenal amebicide. It is considered second line treatment for infection with amoebas when no symptoms are present but the person is passing cysts, in places where infections are not common. Paromomycin is considered the first line treatment for these cases. For people who are symptomatic, it is used after treatment with ambecides that can penetrate tissue, like metronidazole or tinidazole. Diloxanide is considered second-line, while paromomycin is considered first line for this use as well.
Document 2 (Title: Staphylococcus aureus): Medical implant infections S. aureus is often found in biofilms formed on medical devices implanted in the body or on human tissue. It is commonly found with another pathogen, Candida albicans, forming multispecies biofilms. The latter is suspected to help S. aureus penetrate human tissue. A higher mortality is linked with multispecies biofilms. S. aureus biofilm is the predominant cause of orthopedic implant-related infections, but is also found on cardiac implants, vascular grafts, various catheters, and cosmetic surgical implants. After implantation, the surface of these devices becomes coated with host proteins, which provide a rich surface for bacterial attachment and biofilm formation. Once the device becomes infected, it must by completely removed, since S. aureus biofilm cannot be destroyed by antibiotic treatments.
Document 3 (Title: Solidago): Goldenrod species are used as a food source by the larvae of many Lepidoptera species. The invading larva may induce the plant to form a bulbous tissue mass called a gall around it, upon which the larva then feeds. Various parasitoid wasps find these galls and lay eggs in the larvae, penetrating the bulb with their ovipositors. Woodpeckers are known to peck open the galls and eat the insects in the center. Cultivated species Cultivated goldenrods include S. bicolor, S. caesia, S. canadensis, S. cutleri, S. riddellii, S. rigida, S. shortii, and S. virgaurea. A number of cultivars have been selected, including several of hybrid origin. A putative hybrid with aster, known as ×Solidaster is less unruly, with pale yellow flowers, equally suitable for dried arrangements. Molecular and other evidence points to ×Solidaster (at least the cultivar 'Lemore') being a hybrid of Solidago ptarmicoides and Solidago canadensis, the former now in Solidago, but likely the "aster" in question.
Document 4 (Title: Selective androgen receptor modulator): Examples Clinical testing Enobosarm (Ostarine, MK-2866, GTx-024, S-22) – One of the most popular SARMs, affects both muscle and bone, intended mainly for osteoporosis but also general treatment for andropause and reversing muscle sarcopenia in the elderly and for cachexia in cancer patients. BMS-564,929 – Mainly affects muscle growth, intended as general treatment for symptoms of andropause LGD-4033 (Ligandrol) – pharmacological profile similar to that of enobosarm. Pre-clinical AC-262,356 LGD-2226 – Affects both muscle and bone LGD-3303 S-40503 – Selective for bone tissue, particularly low virilization, intended for osteoporosis and may be suitable for use in women. S-23 – Under development as a male hormonal contraceptive RAD140 (Testolone)
Document 5 (Title: Diloxanide): Diloxanide is a medication used to treat amoeba infections. In places where infections are not common, it is a second line treatment after paromomycin when a person has no symptoms. For people who are symptomatic, it is used after treatment with metronidazole or tinidazole. It is taken by mouth. Diloxanide generally has mild side effects. Side effects may include flatulence, vomiting, and itchiness. During pregnancy it is recommended that it be taken after the first trimester. It is a luminal amebicide meaning that it only works on infections within the intestines. Diloxanide came into medical use in 1956. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is not commercially available in much of the developed world as of 2012.
