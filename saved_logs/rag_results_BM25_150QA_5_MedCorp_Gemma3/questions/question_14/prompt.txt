Document 1 (Title: [A case of facial nerve neurinoma originated from the cerebellopontine angle portion].): Facial nerve neurinomas are relatively rare and most of them appear at the vertical portion of the facial nerve. Facial nerve neurinoma originated from the cerebellopontine (c-p) angle portion is less frequently reported. A 51-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital complaining of severe headache and nausea. She had had dizziness and unsteady gait for the previous two weeks. She did not complain of hearing disturbance, but otological examination revealed sensorineural deafness. She had no facial palsy. Skull x-ray showed no erosion of the internal auditory canal. Plain CT-scan revealed a large, unenhanced, low-density mass in the right c-p angle cistern. At the time of the operation, this tumor originated from the right facial nerve. Histological diagnosis of this tumor was schwannoma. After the operation, right facial nerve palsy appeared but hardness of hearing was no worse than previously. This tumor seemed to be facial nerve neurinoma in the c-p angle cistern. To the present, 121 facial nerve neurinomas have been reported in the previous literature. Facial nerve neurinomas in the c-p angle cistern, however, have only been reported in 5 cases. The most frequent symptom of facial nerve neurinoma in the temporal bone is facial nerve palsy, but that of facial nerve neurinoma in the c-p angle cistern is hearing loss, as in an acoustic neurinoma. Preoperative diagnosis of facial neurinoma in the c-p angle cistern using neurological symptoms alone is difficult. Furthermore, differential diagnosis from acoustic neurinoma in the c-p angle cistern using only skull x-rays and CT-scanning is also difficult.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Document 2 (Title: [Acute hearing loss in the contralateral ear after acoustic tumor removal].): Two patients suffered from acute hearing loss of the contralateral side after acoustic tumor surgery were reported. The first patient was a 42-year-old-male. He had had a right progressive hearing loss over two years and CT scan revealed a mass of 20mm in diameter in the right cerebellopontine angle. The patient noticed the contralateral hearing loss on next morning after the total removal of tumor by translabyrinthine approach. However he had no complaint of vertigo or facial palsy. An audiogram of the contralateral side just after the onset showed flat type audiogram of sensorineural hearing loss with positive recruitment. With steroid therapy for two weeks, hearing and ABR findings improved and returned to nearly normal. The second case was a 47-year-old male. The patient had chronic renal failure treated by hemodialysis. His hearing loss in the right ear had gradually decreased over two years and an acoustic tumor of 2.5cm in diameter was demonstrated by CT scan. The tumor was removed by translabyrinthine approach. Nine day after the operation, he noted total deafness in contralateral ear and vertigo. He was given steroid hormone and his hearing improved up to 68 dB. Four cases have been reported in the literature. The mechanisms of acute sensorineural hearing loss observed in these cases were discussed. The cause remained unknown, however there were some hypothesis such as the compression to the opposite brainstem, peripheral nerve or feeding vessels by tumor or brain edema after operation, and local vasospasms might be also the cause of hearing impairment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Document 3 (Title: Metastasis from an unknown primary presenting as a tumor in the internal auditory meatus.): A 40-year-old male presented with a 2-month history of sudden hearing loss and tinnitus in his left ear. Mild vertigo was present initially but disappeared spontaneously without treatment. Facial nerve paralysis and retroauricular pain appeared 3 months after the onset of hearing loss on the same side. Computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a 1-cm mass in the left internal auditory canal. Translabyrinthine removal of tumor revealed metastatic adenocarcinoma. The patient died 3 months postoperatively from multiple metastatic deposits. A primary tumor was never found. The course of illness in this patient differs significantly from the typical course of other conditions involving the internal auditory canal. A metastatic work-up should be considered for patients with a similar history before a craniotomy is performed.
Document 4 (Title: [Wallenberg's syndrome in a case of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease].): A 45-year-old Japanese man, who had had bilateral visual disturbance due to Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease 17 years before entry, was admitted to this hospital because of headache, vertigo and vomiting. On examination at entry, no abnormalities except for poliosis, patches of vitiligo on his left shin, sunset glow fundus, and positional nystagmus with Frenzel glasses were found. Laboratory data other than leukocytosis and elevated level of gamma-GTP were normal and the results of brain CT scan were within normal limits. On the following day, diplopia was developed and the neurological symptoms including loss of bilateral visual acuity, Horner's syndrome on the right side, right facial palsy, bilateral sensorineural hearing disturbance, palsy of the soft palate on the right side with swallowing difficulty, and dissociated sensory disturbance on the right face and the upper and lower extremities on the left side appeared with a few days. He couldn't get up. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was clear and had pleocytosis with normal sugar content. The protein, immunoglobulin G and myelin basic protein (MBP) were elevated but the tests for oligoclonal band and antiviral antibodies were negative. Brain CT scan showed low density areas in right cerebellar hemisphere and in left putamen without abnormality with contrast material and evoked potentials were normal. Prednisolone was prescribed and his symptoms were subsided but his gait remained ataxic. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 4 months later showed an atrophy of the lower half of bilateral cerebellar hemisphere supplied by posterior inferior cerebellar artery, suggesting cerebellar infarction, and high intensity areas on T2 image in bilateral cerebral white matters, basal ganglia, and left cerebral peduncle.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Document 5 (Title: [Acoustic neurinoma presenting with repeated intratumoral hemorrhage. Case report].): A case of acoustic neurinoma with multiple intratumoral hemorrhages is reported. A 56-year-old male noted sudden hearing reduction in his left ear in October of 1985. The diagnosis of a local physician was sudden deafness. About 10 months later, he had two episodes of severe headache without nausea or vomiting. The patient was hospitalized in October of 1986. Neurological examination cerebellar ataxia. cerebellar ataxia. Plain and enhanced computed tomography revealed only an unremarkable low-density area at the left cerebellopontine angle. In contrast, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) clearly demonstrated a large (3 x 4 x 5 cm), multicystic tumor in the site. On exposure of the tumor at surgery, most of the cysts were found to be filled with a dark red or xanthochromic fluid. The tumor was completely removed following numerous cyst punctures to decrease its volume. There was no evidence of subarachnoid hemorrhage. Histological examination showed a typical acoustic neurinoma. The cyst wall contained numerous telangiectasia-like lesions. The initial symptom of this patient was sudden hearing loss, which is an atypical manifestation of acoustic neurinoma. The massive intratumoral hemorrhage was thought to be caused by telangiectatic lesions in the cyst wall. MRI clearly demonstrated the hemorrhagic cysts within the tumor, especially in the posterior fossa.

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
Question: A 23-year-old man comes to the physician for evaluation of decreased hearing, dizziness, and ringing in his right ear for the past 6 months. Physical examination shows multiple soft, yellow plaques and papules on his arms, chest, and back. There is sensorineural hearing loss and weakness of facial muscles bilaterally. His gait is unsteady. An MRI of the brain shows a 3-cm mass near the right internal auditory meatus and a 2-cm mass at the left cerebellopontine angle. The abnormal cells in these masses are most likely derived from which of the following embryological structures?
Options:
A. Neural tube
B. Surface ectoderm
C. Neural crest
D. Notochord
