Document 1 (Title: Sacrococcygeal teratoma): Management of fetal SCTs Management of most fetal SCTs involves watchful waiting prior to any treatment. An often used decision tree is as follows: Perform detailed ultrasound exam including fetal echocardiogram and Doppler flow analysis If fetal high output failure, placentomegaly, or hydrops If fetus not mature, perform pregnancy termination or fetal intervention Else fetus mature, perform emergency Cesarean section Else no emergent problems, perform serial non-stress tests and ultrasound biophysical profiles and plan delivery, as follows If emergent problems develop, return to top of decision tree Else if SCT over 5–10 cm or polyhydramnios, perform early (37 weeks gestation) elective Cesarean section Else SCT small and no complications, permit term spontaneous vaginal delivery
Document 2 (Title: Pregnancy test): Ultrasound Obstetric ultrasonography may also be used to detect and diagnose pregnancy. It is very common to have a positive at home urine pregnancy test before an ultrasound. Both abdominal and vaginal ultrasound may be used, but vaginal ultrasound allows for earlier visualization of the pregnancy. With obstetric ultrasonography the gestational sac (intrauterine fluid collection) can be visualized at 4.5 to 5 weeks gestation, the yolk sac at 5 to 6 weeks gestation, and fetal pole at 5.5 to 6 weeks gestation. Ultrasound is used to diagnose multiple gestation. Accuracy A systematic review published in 1998 showed that home pregnancy test kits, when used by experienced technicians, are almost as accurate as professional laboratory testing (97.4%). When used by consumers, however, the accuracy fell to 75%: the review authors noted that many users misunderstood or failed to follow the instructions included in the kits.
Document 3 (Title: Pregnancy after Fontan repair of tricuspid atresia.): We have described a patient who had a cyanotic congenital heart disease (type Ib tricuspid atresia), with initial palliation accomplished in childhood via a Glenn procedure. In 1985, she had a Fontan repair with the Bjork modification; 3 years later she achieved her first pregnancy at age 27. Maternal Doppler echocardiography in early pregnancy showed good flow through the constructed conduit, with normal left ventricular size and function. Fetal echocardiography at 22 weeks' gestation via two-dimensional, M-mode, pulsed Doppler, and color flow mapping revealed no evidence of fetal cardiac disease. At 25 weeks' gestation recalcitrant preterm labor developed, and the infant was delivered spontaneously. Labor, delivery, and puerperium were uncomplicated, and the newborn (though too premature to survive) was of appropriate weight for gestational age, without evidence of congenital heart disease or other anomalies. We believe this is the first report of pregnancy and spontaneous delivery in a patient who has had Fontan repair of a congenital heart defect.
Document 4 (Title: Cesarean section does not improve outcome in gastroschisis.): Elective cesarean section (CS) following prenatal diagnosis of gastroschisis has been advocated to decrease morbidity and mortality. To examine this hypothesis, we reviewed the records of 28 consecutive patients with gastroschisis treated between 1975 and 1987. Fourteen infants were delivered vaginally (V) and fourteen by CS, of which seven were elective, five were for fetal distress, and two were for breech presentation. Prenatal diagnosis was made in nine infants in the CS group and none in the vaginal group. The two groups were comparable in gestational age (V = 37.6 weeks, CS = 35.8 weeks, P = .05), birth weight (V = 2,508 g, CS = 2,444 g, P = NS), and five-minute Apgar score (V = 7.8, CS = 6.8, P = NS). Outcome was similar as measured by hospital mortality (V = 0/14, CS = 1/14, P = NS), complications (V = 4/14, CS = 5/14, P = NS), days to enteral feeding (V = 14, CS = 19, P = NS), and days in the hospital (V = 27, CS = 34, P = NS). The only complication related to mode of delivery was preventable; an infant delivered vaginally had avulsion of a short segment of mesentery requiring bowel resection. Infants born by CS were slightly more likely to have primary closure (5/14) than babies delivered vaginally (3/14, P = NS), but this may reflect independent trends in the last 5 years. Elective CS following prenatal diagnosis in seven patients did not improve outcome; primary closure was achieved in only one infant, and three had a complication. Since these data show no significant difference in morbidity and mortality between vaginal and CS delivery, we suggest that CS should not be recommended simply because a prenatal diagnosis of gastroschisis is made.
Document 5 (Title: Caesarean section): A planned caesarean (or elective/scheduled caesarean), arranged ahead of time, is most commonly arranged for medical indications which have developed before or during the pregnancy, and ideally after 39 weeks of gestation. In the UK, this is classified as a 'grade 4' section (delivery timed to suit the mother or hospital staff) or as a 'grade 3' section (no maternal or fetal compromise but early delivery needed). Emergency caesarean sections are performed in pregnancies in which a vaginal delivery was planned initially, but an indication for caesarean delivery has since developed. In the UK they are further classified as grade 2 (delivery required within 90 minutes of the decision but no immediate threat to the life of the woman or the fetus) or grade 1 (delivery required within 30 minutes of the decision: immediate threat to the life of the mother or the baby or both.)

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
Question: A 3900-g (8.6-lb) male infant is delivered at 39 weeks' gestation via spontaneous vaginal delivery. Pregnancy and delivery were uncomplicated but a prenatal ultrasound at 20 weeks showed a defect in the pleuroperitoneal membrane. Further evaluation of this patient is most likely to show which of the following findings?
Options:
A. Gastric fundus in the thorax
B. Pancreatic ring around the duodenum
C. Hypertrophy of the gastric pylorus
D. Large bowel in the inguinal canal
