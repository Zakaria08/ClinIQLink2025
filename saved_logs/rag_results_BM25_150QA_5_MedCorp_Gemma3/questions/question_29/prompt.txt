Document 1 (Title: [MRI findings of brain-stem tuberculoma in a case of tuberculous meningitis].): A 54-year-old woman developed headache and slight fever. When she consulted a physician, she could not move either of her eyes to the right. Cranial CT scan revealed no significant findings. Lumbar puncture was performed and CSF examination showed the cell count of 10,304/mm3, glucose level of 10 mg/dl, and total protein value of 270 mg/dl. Her symptoms and laboratory findings suggested meningitis and she was admitted to our hospital. Neurological examination revealed bilateral dilated pupils with sluggish light reflex, right gaze palsy, and hypesthesia of the left side of her face. A diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis was established by a positive test for acid-fast bacillus in CSF, and anti-tuberculous therapy was started at once. One month after the onset of symptoms, her main complaints were double vision and cerebellar ataxia. Both CT and MRI revealed a right brain-stem lesion. Pre-contrast CT could not clearly visualize the lesion but with contrast medium a homogeneously-enhanced circular lesion was shown. MRI on T2WI demonstrated the right brain-stem lesion to have a central bright core with hypointense periphery, which in turn was surrounded by hyperintensity. The lesion appeared isointense with cerebral white matter and the "central bright core" area was demonstrated to be slightly hypointense on T1WI. On post-contrast T1WI (with Gd-DTPA), the lesion showed strong homogeneous enhancement. The CT and MRI findings indicated a brain-stem tuberculoma, which was regarded as the cause of the ocular movement paralysis and cerebellar ataxia. As the clinical symptoms gradually resolved with anti-tuberculous treatment, the MRI appearance of the lesion also improved.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Document 2 (Title: [Recurrent episodic unilateral mydriasis with pleocytosis in the cerebrospinal fluid--a case report].): A 24-year-old female was admitted to our hospital on Aug. 20 in 1986 because of blurred vision and right pupillary dilatation. She had sometimes noticed headache later than 1976, and blurred vision without headache several times a year later than 1983. She had been told her right pupil dilated when she had complained of blurred vision. Neurological examination revealed abnormal findings as follows; diminished sense of smell in the right side, anisocoria (R 8 mm, L 5 mm), bilateral hippus, hypesthesioalgesia in her right face, left trunk and left arm. The pupils were round and contracted promptly to light. Accommodation reflex and ciliospinal reflexes were normal. Neither blepharoptosis nor external ocular muscle paresis were observed. Deep tendon reflexes were normal. Planter responses were flexor. There was no meningeal irritative sign. No abnormal findings were obtained in blood and urine, chest X-p, brain enhanced CT scan, EEG, and cerebral angiography except for slight degree of anemia. Serum TPHA was negative. However, the cell count of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was 18/mm3 (Ly 100%) and decreased to 9/mm3 (Ly 100%) in nine days. Protein content and glucose level of CSF were normal. Pupils were not constricted by 0.125% pilocarpine instillation. Loss of smell and sensory disturbance disappeared within three days and her pupils became isocoric by five days after admission. The patients of episodic unilateral mydriasis without apparent cause had relatively same clinical features as "unilateral springing pupil" proposed by Hallett et al. (1970). Except for mydriasis, they had no abnormal findings of neurological and laboratory examinations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Document 3 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): Introduction to Autonomic Pharmacology Bertram G. Katzung, MD, PhD A 56-year-old woman is brought to the university eye center with a complaint of “loss of vision.” Because of visual impair-ment, she has lost her driver’s license and has fallen several times in her home. Examination reveals that her eyelids close involuntarily with a frequency and duration sufficient to pre-vent her from seeing her surroundings for more than brief moments at a time. When she holds her eyelids open with her fingers, she can see normally. She has no other muscle dysfunction. A diagnosis of blepharospasm is made. Using a fine needle, several injections of botulinum toxin type A are made in the orbicularis oculi muscle of each eyelid. After observation in the waiting area, she is sent home. Two days later, she reports by telephone that her vision has improved dramatically. How did botulinum toxin improve her vision? How long can her vision be expected to remain normal after this single treatment?
Document 4 (Title: Rehabilitation of an adult with disabilities due to congenital sensory neuropathy.): A 37-year-old woman presented with congenital loss of all peripheral sensory modalities, sparing only her face, paraspinal area and proximal limbs. She was otherwise neurologically normal. Her sensory neuropathy was complicated by autoamputation of phalanges, pathologic fractures, failed total hip replacement, burns, pressure ulcers, and a painless peptic ulcer. An unusual cluster of functional deficits occurred when she was unable to substitute vision for peripheral sensibility. In the sudden darkness of a power failure she would fall to the floor; we advised the installation of battery-operated safety lights activated by a drop in line voltage. Voice-activated lights overcame difficulty in finding light switches in darkened rooms. She was unable to drive at night until she had a light placed under the dashboard of her car so she could see the foot pedals. She was unable to wash her hair, as shampoo irritation made her close her eyes and lose balance; swimming goggles and a nonfogging mirror permitted independence in her hair care. The solution of these functional difficulties provides a fresh perspective on the rehabilitation of patients with severe sensory impairments, especially with a cooperative family.
Document 5 (Title: Hypertensive retinopathy caused by a rare ovarian tumor: case report and photo essay.): A 38-year-old female presented for an optometric exam complaining that her "vision had occasionally gone blank while reading during the past 2 months". Although visual acuity was 20/20 in both eyes, hypertensive retinopathy was present in both eyes. Blood pressure was measured to be 210/142. After inadequate response to initial treatment, her family physician referred her to an internist. Ultimately, a four pound Sertoli-Leydig ovarian tumor was found to be causing malignant hypertension. Removal of the tumor and medical treatment of the hypertension cleared the hypertensive retinopathy within 4 months. Prompt optometric care led to the timely discovery of this tumor, and probably prolonged this woman's life. This case illustrates the valuable role optometric care can have in the management of hypertension from any cause. Coordination with the primary physician as to the status of the hypertensive retinopathy is an integral part of the total management. Retinal photographs at presentation and at various stages of treatment dramatically show how the level of fundus pathology is related to the level of hypertension.

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
Question: A 63-year-old woman presents to her primary-care doctor for a 2-month history of vision changes, specifically citing the gradual onset of double vision. Her double vision is present all the time and does not get better or worse throughout the day. She has also noticed that she has a hard time keeping her right eye open, and her right eyelid looks 'droopy' in the mirror. Physical exam findings during primary gaze are shown in the photo. Her right pupil is 6 mm and poorly reactive to light. The rest of her neurologic exam is unremarkable. Laboratory studies show an Hb A1c of 5.0%. Which of the following is the next best test for this patient?
Options:
A. Direct fundoscopy
B. Intraocular pressures
C. MR angiography of the head
D. Temporal artery biopsy
