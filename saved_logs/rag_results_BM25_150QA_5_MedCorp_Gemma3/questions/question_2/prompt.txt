Document 1 (Title: [Asphyxia protracted after shaking trauma].): A case of "shaken baby syndrome" (SBS) is reported. A 3 1/2 months old female baby has been found by his mother death in bed. The circumstances predicted a case of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), but the father, a disc-jockey, who had to look for the baby, had left a notice: "Gitti--i didn't want it, I don't know what had happened, I'm sorry!". The corpse of the baby had no external signs of violence. At the medicolegal examination we found small subarachnoidal and subdural hemorrhage from ruptured bridge veins and signs of prolonged asphyxia. Few hours later the father could be arrested. He told that he had shaken the baby, because she didn't stop crying. The infant lost conscious and he layed him down to the bed with his face below. Then he looked TV for at least a few minutes. After insufficient reanimation he had left the house. The court found the man to be guilty of fatal infant child abuse and convicted him to detention of 8 months. The main signs of SBS are discussed (subarachnoidal and subdural hemorrhage, intraretinal and periretinal hemorrhages, brain edema). Especially in the german speaking Europe many medical examiners are not familiar with this form of infant child abuse.
Document 2 (Title: [Aortoesophageal fistula by swallowed foreign body--a case report and review of the literature].): A case of aortoesophageal fistula is presented. The etiology, symptoms, and diagnosis of aortoesophageal fistula are reviewed. A 22-year-old nurse died just after massive hematemesis. The autopsy finding revealed massive hemorrhage in the gastrointestinal tract and conspicuously pale organs. The fistula between the thoracic descending aorta and esophagus was observed. Microscopically, acute inflammation and blood clots containing bacterial colonies were found around the fistulous tract. Eight days before her death, she felt retrosternal sticking pain just after eating a baked slice of sea bream. She consulted a family doctor, but no foreign body was discovered in the esophagus with radiography and endoscopy. As a dull pain and slight fever did not disappear and continued intermittently, she often consulted the doctor. A small hemorrhage in the left wall of esophagus was noted 2 days before her death with endoscopy. She was hospitalized over the night and the next day she was discharged and get home. After taking a nap, she felt a syncopal attack in the afternoon. A tarry stool was noticed in the evening. The next morning, she died suddenly in exsanguination. The clinical feature of aortoesophageal fistula is uniform and has been described as Chiari's triad, i.e., the chest pain, the symptom-free interval and the signal hemorrhage, and the fatal hemorrhage. The present case showed the typical symptom of aortoesophageal fistula by swallowed foreign body, though fish bone or any foreign body was not discovered with examinations. Approximately 100 cases of aortoesophageal fistula by esophageal foreign body have been reported since 1818. The present case is the second one reported in Japan as caused by foreign body.
Document 3 (Title: Anna Nicole Smith): On April 10, 2007, a Bahamian judge ruled that DNA tests had established Birkhead as the father of Smith's daughter. Birkhead subsequently applied for an amended birth certificate listing him as the father, which paved the way for him to obtain a passport for the baby to leave with him for the U.S. Stern did not contest the DNA results or the ruling and Birkhead returned to the United States with the baby. Smith's mother, Virgie Arthur, appealed the ruling, but her appeal was denied and she was ordered to pay costs. Death of son Smith's 20-year-old son, Daniel Wayne Smith, died on September 10, 2006, in his mother's hospital room while visiting her and her baby. An autopsy found that he died from a combination of drugs, including methadone and antidepressants. A Bahamian jury determined Daniel died from an accidental drug overdose and recommended no criminal charges.
Document 4 (Title: Pattern of night waking and crying of Korean infants from 3 months to 2 years old and its relation with various factors.): Night waking and crying are very common in infancy and can cause problems for parents and families. This study surveyed 218 healthy Korean infants from 3 months to 2 years old to determine their night waking and crying patterns. On average, 83% awoke and 28% cried more than once per night. Ninety-eight percent of the babies slept with a member of the family. Infants with transitional objects or nighttime habits (e.g., finger sucking, touching and/or playing with mother's or own hair, touching a part of mother's or own body) cried more frequently. In terms of the maternal response toward the crying babies, most of the mothers used traditional methods, such as patting/holding, feeding, changing diapers. Only one mother ignored the crying baby, and none used medication, delayed response, or white noise. Sixteen percent of the mothers indicated that their babies' crying constituted a problem for them.
Document 5 (Title: Nannie Doss): Grandchildren Melvina gave birth to Robert Lee Haynes in 1943. Another baby followed two years later but died soon afterward. Exhausted from labor and groggy from ether, Melvina thought she saw her visiting mother stick a hatpin into the baby's head. When she asked her husband and sister for clarification, they said Nannie had told them the baby was dead—and they noticed that she was holding a pin. The doctors, however, couldn't give a positive explanation. The grieving parents drifted apart and Melvina started dating a soldier. Nannie disapproved of him, and while Melvina was visiting her father after a particularly nasty fight with her mother, her son Robert died mysteriously under Nannie's care on July 7, 1945. The death was diagnosed as asphyxia from unknown causes, and two months later Nannie collected the $500 life insurance she had taken out on Robert.
