Document 1 (Title: [Motor neuron disease with Parkinson's disease--case report].): The patient was a 64-year-old woman who showed muscle weakness and tremor of upper extremities and gait disturbance at the age of 62 years. The symptoms progressed and she was admitted to our hospital. Neurological examination revealed muscle weakness, muscle atrophy and fasciculation bilaterally in the upper extremities. The deep tendon reflexes were reduced in the upper extremities and increased in the lower extremities, but Babinski's sign was not present. There was mild hand tremor at rest (right greater than left). Muscle rigidity was also evident. Her gait was small-stepped and her trunk was bent forward. She showed hypomimia, but no dementia was detected. She died of respiratory failure 7 months after admission. The duration of the illness was about 2 years. At autopsy, macroscopic examination showed depigmentation of the substantia nigra and locus ceruleus, and atrophy of the anterior roots of the spinal cord. Microscopic examination revealed a few senile plaques in the temporal cortex. In the substantia nigra, the number of melanin-containing cells was decreased in its central parts. A few Lewy bodies were found in some of the remaining neurons, and melanin pigment migrated into the parenchyma. In the locus ceruleus and dorsal motor nucleus of vagus, abundant Lewy bodies and mild astrocytosis were seen. A few Lewy bodies were also seen in the nucleus raphe, nucleus basalis of Meynert and hypothalamic nuclei. Severe neuronal loss of the anterior horn cells was observed in the cervical segment, and to a lesser degree, in the lumbo-sacral segments. segments.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Document 2 (Title: [A case of generalized komuragaeri disease (Satoyoshi disease) treated with glucocorticoid].): Generalized komuragaeri disease (Satoyoshi disease) is a rare disorder of unknown etiology, characterized by painful muscle spasms, alopecia, diarrhea and various endocrine disorders. We administered glucocorticoid to a girl with this disease, resulting in a marked improvement of all clinical features. The patient was a 15-year-old girl. Since the age of 13 years, she had had intermittent painful muscle spasms, which affected any skeletal muscles 5 to 15 times a day at exercise and at rest and lasted for a few minutes. At the age of 14 years, she had idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura which responded to the glucocorticoid treatment. Amenorrhea and orthostatic hypotension developed at the age of 14 years. Then the loss of body and head hair was noticed and progressed slowly. She had not experienced severe diarrhea. On admission, her physical and neurological examinations showed no abnormalities except for the thin hair and frequent muscle spasms. Laboratory examinations showed elevated levels of serum creatine kinase and aldolase, positive antinuclear antibody of speckled pattern and a mild disturbance in carbohydrate absorption. Endocrinological tests suggested the dysfunction of hypothalamus as a cause of amenorrhea. Electromyogram showed large action potentials on spasms. She was treated with glucocorticoid, 2 mg/kg on alternate days. The muscle spasms decreased gradually in frequency and duration in 1 month of treatment, and disappeared in 4 months. The growth of her hair was noticed and orthostatic hypotension disappeared in 4 months. Menstruation became regular in 7 months. The muscle spasms worsened when the dosage of glucocorticoid was reduced, and they improved on the increased dosage. She was free of symptoms at 6 months after the successful diminution of glucocorticoid. The etiology of this disease has not been revealed. The association of autoimmune disorders and the responsiveness of all clinical features to glucocorticoid suggest that an autoimmune process is involved in the pathogenesis of generalized komuragaeri disease.
Document 3 (Title: [Reducing body myopathy--a case report].): A 2-year-old girl with reducing body myopathy was reported. She had no family history of neuromuscular disease. She developed normally with no delay in milestones during infancy. She had no muscle weakness or hypotonia up to 2 years of age when she received mumps vaccination. Three days after the injection, she was first noticed to have limb muscle weakness. The muscle weakness progressed rapidly with increasing difficulty in gait and raising the upper arms, particularly the left. Four months later, she had difficulty in keeping her head up and could no longer climb the stairs. On physical examination, she had proximal dominant generalized muscle weakness, with a preferential neck muscle involvement. She walked waddlingly and stood up with Gowers' maneuver. Facial and ocular muscles were intact. No dysarthria, dysphagia or respiratory difficulty was noted. EMG showed myopathic pattern. Serum creatine kinase level was moderately elevated to 739 IU/l. In the biopsied left biceps muscle, there was marked variation in fiber size, but no apparent necrotic or regenerating fibers. The most striking feature was the presence of numerous eosinophilic inclusions which reduced nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) and were, therefore, stained dark with menadione-linked alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase even without the substrate of menadione, showing the histochemical characteristics of "reducing" body. The bodies were predominantly seen in fibers with disorganized intermyofibrillar networks and with high acid phosphatase activity. On electron microscopy, the reducing bodies consisted of fine granular material with the similar electron density to the chromatin granules and were located mostly around the degenerated nuclei, suggesting the nuclear degeneration playing a role in forming the reducing bodies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Document 4 (Title: [Releasing phenomenon of well learned praxis with right hand].): We report a case with "releasing phenomenon of well learned praxis" with right hand caused by cerebral infarction in the territory of left anterior cerebral artery. A 71-year-old right-handed woman suddenly developed motor paralysis in right lower and upper limbs associated with mutism. Motor paralysis of the right upper limb and speech disturbance improved gradually. At this period it was noted that she grasped and used an object in front of her with right hand against her own will. The neurological findings about one month after the onset of the disease revealed very mild weakness of the right upper extremity and severe motor paralysis of the right lower limb. In addition, tendon reflex was exaggerated in the right lower limb and sensory disturbance was noted in the region distal from the right knee. Neuropsychologically, ideomotor apraxia was observed in the left hand. Pathological gasping of the right hand was also noted. When the patient saw and touched an object, she used it with her right hand against her own will, and her left hand voluntarily hindered the right hand. This behavior is apparently similar with the "compulsive manipulation of tools" reported previously. However, the following hitherto unknown phenomena were observed in the present patient: Her right hand performed pantomimic movement for the use of objects orally described by the examiner without visually presenting them. The right hand also tended to imitate the gestures of the examiner automatically, even if the patient was not asked for imitating the gestures. These behavioral abnormalities of the right hand was thought to be liberated from the inhibition system.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Document 5 (Title: [Advanced stage of giant axonal neuropathy].): A woman has appeared normal during her neonatal and childhood period except for a short stature. Her parents were healthy and non-consanguineous. At the age of 8, she noticed difficulty in climbing stairs and had tendency to fall. In her 13th year, she developed marked scoliosis and genu valgum. Physical examination at 14 years of age revealed a gentle and shy child of short stature with brown-black kinky hair. Neurological examinations revealed progressive mental retardation, optic nerve atrophy, moderate and coarse nystagmus on lateral and vertical gaze, atrophic tongue with fasciculations, slow and scanning speech, distal muscular weaknesses with diffuse atrophies in the four extremities and sensory deficiencies in all modalities with a glove-stocking type distribution. At the age of 15, she was unable to walk without a wheelchair. During the course she showed slowly progressive muscular weakness, ataxia and decreasing sensation especially in the lower extremities. She died of infection of the respiratory and urinary tracts at the age of 25. Pathologically the abnormalities in the biopsied and autopsied sural nerve were characterized by an advanced stage of nerve fiber degeneration without giant axons. The phrenic nerve obtained at autopsy at 1 to 10 cm from axon terminal revealed the presence of several large focal axonal swelling of 15-20 microns in diameter. On the other hand, sections of the phrenic nerve at 15 cm from axon terminal displayed a mild to moderate reduction in the number of myelinated fibers without giant axons. The difference of pathological findings among these specimens seems to depend on the time as well as the site of the examination.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
