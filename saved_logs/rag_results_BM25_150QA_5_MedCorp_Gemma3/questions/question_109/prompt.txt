With your own knowledge and the help of the following document:

Document 1 (Title: Are we getting informed consent from patients with cancer?): We developed a consent form for a hypothetical trial and asked patients to underline information that was pertinent to their decision to accept or refuse to participate in the proposed trial. We also investigated whether patients correctly interpreted statements describing the probability of certain events occurring. Of the 50 patients, 74% did not indicate that both risks and benefits were pertinent. Of the 20 patients who would not enter the trial, 70% focused on risks of therapy only. In contrast, of the 30 who agreed to enter, only 33% focused entirely on risks, while 10% did not note potential for either benefit or risk. For each of four probability statements, patients chose one of four possible interpretations, only one of which was correct. Depending on the statement, between 26 and 54% of the interpretations were incorrect. It appears that many decisions regarding trial entry may be based upon incomplete or incorrect information.
Document 2 (Title: Underscore): As a marker for incorrectness Underline (typically red or wavy or both) is often used by spell checkers (and grammar checkers) to denote misspelled or otherwise incorrect text. Manuscripts Depending on local conventions, the following kinds of underlines may be used inline on manuscripts to indicate the special typefaces to be used: single dashed underline for , 'let it stand', proof-reading mark cancelled. single straight underline for italic type single wavy underline for bold type double straight underline for double underline of one straight line and one wavy line for bold italic triple underline for FULL CAPITAL LETTERS (used among small caps or to change text already typed as lower case).
Document 3 (Title: Seville Statement on Violence): Core Ideas The statement contains five core ideas. These ideas are: "It is scientifically incorrect to say that we have inherited a tendency to make war from our animal ancestors." "It is scientifically incorrect to say that war or any other violent behaviour is genetically programmed into our human nature." "It is scientifically incorrect to say that in the course of human evolution there has been a selection for aggressive behaviour more than for other kinds of behaviour." "It is scientifically incorrect to say that humans have a 'violent brain'." "It is scientifically incorrect to say that war is caused by 'instinct' or any single motivation." The statement concludes: "Just as 'wars begin in the minds of men', peace also begins in our minds. The same species who invented war is capable of inventing peace. The responsibility lies with each of us." Founding scientists The following is a list of the scientists who founded the statement:
Document 4 (Title: Controversies about the 2004 Madrid train bombings): Analysis of samples from the explosion sites carried out by a member of the bomb disposal squad (TEDAX) following the bombings did not produce a definitive result. The analyst concerned later testified in the trial of those accused of committing the bombings. She stated that the only thing she could identify in these tests were generic components of dynamite. Later in 2004, in his appearance before the parliamentary committee of inquiry, Juan Jesus Sánchez Manzano (the head of the TEDAX) stated that traces of nitroglycerine had been detected in the samples recovered after the bombings. He would later retract this statement before the investigating magistrate in charge of the case and emphasised that he was not an expert in explosives. The statement by Sánchez Manzano led supporters of the idea that ETA was involved in the bombings to question whether the explosive used in the bombs had been Goma 2 ECO. Nitroglycerine is not a component of Goma 2 ECO.
Document 5 (Title: Categorical proposition): All S are P. (A form) No S are P. (E form) Some S are P. (I form) Some S are not P. (O form) Surprisingly, a large number of sentences may be translated into one of these canonical forms while retaining all or most of the original meaning of the sentence. Greek investigations resulted in the so-called square of opposition, which codifies the logical relations among the different forms; for example, that an A-statement is contradictory to an O-statement; that is to say, for example, if one believes "All apples are red fruits," one cannot simultaneously believe that "Some apples are not red fruits." Thus the relationships of the square of opposition may allow immediate inference, whereby the truth or falsity of one of the forms may follow directly from the truth or falsity of a statement in another form.
