        "content": "We report here the use of the biochemical marker desialylated transferrin to aid in the diagnosis of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Conventional biochemical tests used for the detection of chronic alcohol consumption fail to differentiate nonalcoholic steatohepatitis patients from alcoholic subjects. In addition, even in those alcoholic subjects with alcoholic liver disease in whom biopsy has been performed, it is impossible to differentiate these two disease states on the basis of morphological examination alone. In this study we have examined two new markers of excessive alcohol intake, desialylated transferrin and mitochondrial AST in subjects with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and in patients consuming excessive amounts of alcohol. All nonalcoholic steatohepatitis patients consumed minimal or no alcohol and were diagnosed by morphological criteria based on liver biopsy specimens. Alcoholic subjects were consuming in excess of 80 gm/day ethanol, often with clinical evidence of overt alcoholism. Control subjects included both healthy controls and patient controls with liver diseases unrelated to alcohol. The ratio of desialylated transferrin/total transferrin was elevated only in patients who consumed excessive amounts of alcohol, whereas the ratio of mitochondrial AST to total AST (mitochondrial AST/total AST) was not significantly different between alcoholic subjects and patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. The sensitivity and specificity for the ratio desialylated transferrin/total transferrin was 81% and 98%, respectively, whereas the sensitivity for the mitochondrial AST/total AST ratio was 92%; the specificity was only 50%, indicating that there were a large number of false-positives. All the conventional markers were less sensitive and less specific than the ratio desialylated transferrin/total transferrin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "content": "Alcoholic versus non-alcoholic The most apparent distinguishing factor between alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a history of excessive alcohol use. Thus, in patients who have no or negligible alcohol use, the diagnosis is unlikely to be alcoholic hepatitis. However, in those who use alcohol, the diagnosis may just as likely be alcoholic or nonalcoholic hepatitis especially if there is concurrent obesity, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. In this case, alcoholic and nonalcoholic hepatitis can be distinguished by the pattern of liver enzyme abnormalities; specifically, in alcoholic steatohepatitis AST>ALT with ratio of AST:ALT>2:1 while in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ALT>AST with ratio of ALT:AST>1.5:1.",

Mere deposition of fat in the liver is termed steatosis, and together these constitute fatty liver changes.

Risk factors for NAFLD include diabetes, obesity and metabolic syndrome. When inflammation is present it is referred to as alcoholic steatohepatitis and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Steatohepatitis of either cause may progress to cirrhosis, and NASH is now believed to be a frequent cause of unexplained cirrhosis (at least in Western societies).

        "content": "Forty-two patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis were followed for a median of 4.5 yr (range = 1.5 to 21.5 yr). Except for two patients with lipodystrophy, all were obese; 35 of 42 were women, 26 of 32 were hyperlipidemic and 15 were hyperglycemic. Upper abdominal pain was the most common reason for presentation. Initial liver biopsy specimens showed the presence of macrovesicular fatty infiltration, lobular (acinar) inflammation, apoptosis, Mallory bodies (in four cases) and fibrosis (in 18 cases). Cirrhosis was present at initial diagnosis in one subject and in another two subjects liver biopsy showed marked fibrosis with disturbed architecture. Serial liver biopsy specimens revealed minimal or no apparent progression of the disorder in most of the patients, in keeping with their benign clinical course. However, one patient showed progression from fibrosis to cirrhosis during the 5-yr observation period, and in the patients with extensive fibrosis the liver disease evolved from one of active inflammation to one of inactive cirrhosis without fat or inflammation. The patient with cirrhosis later died of hepatocellular carcinoma. The severity or type of hepatic change did not correlate with the degree of obesity, hyperlipidemia or hyperglycemia. However, in individual patients, poorly controlled diabetes and rapid weight loss preceded the onset of steatohepatitis. We conclude that nonalcoholic steatohepatitis is a cause of hepatic inflammation histologically resembling that of alcohol-induced liver disease but usually slowly progressive and of low-grade severity. However, the disorder may ultimately result in cirrhosis. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis should be distinguished from alcoholic steatohepatitis and recognized as a further cause of \"cryptogenic cirrhosis.\"",
