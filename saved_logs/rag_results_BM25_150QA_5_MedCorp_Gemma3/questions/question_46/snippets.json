        "title": "Nasal oxygen alleviates hypoxemia in colonoscopy patients sedated with midazolam and meperidine.",
        "content": "A randomized study was carried out to determine whether the administration of oxygen (3 liter/min) via nasal prongs significantly affects arterial oxygenation during colonoscopy in patients sedated with intravenous midazolam (2.6 +/- 0.2 mg, means +/- SE) and meperidine (48 +/- 3 mg). Patients who received supplemental oxygen were less likely to become hypoxic (pulse oximeter reading, SpO2 less than 90%) than those who breathed room air (10 of 28 vs. 22 of 28, p less than 0.005). Similarly, the total time during which SpO2 was below 90% was significantly less in patients receiving nasal oxygen (0.7 +/- 0.3 min) than in patients breathing room air (9.7 +/- 1.9 min, p less than 0.001). Minimum oxygen saturations were significantly higher in patients receiving oxygen (90.6 +/- 0.8%) than in patients breathing air (86.5 +/- 0.8%, p less than 0.001). In patients breathing air, there was a significant negative correlation between the dose of meperidine and the minimum observed oxygen saturation; conversely, midazolam dose did not correlate with indices of hypoxemia. The authors conclude that administration of oxygen via nasal prongs can reduce the risk of hypoxemia during colonoscopy. However, since hypoxemia may occur even when nasal oxygen is given, continuous monitoring of arterial oxygenation is recommended.",

        "content": "A 25-year old man with 5-year history of bronchiectasis was admitted to the ICU complaining of severe shortness of breath. He had a respiratory rate of 40 to 50 breath/min. On 0.5 l/min of oxygen with nasal cannula, arterial blood pH was 7.39, Paco2 52.3 mmHg, Pao2 45.0 mmHg. Then, on 1 l/min of oxygen, Pao2 was unchanged, but Paco2 increased to 58 mmHg. As his consciousness was so clear, we applied to him the negative extra-thoracic pressure ventilator which was designed by the authors. Negative extra-thoracic pressure ventilation (NETPV) was maintained at a IMV rate of 30 breath/min, peak negative extra-thoracic pressure of -20 to -30 cmH2O, and an inspiratory/expiratory ratio of 1:2. During NETPV, his respiratory rate and oxygen consumption were decreased and Pao2 was increased compared with his spontaneous breathing. He made a recovery from dyspnea, especially, he was able to take a deep breath. When NETPV was applied to him, pulmonary artery and arterial catheterizations revealed that central venous pressure was slightly decreased, cardiac index unchanged or slightly decreased, heart rate, systemic blood pressure, and pulmonary arterial pressure unchanged compared with spontaneous breathing. The patient was able to read books and maintained communication in his voice with his family and the medical staff. After 3 days of the treatment with NETPV, a marked improvement was noted and the patient was discharged from the ICU. NETPV has the benefits as follows. First, it is very easy for both a patient and a doctor to assist his breathing because an endotracheal intubation is not necessary.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
