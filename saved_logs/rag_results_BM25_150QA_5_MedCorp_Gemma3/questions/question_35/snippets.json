        "content": "Philip J. Rosenthal, MD A 5-year-old American girl presents with a 1-week history of intermittent chills, fever, and sweats. She had returned home 2 weeks earlier after leaving the USA for the first time to spend 3 weeks with her grandparents in Nigeria. She received all standard childhood immunizations, but no additional treat-ment before travel, since her parents have returned to their native Nigeria frequently without medical consequences. Three days ago, the child was seen in an outpatient clinic and diagnosed with a viral syndrome. Examination reveals a lethargic child, with a temperature of 39.8\u00b0C (103.6\u00b0F) and splenomegaly. She has no skin rash or lymphadenopathy. Ini-tial laboratory studies are remarkable for hematocrit 29.8%, platelets 45,000/mm3, creatinine 2.5 mg/dL (220 \u03bcmol/L), and mildly elevated bilirubin and transaminases. A blood smear shows ring forms of Plasmodium falciparum at 1.5% parasit-emia. What treatment should be started?",

        "content": "We report on the clinical, epidemiologic, and laboratory characteristics of the first case of human ehrlichiosis acquired outside the United States caused by an Ehrlichia sp. other than E. sennetsu. The patient, a 24-year-old woman, presumably acquired the infection in Mali in northern Africa; the diagnosis was made when she returned to North America. The patient reported a fever and diarrhea a week before she left Mali; the diarrhea resolved, but the fever and chills continued. She also reported intermittent tingling in both hands and feet and muscle discomfort. Her temperature was 37.8 degrees C and her pulse rate was 100 per minute. She had two erythematous maculopapules (0.5 x 0.7 mm) on her thigh and ankle that resembled infected insect bites. Her hemoglobin level was 148 g/l with normal indices, and her white blood cell count was 10, 500/mm3 with many atypical lymphocytes and platelets. This report is intended to increase physicians' awareness of ehrlichiosis in foreign travelers and other patients, and suggests the need for further research to determine the prevalence and distribution of this disease.",

        "content": "A 77-year-old woman with a 9 years history of Parkinson's disease was admitted to our hospital because of high fever, disturbance of consciousness, increased muscular rigidity and abnormal involuntary movements. She was continuously treated with levodopa + carbidopa (Menesit) 300 mg and amantadine 150 mg every day until admission. On admission, the pulse rate was 102 per minute, blood pressure 90/40 mmHg, body temperature 40.9 degrees C, and bloody stool was noticed. On laboratory examination, erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 6 mm/h, thrombocytes 8.1 X 10(4)/microliters, fibrinogen 91 mg/dl, FDP 40 mg/ml, suggesting DIC. According to her biochemical examination, serum GOT (167 u), GPT (119 u), CPK (847 IU/l), BUN (53.9 mg/dl) and myoglobin (10,370 ng/ml) were increased. These laboratory data indicated that she was suffering from neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). On diagnosis of NMS associated with DIC, she was treated with dantrolene and FUT-175. Dantrolene was effective on the elevated COK level and FUT-175 was effective on the DIC, and symptoms of NMS and DIC were completely improved after a period of 14 days. Patients with Parkinson's disease have been suspected to have a low incidence of DIC, and this may be the first case report on successful treatment of levodopa-induced NMS with DIC in the patient with Parkinson's disease.",
