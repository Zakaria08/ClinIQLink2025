Document 1 (Title: [A case of miliary tuberculosis associated with acute respiratory failure during pregnancy].): A case of miliary tuberculosis associated with acute respiratory failure during pregnancy was reported. A 39-year-old, 29-week pregnant woman was admitted to our hospital with complaints of nonproductive cough and fever on June 12. On admission, her temperature was 38.2 degrees C; pulse rate was 90/min., and blood pressure was 120/76 mmHg. Physical examination revealed moist rales at right lung basis. Chest X-ray showed small nodular infiltrates in right lower lung field. Laboratory data revealed positive CRP, accelerated ESR and increased level of alpha 2-globulin. The number of T-cells was markedly decreased (14/mm3). The PPD skin test was negative, and the sputum smears for acid-fast bacilli were negative. Suspected of bacterial or viral pneumonia, the patient was treated with antibiotics (CPM, EM and CAZ), which had no effects for her. On June 16, the Chest X-ray showed infiltrates throughout bilateral lung fields, and the patient became increasingly dyspneic. On June 18, the results of arterial blood gas, analysis under room air were: PaO2 26.7 Torr, PaCO2 29.0 Torr, pH 7.505. Because of severe hypoxemia, she was intubated and placed on a volume-cycled respirator. Hydrocortisone (1000 mg, daily) was added to treatment because ARDS was suspected. Since the smears of tracheobronchial secretions showed acid-fast bacilli on June 24, she was diagnosed to have miliary tuberculosis. Then the intensive therapy with antituberculosis drugs (isoniazid 400 mg, rifampicin 450 mg, and streptomycin 1g, daily) was started. The non specific antibiotics were discontinued; hydrocortisone was tapered and stopped. The next week, she became afebrile and hypoxemia steadily improved.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Document 2 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): Her social history is significant for alcohol use (three to four glasses of wine/night). Her vital signs include the following: temperature 99.8°F, blood pressure 132/64 mm Hg, pulse 78 bpm, and respiratory rate 15/min. On physical examination, she had left upper abdominal tenderness with evidence of hepatomegaly and mild scleral icterus. Laboratory data revealed the following: alanine aminotransferase, 527 IU/L (normal 10–35 IU/L); aspartate aminotransferase, 425 IU/L (normal < 35 IU/L); and bilirubin, 2.9 mg/dL (normal 0.1–0.3 mg/dL). What medications do OTC cold and flu preparations typically contain? Which of the OTC medications might have contrib-uted to the patient’s current symptoms? KH, a 55-year-old woman, presents to the emergency department with nausea, vomiting, and complaints of new-onset flu symptoms over the past several days. Her past medical history is significant for allergic rhinitis and chronic lower back pain secondary to a work-related fall 2 years ago. Her

Ultrasound reveals a deep vein thrombosis in the left lower extremity; chest computed tomography scan confirms the presence of pulmonary emboli. Laboratory blood tests indicate elevated d-dimer levels. What therapy is indicated acutely? What are the long-term therapy options? How long should she be treated? Should this indi-vidual use oral contraceptives? A 25-year-old woman presents to the emergency depart-ment complaining of acute onset of shortness of breath and pleuritic pain. She had been in her usual state of health until 2 days prior when she noted that her left leg was swollen and red. Her only medication was oral contraceptives. Family history was significant for a history of “blood clots” in mul-tiple members of the maternal side of her family. Physical examination demonstrates an anxious woman with stable vital signs.

Document 4 (Title: [Use of erythrocytapheresis in a pregnant woman with sickle cell anemia].): A case is reported of a 23 yr old pregnant woman from Zaire in whom homozygous sickle-cell disease was discovered at her first obstetrical visit at 25 week amenorrhea. She had had two previous pregnancies: the first one had been voluntarily interrupted; the second one went to term, but the child, born in a state of apparent death, died on the third day. Despite severe normocytic anaemia (5 mmol.l-1 haemoglobin, 2.9 T.l-1 erythrocytes, 0.25 haematocrit, 93 fl mean globular volume), she was symptomless. The diagnosis was confirmed by haemoglobin electrophoresis: 0 haemoglobin A (HbA) and 0.854 haemoglobin S (HbS). Because foetal growth and maturation appeared satisfactory, no procedure to increase the HbA/HbS ratio was used before the 37th week of amenorrhea. At that time, erythrocytapheresis was carried out using a discontinuous flow cell separator. Eight phenotyped red cell packs without leukocytes (removed by filtration) were transfused; at the end of the procedure, there was 0.67 HbA and 0.25 HbS. At 39 week amenorrhea, haemoglobin electrophoresis gave 0.43 HbA and 0.47 HbS. No further treatment was therefore given. At the 40th week, she gave birth to a healthy girl, Apgar score 10 at 1 min. She was given two further red cell packs at start of labour, because her haemoglobin level had fallen to 6.4 mmol.l-1. In the immediate postpartum, her HbS level was 0.38. The aims, advantages and disadvantages of the different techniques available for the treatment of homozygous sickle-cell anaemia in pregnancy are discussed.
Document 5 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): A 59-year-old woman presents to an urgent care clinic with a 4-day history of frequent and painful urination. She has had fevers, chills, and flank pain for the past 2 days. Her physician advised her to come immediately to the clinic for evaluation. In the clinic she is febrile (38.5°C [101.3°F]) but otherwise stable and states she is not experiencing any nausea or vomiting. Her urine dipstick test is positive for leukocyte esterase. Urinalysis and urine culture are ordered. Her past medical history is significant for three urinary tract infections in the past year. Each episode was uncom-plicated, treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and promptly resolved. She also has osteoporosis for which she takes a daily calcium supplement. The decision is made to treat her with oral antibiotics for a complicated urinary tract infection with close follow-up. Given her history, what would be a reasonable empiric antibiotic choice? Depending on the antibiotic choice are there potential drug

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
Question: A 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presents with burning upon urination. She states it started 1 day ago and has been worsening despite drinking more water and taking cranberry extract. She otherwise feels well and is followed by a doctor for her pregnancy. Her temperature is 97.7°F (36.5°C), blood pressure is 122/77 mmHg, pulse is 80/min, respirations are 19/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is notable for an absence of costovertebral angle tenderness and a gravid uterus. Which of the following is the best treatment for this patient?
Options:
A. Ampicillin
B. Ceftriaxone
C. Doxycycline
D. Nitrofurantoin
