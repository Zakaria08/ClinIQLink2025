Document 1 (Title: [Elderly non-Hodgkin's lymphoma presenting with pulmonary squamous cell carcinoma as a complication of chemotherapy for malignant lymphoma].): The authors report a case of pulmonary squamous cell carcinoma which occurred after chemotherapy of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). A 76-year-old man, who was admitted to our department because of swelling of cervical lymph nodes, was diagnosed as having NHL (follicular mixed cell lymphoma). He was treated with 11 courses of CHOP therapy. Thereafter, chemotherapy including ifosfamide was carried out for approximately three years. In June, 1991, he was readmitted to our department because of swelling and pain in his left thigh and an abnormal shadow on chest X-ray. Chest CT demonstrated a cavitated shadow (about 5 cm in diameter) with an irregular margin in right S1, which was suggested to be lung cancer or pulmonary infiltration of malignant lymphoma. Bronchoscopy, which was carried out on July 12, showed bloody sputa from the right B1 ramus and markedly reddened mucosa at the orifice of the right upper bronchus. Sputum cytology revealed no malignancy. ACVP-16 chemotherapy including ara-C, CBDCA and VP-16 was initiated on July 14 because of enlarged superficial lymph nodes. On July 18, he fell out of bed and fractured his left femur. He also suffered from respiratory failure. He died of pulmonary haemorrhage on July 26. Autopsy revealed pulmonary squamous cell carcinoma. The occurrence of pulmonary squamous cell carcinoma is rare after the chemotherapy of malignant lymphoma.
Document 2 (Title: [Fulminant hepatitis cured by plasma exchange in a patient with acute leukemia--a case report].): A 16-year-old male with acute myelogenous leukemia (M1) presented with fulminant hepatitis (massive hepatic necrosis). He achieved a complete remission with the administration of AdVP (doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone), and thereafter received consolidation or intensification therapy 5 times in combination with AdVP plus enocitabine. A bone marrow examination carried out before the 6th round of chemotherapy revealed a slight increase of myeloblast (7%). L-AdVP (including l-asparaginase in addition to AdVP) was administered with a good result. However, 13 days after the end of the therapy he complained of acute abdominal pain, headache and fever. The following day, his consciousness level became lower and severe jaundice appeared. The serum transaminase level highly elevated with PT and aPTT severely elongated. He was diagnosed as having fulminant hepatitis. Elevation of the titer of IgM-HBc suggested that the fulminant hepatitis was attributed to HBV, which was probably transmitted by blood transfusion done in the first induction therapy and stayed latent during immunosuppressive chemotherapy. After receiving 10 sessions of plasma exchange (3.2 l/day), he recovered, free from any major complications except posttransfusion hepatitis. In his serum taken at 1 month after the recovery of posttransfusion hepatitis, HCV (Chiron) antibody was detected. There have been few reports concerning fulminant hepatitis associated with acute leukemia. In this case, plasma exchange was very effective in treating fulminant hepatitis.
Document 3 (Title: [von Recklinghausen's disease associated with malignant lymphoma].): A 59-year-old man was admitted to the Saga Medical School Hospital in November 1986 because of unconsciousness and lymph node swelling. He had café au leit spots and multiple neurofibromas since his thirties. The leukocyte count was increased. The level of serum LDH and Ca were extremely elevated. His bone marrow aspiration showed the invasion of lymphoma cells. Lymph node biopsy from his left neck and the study of surface markers were performed. And then, his illness was diagnosed as non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (diffuse, medium sized cell type, B cell type, stage IV B.) following von Recklinghausen's disease. After the admission, his general condition improved by chemotherapy, but he had a relapse 6 months later. And he died in November 1987. The case of von Recklinghausen's disease associated with malignant lymphoma in rarely reported. We reviewed the literature and discussed von Recklinghausen's disease associated with malignant lymphoma including this case.
Document 4 (Title: ABVD): ABVD is a chemotherapy regimen used in the first-line treatment of Hodgkin lymphoma, replacing the older MOPP protocol. It consists of concurrent treatment with the chemotherapy drugs: Adriamycin (also known as doxorubicin/hydroxydaunorubicin, designated as H in CHOP) Bleomycin Vinblastine Dacarbazine (similar to procarbazine, designated as P in MOPP and in COPP) Medical uses As of 2007, ABVD is widely used as the initial chemotherapy treatment for newly diagnosed Hodgkin lymphoma. It has been the most effective and least toxic chemotherapy regimen available for treating early-stage Hodgkin Lymphoma. The other chemotherapy regimens that are widely used in this setting is the Stanford V and BEACOPP regimens. Administration
Document 5 (Title: [Peripheral blood involvement accompanied with hypercalcemia in the malignant lymphoma of iliac bone].): We reported a rare case of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of iliac bone which developed peripheral blood involvement associated with hypercalcemia. 42-year-old man was admitted to Fukui Medical School Hospital because of right iliac bone pain. An X-ray film of the pelvis disclosed the osteolytic change of right iliac bone. A CT scan of the pelvis showed soft tissue density tumors involved bilateral iliac bone. He had no superficial lymphadenopathy or organomegaly. Examination of peripheral blood and bone marrow did not show any abnormalities. Monoclonal immunoglobulin was not detected in serum. Examination of biopsied specimens from iliac bone tumor showed infiltration of round cells. Immunocytochemical analysis showed only MT-1 positive. He was treated with combination chemotherapy of vindesine, cyclophosphamide, prednisolone and pirarubicin followed by radiation therapy. But, there was no significant response. Following radiation therapy, he developed coma. Serum calcium was 9.8 mEq/l. The pathologic immature cells were found in peripheral blood. The bone marrow aspirates showed 63% pathologic cells. These cells expressed CD19, CD20, HLA-DR antigens. He was diagnosed as having leukemic non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, B-cell type, and was treated with combination chemotherapy. But he died of systemic fungal infection.
