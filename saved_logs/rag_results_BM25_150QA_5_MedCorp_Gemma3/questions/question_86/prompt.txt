Document 1 (Title: University of Worcester): In August 2010 the university was granted research degree-awarding powers, enabling it to confer the awards of MPhil and PhD. Before this Coventry University assisted in the academic awarding of these degrees. The university includes eight national research centres: The National Pollen and Aerobiology Research Unit from where all UK national pollen forecasts originate, and testing of new hay fever and anti-allergen devices is conducted. The Centre for Rural Research, which examined the psychological effects of the mass flooding in the UK in recent years. The International Centre for Children's Literature, Literacy and Creativity is, with University of Cambridge and Roehampton University, one of the three UK university centres to employ full-time children's literature professors.
Document 2 (Title: An aerobiological survey of allergens in al Khobar, Saudi Arabia.): A nationwide aerobiologic study is in progress in Saudi Arabia using Burkard 7-day volumetric spore traps to determine the major airborne allergens and their seasonal patterns. Eights months readings have been completed at Al-Khobar, an important coastal city on the Arabian Gulf. Pollen levels showed a double season. An autumnal peak reached its maximum in October rising sharply from the low summer values before falling during the short winter then rising again in springtime. Both local and imported flora were represented with chenopodiaceae, grasses and Ambrosia as the most common botanical groups, identification of the most significant individual species is still in progress. Fungal spores also show distinctive seasonal patterns. In descending rank order from the most common genera were Cladosporium, Ustilago, Alternaria, with Chaetomium and Ulocladium as consistent but minor components. Basiodiospores and Ascospores represented less than 10% of the total spore population, indicative of the dry nature of the climate. Desert dust added an important irritant to the Saudi atmosphere but a major contaminating factor to the aerobiological material being analysed.
Document 3 (Title: Grass pollen allergens: detection on pollen grain surface using membrane print technique.): A microtechnique is described to visualize pollen allergens by making prints from the surface of mature grains on nitrocellulose membrane. The allergen Lol p I is detected by specific monoclonal antibodies or specific IgE from sera of grass-pollen-allergic patients, visualized by the immunoperoxidase method. This technique offers the potential to study the distribution of individual allergens in aerobiology samples by bright-field microscopy, and to determine the sensitivity spectra of allergic individuals to known and unknown pollen sources.
Document 4 (Title: Aerobiology): Aerobiology (from Greek ἀήρ, aēr, "air"; βίος, bios, "life"; and -λογία, -logia) is a branch of biology that studies organic particles, such as bacteria, fungal spores, very small insects, pollen grains and viruses, which are passively transported by the air. Aerobiologists have traditionally been involved in the measurement and reporting of airborne pollen and fungal spores as a service to allergy sufferers. The first finding of airborne algae took place in Germany in 1910.

Document 5 (Title: Aeroallergens in dairy barns near Cooperstown, New York and Rochester, Minnesota.): We sampled atmospheric barn air using a volumetric air sampler in ten barns near Cooperstown, NY and six barns near Rochester, MN, and, with radioimmunoassays, measured allergens of Aspergillus fumigatus, Thermoactinomyces vulgaris, Micropolyspori faeni, short ragweed, rye grass group I pollen, Alternaria (Alt-1), Dermatophagoides sp. Lepidoglyphus destructor, common insect allergen, mouse urine, rat urine, and cattle epithelium. The most abundant allergen present was A. fumigatus followed by L. destructor. This study provides initial data on barn aerobiology and demonstrates for the first time the abundance of L. destructor allergens in North American dairy barns. More comprehensive study of barns, poultry houses, confinement houses for swine, and other agricultural environments from various geographic locations is needed to define the allergen levels to which millions of farm workers are exposed each day. While most of the allergens were expected, the presence of airborne allergens reactive with antisera to Dermatophagoides suggests indirectly that substantial amounts of pyroglyphid mites are present in some barns.
