The results of reviews of acupuncture's efficacy, however, have been inconclusive. In January 2020, David Gorski analyzed a 2020 review of systematic reviews (\"Acupuncture for the Relief of Chronic Pain: A Synthesis of Systematic Reviews\") concerning the use of acupuncture to treat chronic pain. Writing in Science-Based Medicine, Gorski said that its findings highlight the conclusion that acupuncture is \"a theatrical placebo whose real history has been retconned beyond recognition.\" He also said this review \"reveals the many weaknesses in the design of acupuncture clinical trials\".",

According to some acupuncturists, this practice augments the use of regular acupuncture, can restore health and well-being, and is particularly good for treating pain. There is evidence for some efficacy (when used in addition to antiemetics) in treating moderate post-chemotherapy vomiting, but not for acute vomiting or delayed nausea severity.

This treatment is used to treat both the Wet and Dry forms of AMD. This study was based on Ngok Cheng's research on the increased amounts of ATP levels in living tissue after being stimulated with microcurrent. Mechanisms of action While the mechanisms of efficacy are not well established, a few studies have shown that there may be a correlation between the traditional Chinese medical system of acupuncture and microcurrent.

However currently only oxybutynin has an FDA-approved labeled indication in children aged 6 and older. An additional third-line alternative shown to be effective is the tricylic antidepressant imipramine, however the use of tricylic antidepressants carries the risk of cardiotoxicity and is not recommended to be given without evaluating a person's risk factors for certain heart diseases. Acupuncture There are multiple studies examining the efficacy of acupuncture in treating nocturnal enuresis in children, but the evidence is generally of low quality and suffers from multiple limitations. Therefore, there is not strong evidence to suggest that acupuncture is useful for treating enuresis.",

        "content": "Antagonists are plantar-flexors of the posterior compartment such as soleus and gastrocnemius. The movements of tibialis anterior are dorsiflexion and inversion of the ankle. However, actions of tibialis anterior are dependent on whether the foot is weight bearing or not (closed or open kinetic chain). When the foot is on the ground, the muscle helps to balance the leg and talus on the other tarsal bones so that the leg is kept vertical even when walking on uneven ground. Clinical significance Some clinicians attempt to treat tibialis anterior muscle issues with acupuncture techniques, such as dry needling. There is significant bias in studies evaluating the efficacy of acupuncture versus medical treatments, and the decision to use acupuncture should be made carefully.",
