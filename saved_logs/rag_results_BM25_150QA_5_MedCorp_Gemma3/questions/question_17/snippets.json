        "content": "A 24-year-old white male with no known medical history presented to the hospital\u00a0with chief complaints of 2 weeks of progressively worsening pain and swelling of his right\u00a0wrist\u00a0and left ankle joints. He did not report any fevers, chills, night sweats, weight loss\u00a0or rash. He was employed as a fireman. He denied alcohol use disorder,\u00a0smoking cigarettes, or any recreational drugs. Family history was significant for hypertension in father and ovarian cancer in the mother.\u00a0His vital signs were within normal limits on presentation. On\u00a0physical examination, the patient had\u00a0significant swelling of multiple joints\u00a0including the right wrist, right elbow, and left ankle. The joints were\u00a0erythematous and tender to touch. Due to severe pain, he had limited range in the involved joints.",

        "content": "A 38-year-old African American male, who emigrated from Somalia 10 years ago, presented with a 6-month history of lower extremity swelling, 20-pound (9 kg) weight gain over 4 weeks, and new-onset microscopic hematuria. He had no prior history of edema, proteinuria, or hematuria. There was no prior history of any systemic illness or any heart, lung, or kidney disease. He reported no over-the-counter drug use, herbal medication use, or NSAID intake. His review of systems was positive for lethargy, fatigue, and edema at his lower extremities. His family history was negative for any kidney disease. He reported a monogamous relationship with his wife and no current or past alcohol or drug use. His medical history included recently diagnosed hypertension, latent tuberculosis, and anemia. His vital signs included a blood pressure of 160/90 and a heart rate of 78.",

        "content": "His physical exam revealed clear lungs and a normal heart exam on auscultation. His abdomen was soft and non-tender, and his skin was warm and dry with no rash. He had 2 plus pitting edema at the ankles. Initial laboratory data was consistent with acute kidney injury (AKI) with worsening creatinine from 1.2 to 1.6 over 1 month and nephrotic range proteinuria. Serologies for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, anti-nuclear antibody (ANA), c-ANCA, serine protease 3 (PR3) IgG, myeloperoxidase antibody (MPO), and complement levels were sent. He was started on losartan for proteinuria with plans for renal biopsy; however, he was lost to follow up. The patient then presented two weeks later with worsening edema to his waist, continued weight gain, mild hemoptysis, and streaks of blood in the stool. Physical examination now showed worsening pitting edema up to his waist with new non-pruritic, erythematous excoriations on the medial aspect of his thighs bilaterally. He was admitted to the hospital with concern for worsening vasculitis. He was started on oral prednisone and underwent a renal biopsy. For his edema, he was started on diuretics to which he responded well. Due to persistent leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing was performed to complete the workup.",

        "title": "[Paraplegia after spinal anesthesia].",
        "content": "A case of paraplegia occurring after a spinal anaesthetic is reported. The 79-year-old man was admitted for a fractured neck of femur. Twenty years previously, he had had pharyngeal surgery and a tracheostomy. He had also undergone a prostatectomy for prostate cancer, and had been on oestrogen therapy for two years. He complained of dyspnoea at rest and his chest film showed diffuse pulmonary opacities. In order to avoid possible intubation and respiratory complications, spinal anaesthesia was performed without any problems in the L4 space. After the surgery, the patient recovered all his motor and sensory functions in the lower limbs. On the second postoperative day, he suffered from a motor paralysis of the right leg, which spread to the left leg on the fourth day. NMR imaging showed several vertebral metastases, together with anterior and lateral epidural invasion responsible for cord compression. Treatment with tetracosactide was begun, but the patient died six weeks later in his home, not having recovered any neurological function at all in his lower limbs. In fact, it was only after the procedure that the anaesthetist was informed that, at the time the prostate cancer had been diagnosed, vertebral body metastases, of which the patient had not been informed, were already present. The part played by the spinal anaesthetic in the occurrence of the paraplegia is not clear. It is reminded that such a technique should be used with extreme care in patients having a neoplasm with a very often high incidence of vertebral metastases.",

        "content": "A 71-year-old man was admitted to the Wake Forest University/Baptist Hospital Medical Center on February 1, 1989, with pharyngitis and a cutaneous eruption that began that day. The past history was significant for a diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) made in 1984, and for longstanding hypertension, severe coronary artery disease, and prostatic hypertrophy. The patient had required no therapy for his CLL until August, 1988, when he developed hemolytic anemia and was treated with oral chlorambucil, 4 mg/day, and a tapering course of prednisone. By December, 1988, the prednisone therapy had been discontinued, but the patient required hospital admission for pneumococcal pneumonia, which responded well to intravenous antibiotic therapy. One day prior to the current admission the patient complained of persistent fevers, sore throat, productive cough, and headache. He noted a new cutaneous eruption on the day of admission in February, 1989. The past history was positive for occasional herpes stomatitis. The patient did not know if he had previously been infected with varicella. Skin examination revealed multiple (greater than 20), single, and grouped vesicles in a generalized distribution involving the bilateral trunk, head, neck, arms, and legs. The heaviest involvement was on the right posterior auricular area and on the neck. A Tzanck preparation obtained from an early lesion was positive for multinucleated giant cells. Viral culture was negative at 24 hours and at 1 week. A skin biopsy of an early vesicular lesion was performed and revealed intraepidermal vesicles with acantholysis and giant cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
