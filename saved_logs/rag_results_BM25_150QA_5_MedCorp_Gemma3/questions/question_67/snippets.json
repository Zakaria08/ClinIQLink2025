        "title": "Relationship of self-concept to nutrient intake and eating patterns in young women.",
        "content": "The relationships between attitudes toward oneself (self-concept) and nutrition-related behavior were examined for 153 single women aged 18 to 35 years. Nutrition-related behaviors were assessed with 3-day food records that were analyzed for nutrient composition and eating patterns (Basic Four Food Group scores, number of meals per day, and percent of energy from meals and snacks). Attitudes toward self, knowledge and attitudes about nutrition, and general health practices were assessed with a written questionnaire that incorporated several existing scales. Because of potential overlap among the three self-concept scales, as well as nutrition-attitude and health-practice items, responses were factor analyzed, yielding 14 factors. These factors were then compared with nutrient intake and eating patterns. Scores for the seemingly desirable factors of the \"Super Person\" or \"Do Your Own Thing\" were negatively correlated with intake of several nutrients; scores on the self-perception of a \"Traditional\" orientation to life were positively related to calcium intake and meal patterns. The \"Nutrition Is Important\" and \"Nutrition Knowledge\" factors were also positively related to desirable eating patterns and nutrient intakes. We conclude that several self-concept variables, as well as nutrition attitudes and knowledge, can potentially influence nutrient intakes and eating patterns in young women.",

        "title": "What Irish schoolchildren know about AIDS.",
        "content": "AIDS in the Republic of Ireland has so far mainly been associated with intravenous drug use. However, because of growing public pressure to mount an AIDS campaign aimed at potentially vulnerable sub-groups, we conducted a survey of knowledge and attitudes related to AIDS among 891 Irish schoolchildren in the senior years of secondary school. Although virtually none of the children had received any classroom education on AIDS and no national education programme had been undertaken at the time of the survey, levels of knowledge were high among the pupils studied, and compared favourably with levels found using the same questionnaire among San Franciscan pupils. Higher levels of knowledge were found among urban pupils and, although some sex differences in knowledge emerged, there was no consistent pattern in these. No school surveyed showed sufficient misinformation to warrant a systematic education programme.",

        "title": "Sexuality of nurses: correlations of knowledge, attitudes, and behavior.",
        "content": "In a study of relationships among knowledge, attitudes, and statements of nursing behavior about sexuality, degree of comfort with sexual situations was measured with a Professional Sexual Role Inventory (PSRI), using ridit analysis. The PSRI and the Sex Knowledge and Attitude Test were administered in groups to 107 professional family planning nurses and 64 senior nursing students. The major hypothesis--the more knowledge a nurse has of human sexuality, the more favorable will be her attitude toward it and the more comfortable she will be in professional situations with sexual overtones--was supported. Significant positive correlations between sexual knowledge and attitudes and written responses indicated comfort in handling sexual situations. Analyses of variance of the test scores--by age, race, marital status, religion, religiosity, frequency of church attendance, and urbanization--demonstrated areas of sexuality which might be incorporated into nursing inservice training and education.",

        "title": "Predicting AIDS patient care intentions among nursing students.",
        "content": "Predictors of intentions to care for AIDS patients were examined among 153 sophomore and senior nursing students. Multiple regression analysis revealed that students who had relatively less AIDS knowledge and who perceived greater occupational risk of HIV infection expressed stronger intentions to avoid caring for AIDS patients. However, avoidance intentions were not simply a function of concern about personal health and inadequate knowledge. Students who held more negative attitudes toward intravenous drug users also had stronger intentions to avoid caring for AIDS patients, even when the effects of AIDS knowledge and perceived occupational risk of HIV infection were controlled. AIDS content is incorporated in the nursing curriculum for these students beginning in the junior year. Multivariate analysis of variance performed to determine the effects of this content revealed a significant effect for year in school considering all the dependent variables simultaneously. Seniors had lower avoidance intentions, lower perceived occupational risk, and greater AIDS knowledge than did sophomores.",

        "content": "A questionnaire survey was conducted in the Wellington area among 696 senior secondary school pupils. The first part of the questionnaire studied aspects of sexual knowledge and the sources of information. The general level of knowledge was good at an elementary level but less than adequate when more detailed knowledge was considered. The role of peers, parents and schools was complementary. In the second part of the questionnaire a standard attitude test was administered. A majority of young people in this survey supported a standard of permissiveness with affection and did not support a double standard giving greater rights to males. Boys were more permissive than girls.",
