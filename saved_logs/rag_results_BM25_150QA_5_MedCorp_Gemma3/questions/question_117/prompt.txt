Document 4 (Title: Crush syndrome): Crush syndrome can directly come from compartment syndrome, if the injury is left untreated. Symptoms include the 5 Ps: pain, pallor, paresthesias (pins and needles), paralysis, and pulselessness. Treatment There is no distinct treatment option that can undo the effects and damage from rhabdomyolysis because it is a necrosis. However, the rate of the pathology that can lead to more complications can be decreased by acting early and consistently. Overall treatment depends on preventing kidney failure (renal failure) which is done by rehydrating the patient. It also depends on making urine have a more basic pH (alkalinization of urine). Immediate untreated crush syndrome death is caused by severe head injury, torso injury with damaged abdominal organs, and asphyxia (excessive loss of oxygen). Early untreated crush syndrome death is caused by hyperkalemia and by hypovolemic shock. Late untreated crush syndrome death is caused by renal failure, coagulopathy and hemorrhage, and sepsis.
