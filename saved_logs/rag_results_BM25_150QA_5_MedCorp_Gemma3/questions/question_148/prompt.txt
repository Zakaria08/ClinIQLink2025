Document 1 (Title: Predicate transformer semantics): Monotonic Predicate transformers of interest (wp, wlp, and sp) are monotonic. A predicate transformer T is monotonic if and only if: This property is related to the consequence rule of Hoare logic. Strict A predicate transformer T is strict iff: For instance, wp is strict, whereas wlp is generally not. In particular, if statement S may not terminate then is satisfiable. We have Indeed, true is a valid invariant of that loop. Terminating A predicate transformer T is terminating iff: Actually, this terminology makes sense only for strict predicate transformers: indeed, is the weakest-precondition ensuring termination of S. It seems that naming this property non-aborting would be more appropriate: in total correctness, non-termination is abortion, whereas in partial correctness, it is not. Conjunctive A predicate transformer T is conjunctive iff: This is the case for , even if statement S is non-deterministic as a selection statement or a specification statement.

Document 3 (Title: Aspirin exacerbated respiratory disease): In addition to aspirin, patients also react to other NSAIDs such as ibuprofen, and to any medication that inhibits the cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) enzyme, although paracetamol (acetaminophen) in low doses is generally considered safe. NSAIDs that are highly selective in blocking COX-2 and do not block its closely related paralog, COX-1, such as the COX-2 inhibitors celecoxib and rofecoxib, also are regarded as safe. Nonetheless, recent studies do find that these types of drugs, e.g. acetaminophen and celecoxib, may trigger adverse reactions in these patients; caution is recommended in using any COX inhibitors. In addition to aspirin and NSAIDs, consumption of even small amounts of alcohol also produces uncomfortable respiratory reactions in many patients.
Document 4 (Title: University of Medicine 1, Yangon): At the end of the 1st MB course, the student should be able to: Define and understand ethics, medical ethics, Hippocratic Oath, Declaration of Geneva in Burmese and English versions Be aware of ethical and moral issues in relation to Burmese culture At the end of the 2nd MB course, the student should be able to: Choose correct statement regarding respect of dead body and specimen. Choose correct statement regarding research ethics Choose correct statement regarding informed consent At the end of the 3rd MB course, the student should be able to: Be aware of biomedical ethics Safely handle infectious agents Describe rational prescribing (NNT, RRR, APR) Prescribe safely Conduct appropriate bedside manner Identify health care errors and their causes At the end of the FP I course, the student should be able to describe: code of conduct (medical/ethical) serious medical misconduct medical negligence (civil and criminal) formation and function of MMC professionalism
Document 5 (Title: Lacunar stroke): Treatment and prognosis Typically, tissue plasminogen activator may be administered within 3 to 4.5 hours of stroke onset if the patient is without contraindications (i.e. a bleeding diathesis such as recent major surgery or cancer with brain metastases). High dose aspirin can be given within 48 hours. For long term prevention of recurrence, medical regimens are typically aimed towards correcting the underlying risk factors for lacunar infarcts such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus and cigarette smoking. Anticoagulants such as heparin and warfarin have shown no benefit over aspirin with regards to five-year survival. Patients who suffer lacunar strokes have a greater chance of surviving beyond thirty days (96%) than those with other types of stroke (85%), and better survival beyond a year (87% versus 65-70%). Between 70% and 80% are functionally independent at 1 year, compared with fewer than 50% otherwise.

Answer the following list question.
Question: Select the correct statement(s) regarding aspirin:
Options:
1. The prolongation of bleeding time by taking aspirin lasts only for 6 hours
2. The anti-aggregating action on platelets is linked to inhibition of glycoprotein IIb-IIIa
3. Aspirin has proven its effectiveness in preventing recurrences of myocardial infarction
4. Aspirin potentiates the anticoagulant action of vitamin K antagonists
5. The usual anti-platelet aggregation dose of aspirin is less than 500 mg/24 hours
