Document 1 (Title: Digital subtraction angiography): IV-DSA has also been useful in assessing patients prior to surgery and after coronary artery bypass surgery and some transplant operations. Applications DSA is primarily used to image blood vessels. It is useful in the diagnosis and treatment of arterial and venous occlusions, including carotid artery stenosis, pulmonary embolisms, and acute limb ischaemia; arterial stenosis, which is particularly useful for potential kidney donors in detecting renal artery stenosis (DSA is the gold standard investigation for renal artery stenosis); cerebral aneurysms and arteriovenous malformations (AVM). The future DSA is done less and less routinely in imaging departments. It is being replaced by computed tomography angiography (CTA), which can produce 3D images through a test which is less invasive and stressful for the patient, and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), which avoids X-rays and nephrotoxic contrast agents.
Document 2 (Title: Carotid artery stenosis): Screening The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends against routine screening for carotid artery stenosis in those without symptoms as of 2021. While routine population screening is not advised, the American Heart Association and the Society for Vascular Surgery recommend screening in those diagnosed with related medical conditions or have risk factors for carotid artery disease. Screening is recommended for people who have: Vascular disease elsewhere in the body, including: Peripheral artery disease (PAD) Coronary artery disease (CAD) Atherosclerotic aortic aneurysm (AAA) Two or more of the following risk factors: High blood pressure (hypertension) High cholesterol (hyperlipidemia) Tobacco smoking Family history – First-degree relative diagnosed with atherosclerosis before age 60 or who suffered an ischemic stroke
Document 3 (Title: Outline of cardiology): Coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG): Grafting an artery or vein from elsewhere to bypass a stenotic coronary artery. Performed by cardiothoracic surgeons, a sternotomy is performed to open the chest and then grafts are performed. Cardiopulmonary bypass may be necessary. The internal mammary artery or saphenous vein can be used as grafts. The grafts are used to provide an alternate path for blood flow around a stenosis. Enhanced external counterpulsation (EECP): Pneumatically assisting the heart to move blood using inflatable cuffs on the legs. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) – Procedures to treat stenotic coronary arteries by accessing through a blood vessel. Angioplasty in this manner is PTCA (described below) but may also involve the insertion of stents to keep vessels open.
Document 4 (Title: Intravascular ultrasound): Intravascular ultrasound in the coronary anatomy While the routine use of IVUS during percutaneous coronary intervention does not improve short term outcomes, there are a number of situations in which IVUS is of particular use in the treatment of coronary artery disease of the heart. In particular in cases when the degree of stenosis of a coronary artery is unclear, IVUS can directly quantify the percentage of stenosis and give insight into the anatomy of the plaque. One particular use of IVUS in the coronary anatomy is in the quantification of left main disease in cases where routine coronary angiography gives equivocal results. Many studies in the past have shown that significant left main disease can increase mortality, and that intervention (either coronary artery bypass graft surgery or percutaneous coronary intervention) to reduce mortality is necessary when the left main stenosis is significant.
Document 5 (Title: Digital subtraction angiography): Some limited studies have indicated that IV-DSA is not suitable for patients with diabetes or kidney failure because the dye load is significantly higher than that used in arteriography. However, IV-DSA has been used successfully to study the vessels of the brain and heart and has helped detect carotid artery obstruction and to map patterns of cerebral blood flow. It also helps detect and diagnose lesions in the carotid arteries, a potential cause of strokes. IV-DSA has also been useful in assessing patients prior to surgery and after coronary artery bypass surgery and some transplant operations.
