        "title": "[Evolution and treatment of 8 patients with Fournier's perineal-scrotal gangrene].",
        "content": "The authors present eight cases of Fournier's gangrene treated from 1987 to 1989 (3 years). There was no discernable cause for 5 patients (62.5%). Immediate aggressive surgical debridement of all necrotic tissue was performed. Intravenous antibiotics and resuscitation fluid and hyperbaric oxygenation were also administered to all patients. Skin grafting was performed for 4 patients (40%), 3 weeks after surgical debridement. One patient died (12.5%) and 2 subsequently developed an urethral stricture. Etiology, treatment and outcome of Fournier's gangrene are discussed and the results of the study are compared to other studies. This disease is still serious, its pathogenesis is not completely elucidated, but when immediate adequate treatment is performed, the outcome is generally favourable.",

        "content": "Two cases of Fournier's gangrene in which toxemia and gangrene of the scrotum developed due to perianal abscesses are described. Cultures of anaerobic gram-negative Bacteroides with a mixed flora of Pseudomonas, E. coli and Proteus were obtained. Early diagnosis, wide and deep incisions, debridement of the necrotic tissue, and adequate antibiotic therapy can prevent a fatal outcome of this disease. A high mortality rate is still prevalent.",

        "content": "Fournier's gangrene is defined classically as a fulminant, rapidly spreading infection of the scrotum that also involves the perineum, penis and abdominal wall. The pathologic findings are described as synergistic gangrene secondary to a polymicrobial flora with a poorly defined portal of entry. We report 3 cases of Fournier's gangrene. Case 1 was a 67 years old who was admitted with the chief complaint of scrotal swelling and necrosis. Case 2 was a 59 years old who was admitted with the problem of scrotal swelling and pain, he had sought other medical help without success, and was then transferred to our hospital. Case 3 was a 62 years old who was admitted with the chief complaint of scrotal swelling and pain for 2 days. These 3 patients were all found to have diabetes mellitus. All 3 patients required aggressive surgical debridement, broad-spectrum antibiotics and adjunctive measures. Blood cultures were usually negative and pus cultures were typically aerobic gram-negative rods and gram-positive cocci and anaerobic bacteria of various types, especially Bacteroids fragilis. Our pus cultures revealed Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus in Case 1, Enterobacter cloacae in Case 2 and E. coli, B. fragilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in Case 3. This disease is no longer a disease of young men. After 1945, the average age in 119 reported cases was 51.3 years and the average age of our cases was 62.7 years. Before the era of antibiotics, scrotal gangrene was not a rarity. In these modern times, in spite of seeking medical attention early, patients still developed scrotal gangrene and the mortality rate is high.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "content": "A case is described in which Fournier's gangrene was the presenting feature of diabetes mellitus and in which extensive subcutaneous emphysema prevented the use of spinal anaesthesia for debridement. In the literature four cases have been reported in which Fournier's gangrene was the presenting feature in patients with diabetic ketoacidosis. Diabetes may predispose to a form of Fournier's gangrene in which subcutaneous gas formation is marked, though subcutaneous emphysema to the degree described in this case has not previously been reported in this condition. Diabetes mellitus and subcutaneous emphysema must be sought in patients with Fournier's gangrene as both may have a profound influence on management.",
