        "content": "Subclinical Subclinical hypothyroidism is a milder form of hypothyroidism characterized by an elevated serum TSH level, but with a normal serum free thyroxine level. This milder form of hypothyroidism is most commonly caused by Hashimoto's thyroiditis. In adults it is diagnosed when TSH levels are greater than 5 mIU/L and less than 10mIU/L. The presentation of subclinical hypothyroidism is variable and classic signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism may not be observed. Of people with subclinical hypothyroidism, a proportion will develop overt hypothyroidism each year. In those with detectable antibodies against thyroid peroxidase (TPO), this occurs in 4.3%, while in those with no detectable antibodies, this occurs in 2.6%. Those with subclinical hypothyroidism and detectable anti-TPO antibodies who do not require treatment should have repeat thyroid function tests more frequently (e.g. yearly) compared with those who do not have antibodies.",

        "content": "The first cases of myxedema were recognized in the mid-19th century (the 1870s), but its connection to the thyroid was not discovered until the 1880s when myxedema was observed in people following the removal of the thyroid gland (thyroidectomy). The link was further confirmed in the late 19th century when people and animals who had had their thyroid removed showed improvement in symptoms with transplantation of animal thyroid tissue. The severity of myxedema, and its associated risk of mortality and complications, created interest in discovering effective treatments for hypothyroidism. Transplantation of thyroid tissue demonstrated some efficacy, but recurrences of hypothyroidism was relatively common, and sometimes required multiple repeat transplantations of thyroid tissue.",

Myxedema coma Myxedema coma is a rare but life-threatening state of extreme hypothyroidism. It may occur in those with established hypothyroidism when they develop an acute illness. Myxedema coma can be the first presentation of hypothyroidism. People with myxedema coma typically have a low body temperature without shivering, confusion, a slow heart rate and reduced breathing effort. There may be physical signs suggestive of hypothyroidism, such as skin changes or enlargement of the tongue. Pregnancy",

        "content": "Subclinical hypothyroidism is an example of the impact of technology on the concept of a disease. It denotes a condition in which laboratory findings, at least including a raised serum thyrotropin (s-TSH), indicate hypothyroidism in the absence of clinical signs or symptoms of this disease. One reason for attention to cases of subclinical hypothyroidism is the publication of reports, from the time before introduction of the s-TSH assay, that hypercholesterolaemia precedes other evidence of thyroid failure with attendant risks of ischaemic heart disease and other atherosclerotic manifestations. The present investigation, which concerned the lipid pattern in sublinical hypothyroiism, offered no support for such a concept of hypercholesterolaemia as a premonitory sign of hypothyroidism. Furthermore, no significant differences were found between the serum levels of cholesterol and triglycerides before and after the administration of a thyroxine dose, necessary to suppress the s-TSH into a normal range, in cases of sublinical hypothyroidism. Nor were there any changes during this therapy in body weight, ECG, or Hb levels, which represent important parameters often found to be abnormal in overt hypothyroidism. From a practical point of view, subclinical hypothyroidism probably can be regarded as a state in which reduction of thyroid activity has been compensated by an increased s-TSH secretion to maintain a clinically euthyroid state. When no goitre is found, the rationale of treatment of this condition remains to be proved.",
