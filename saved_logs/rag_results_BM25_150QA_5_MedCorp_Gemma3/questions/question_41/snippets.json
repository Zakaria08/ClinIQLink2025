        "content": "History of Present Illness: A 33-year-old\u00a0white female presents after admission to the general medical/surgical hospital ward with a chief complaint of shortness of breath on exertion. She reports that she was seen for similar symptoms previously at her primary care physician\u2019s office six months ago.\u00a0At that time, she was diagnosed with acute bronchitis and treated with bronchodilators, empiric antibiotics, and a short course oral steroid taper. This management did not improve her symptoms, and she has gradually worsened over six months. She reports a 20-pound (9 kg) intentional weight loss over the past year. She denies camping, spelunking, or hunting activities. She denies any sick contacts. A brief review of systems is negative for fever, night sweats, palpitations, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, neural sensation changes, muscular changes, and increased bruising or bleeding. She admits a cough, shortness of breath, and shortness of breath on exertion.",

        "content": "A 78-year-old woman with exertional dyspnea (Hugh-Jones Grade III) and dry cough was admitted to our hospital in April, 1983. She had marked cardiac cachexia and a loss of body weight due to long term heart failure. On physical examination a systolic ejection murmur and a diastolic rumbling murmur were heard without the opening snap sound. Chest radiography revealed pleural effusion and cardiomegaly. M-mode and two dimensional echocardiography demonstrated abnormal echoes in the left atrium, the density being 22.7 Hounsfield Unit. Radionuclide angiography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provided similar findings. No other mass lesion existed in the other chambers. Based on these findings, the mass was diagnosed as a left atrial myxoma. She has been well except for periodic congestive heart failure, for about five years since her discharge. The course of her ailment is interesting because her treatment is mainly symptomatic.",
