Document 1 (Title: HBsAg): Positive HBsAg tests can be due to recent vaccination against Hepatitis B virus but this positivity is unlikely to persist beyond 14 days post-vaccination. History It is commonly referred to as the Australia Antigen. This is because it was first isolated by the American research physician and Nobel Prize winner Baruch S. Blumberg in the serum of an Australian Aboriginal person. It was discovered to be part of the virus that caused serum hepatitis by virologist Alfred Prince in 1968. Heptavax, a "first-generation" hepatitis B vaccine in the 1980s, was made from HBsAg extracted from the blood plasma of hepatitis patients. Current vaccine are made from recombinant HBsAg grown in yeast. See also HBcAg HBeAg References Viral structural proteins Hepatitis B virus Antigens

Document 3 (Title: Viral hepatitis): Hepatitis C is the most common chronic blood-borne infection in the United States. Hepatitis D Hepatitis D is caused by the hepatitis D virus (HDV), or hepatitis delta virus; it belongs to the genus Deltavirus. It is similar to a satellite virus as it can only propagate in the presence of the hepatitis B virus, depending on the helper function of HBV for its replication and expression. It has no independent life cycle, but can survive and replicate as long as HBV infection persists in the host body. It can only cause infection when encapsulated by hepatitis B virus surface antigens. The vaccine for hepatitis B protects against hepatitis D virus because of the latter's dependence on the presence of hepatitis B virus for it to replicate. Hepatitis E
Document 4 (Title: Hepatology): Baruch S. Blumberg discovered hepatitis B virus in 1966 and developed the first vaccine against it 1969. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1976. In 1989, investigators from the CDC (Daniel W. Bradley) and Chiron (Michael Houghton) identified the hepatitis C virus, which had previously been known as non-A, non-B hepatitis and could not be detected in the blood supply. Only in 1992 was a blood test created that could detect hepatitis C in donated blood.
Document 5 (Title: Duck hepatitis B virus): Duck hepatitis B virus, abbreviated DHBV, is part of the genus Avihepadnavirus of the Hepadnaviridae, and is the causal agent of duck hepatitis B. DHBV is a small DNA virus with a diameter of 40–45 nm. The viral envelope is made up from host cell lipid, with viral surface antigens (DHBsAg). The icosahedral nucleocapsid within, is composed of the virus core antigen (DHBcAg) and surrounds the DNA genome and viral polymerase. The viral genome is a circular double stranded DNA molecule about 3000 base pairs long. The genome has three overlapping open reading frames or ORFs: C-ORF – encoding the core antigen and pre-core protein which are processed and secreted as DHBcAg S-ORF – codes for the surface antigen DHBsAg P-ORF – encoding the viral polymerase. On binding and entry of the virus to the host cell, the genome is transported to the nucleus to be transcribed. Novel viral RNA is then transferred to the cytoplasm for translation and subsequent protein synthesis.
