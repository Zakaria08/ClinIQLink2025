With your own knowledge and the help of the following document:

Document 1 (Title: Bence Jones protein): Bence Jones protein is a monoclonal globulin protein or immunoglobulin light chain found in the urine, with a molecular weight of 22–24 kDa. Detection of Bence Jones protein may be suggestive of multiple myeloma or Waldenström's macroglobulinemia. Bence Jones proteins are particularly diagnostic of multiple myeloma in the context of target organ manifestations such as kidney failure, lytic (or "punched out") bone lesions, anemia, or large numbers of plasma cells in the bone marrow of patients. Bence Jones proteins are present in 2/3 of multiple myeloma cases.
Document 2 (Title: Bence-Jones Protein -- Normal and Critical Findings): Quantitation of Bence Jones proteins occurs through electrophoresis and densitometry. Laboratory analysis of urine can identify Bence Jones proteins at a threshold of 10 mg/L. However, it is important to note that detection limits for Bence Jones proteins can only be approximate. The presence of Bence Jones proteins in the urine is usually considered abnormal and should raise suspicion for multiple myeloma or other plasma cell disorders. [6]
Document 3 (Title: Refolding of the immunoglobulin light chain.): The kinetics of the refolding reactions of type lambda Bence Jones proteins from 4 M GuHCl were studied by CD, ultraviolet absorption, and fluorescence spectrophotometry. The kinetics were complex and consisted of at least three phases, an undetectable fast phase, a detectable fast phase, and a slow phase. The slow phase followed first-order kinetics and the three experimental methods used gave similar rate constants for all the Bence Jones proteins (about 3 X 10(-3) s-1). The refolding reaction of VL fragment was too fast to be measured in the present experiments. The refolding process of CL fragment was very similar to those of Bence Jones proteins except that the detectable fast phase was less significant. The rate constant of the slow phase observed for the CL fragment was similar to those of the slow phase observed for Bence Jones proteins. The activation energy of the slow phase was the same for a Bence Jones protein and its CL fragment. These results indicate that the refolding kinetics of the CL domain are very similar to those of isolated CL fragment and that refolding of the VL domain precedes refolding of the CL domain, even though both domains have similar immunoglobulin folds. However, the results of refolding experiments on Bence Jones proteins, and VL and CL fragments in the presence of ANS, as well as the other lines of evidence, indicate that the refolding kinetics of the Bence Jones protein molecule cannot be expressed as simple sum of the refolding reactions of isolated VL and CL fragments.
Document 4 (Title: Ionization and reactivities of the thiol groups which participate in the formation of interchain disulfide bonds of Bence Jones proteins and an Fab(t) fragment.): The pK values and reactivities of the thiol groups which participate in the formation of interchain disulfide bonds in Bence Jones proteins and the Fab(t) fragment of a myeloma protein (Jo) (IgGl, kappa) were determined by means of the reactions with chloroacetamide and DTNB, and of spectrophotometric titration. The two thiol groups of partially reduced type kappa Bence Jones protein dimers had the same pK values (pK = 9.76 at 0.2 ionic strength and 25 degrees C) and the same true second-order rate constants (k) toward chloroacetamide (k = 18.8 x 10(-2) M-1 . S-1). The two thiol groups of partially reduced type lambda Bence Jones protein dimers had different pK values but the variation of the pK values among the specimens was small (pK1 = 8.5-8.6 and pK2 = 9.5-9.7 at 0.2 ionic strength and 25 degrees C). The spectrophotometric titration of partially reduced Nag protein (type lambda) also showed that the two thiol groups have different pK values. The pK values of two thiol groups of the partially reduced Fab(t) fragment were determined as 8.51 and 9.76 at 0.2 ionic strength and 25 degrees C. The effect of ionic strength on the pK values of the thiol groups of partially reduced Nag protein and the pK values of the thiol groups in partially reduced Ta protein (type kappa) and in a hybrid molecule formed between partially reduced Ta protein and partially reduced and alkylated H chains indicated that the difference in pK values did not arise from electrostatic interaction between the two thiol groups, but that the pK values are intrinsically different. The true rate constants, k1 and k2, of the two thiol groups of type lambda Bence Jones proteins varied with the specimen (k1 = 1.9-5.7 x 10(-2) M-1 . S-1 and k2 = 18.5-25.0 x 10(-2) M-1 . S-1). The k1 and k2 values for Jo-Fab(t) were 7.21 x 10(-2) and 23.1 x 10(-2) M-1 . S-1, respectively. On the basis of these pK values and reactivities, we discuss the reformation of the interchain disulfide bonds from partially reduced Bence Jones proteins and immunoglobulins in the presence of oxidized glutathione.
