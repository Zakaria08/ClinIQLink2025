Document 1 (Title: Diethylene glycol): At first, scientists thought that DEG metabolized into ethylene glycol, which is poisonous due to the metabolic production of glycolic acid, glyoxylic acid, and ultimately oxalic acid. The major cause of ethylene glycol toxicity is the accumulation of glycolic acid in the body, but the accumulation of calcium oxalate crystals in the kidneys can also lead to acute kidney failure. In the case of DEG, observations demonstrated there were no calcium oxalate crystal deposits in the kidneys, implying ethylene glycol is not on the DEG metabolic pathway. Rat models suggest DEG is metabolized in the liver by enzyme NAD-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) into a hydrogen ion, NADH and 2-hydroxyethoxyacetaldehyde (C4H8O3). Shortly after, 2-hydroxyethoxyacetaldehyde (C4H8O3) is metabolized by the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) into the weak acid 2-hydroxyethoxyacetic acid (HEAA) with chemical formula C4H8O4. Later on, HEAA leaves the liver through the bloodstream, being partially filtered
Document 2 (Title: Ethylene oxide): Ethylene oxide causes acute poisoning, accompanied by a variety of symptoms. Central nervous system effects are frequently associated with human exposure to ethylene oxide in occupational settings. Headache, nausea, and vomiting have been reported. Peripheral neuropathy, impaired hand-eye coordination and memory loss have been reported in more recent case studies of chronically-exposed workers at estimated average exposure levels as low as 3 ppm (with possible short-term peaks as high as 700ppm). The metabolism of ethylene oxide is not completely known. Data from animal studies indicate two possible pathways for the metabolism of ethylene oxide: hydrolysis to ethylene glycol and glutathione conjugation to form mercapturic acid and meththio-metabolites. Ethylene oxide easily penetrates through ordinary clothing and footwear, causing skin irritation and dermatitis with the formation of blisters, fever and leukocytosis.
Document 3 (Title: Diethylene glycol): Diethylene glycol has moderate acute toxicity in animal experiments. The LD50 for small mammals has been tested at between 2 and 25 g/kg, less toxic than its relative ethylene glycol, but still capable of causing toxicity in humans. It appears diethylene glycol is more hazardous to humans than implied by oral toxicity data in laboratory animals. Toxicokinetics Although there is limited information about toxicokinetics in humans, observations in mass poisonings and experimental studies suggest the following information: Absorption and distribution The principal method of absorption is through oral ingestion. Dermal absorption is very low, unless it is administered on broken or damaged skin. After ingestion, DEG is absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract and distributed by the bloodstream throughout the body, reaching peak blood concentrations within 30 to 120 minutes. Once DEG reaches the liver, it is metabolized by enzymes.
Document 4 (Title: Blacklight): Fungal and bacterial infections It is also helpful in diagnosing: Fungal infections. Some forms of tinea, such as Trichophyton tonsurans, do not fluoresce. Bacterial infections Corynebacterium minutissimum is coral red Pseudomonas is yellow-green Cutibacterium acnes, a bacterium involved in acne causation, exhibits an orange glow under a Wood's lamp. Ethylene glycol poisoning A Wood's lamp may be used to rapidly assess whether an individual is suffering from ethylene glycol poisoning as a consequence of antifreeze ingestion. Manufacturers of ethylene glycol-containing antifreezes commonly add fluorescein, which causes the patient's urine to fluoresce under Wood's lamp.
Document 5 (Title: Alcohol dehydrogenase): Drug dependence Drug dependence is another problem associated with ADH, which researchers think might be linked to alcoholism. One particular study suggests that drug dependence has seven ADH genes associated with it, however, more research is necessary. Alcohol dependence and other drug dependence may share some risk factors, but because alcohol dependence is often comorbid with other drug dependences, the association of ADH with the other drug dependencies may not be causal. Poisoning Fomepizole, a drug that competitively inhibits alcohol dehydrogenase, can be used in the setting of acute methanol or ethylene glycol toxicity. This prevents the conversion of the methanol or ethylene glycol to its toxic metabolites (such as formic acid, formaldehyde, or glycolate). The same effect is also sometimes achieved with ethanol, again by competitive inhibition of ADH.
