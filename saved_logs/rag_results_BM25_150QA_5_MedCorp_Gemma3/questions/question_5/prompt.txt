With your own knowledge and the help of the following document:

Document 1 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): Her social history is significant for alcohol use (three to four glasses of wine/night). Her vital signs include the following: temperature 99.8°F, blood pressure 132/64 mm Hg, pulse 78 bpm, and respiratory rate 15/min. On physical examination, she had left upper abdominal tenderness with evidence of hepatomegaly and mild scleral icterus. Laboratory data revealed the following: alanine aminotransferase, 527 IU/L (normal 10–35 IU/L); aspartate aminotransferase, 425 IU/L (normal < 35 IU/L); and bilirubin, 2.9 mg/dL (normal 0.1–0.3 mg/dL). What medications do OTC cold and flu preparations typically contain? Which of the OTC medications might have contrib-uted to the patient’s current symptoms? KH, a 55-year-old woman, presents to the emergency department with nausea, vomiting, and complaints of new-onset flu symptoms over the past several days. Her past medical history is significant for allergic rhinitis and chronic lower back pain secondary to a work-related fall 2 years ago. Her
Document 2 (Title: [A case report of a 63-year-old patient with malignant hyperthermia].): We have experienced a case of fulminant malignant hyperthermia who was a 63-year-old female weighing 44 kg. There was no particular past history nor family history. She underwent right mastoidectomy because of chronic otitis media. Her preoperative physical status was ASA I. She was premedicated with diazepam 10 mg and loxatigine 75 mg P.O. The induction was done with thiamylal 200 mg IV and fentanyl 0.1 mg IV followed by vecuronium 6 mg IV for endotracheal intubation. Intubation was easy and uneventful. Anesthesia was maintained with nitrous oxide 3 l.min-1, oxygen 3 l.min-1 and enflurane 2.0%. Seventy min after the induction of anesthesia, arterial blood gas analysis showed severe respiratory acidosis (PCO2: 63.2 mmHg, pH: 7.27) and it was improved with manual hyperventilation at that time. Pulse rate increased from 80 to 115 b.p.m. 20 minutes later. Then, the patient was ventilated with 100% oxygen, and anesthetic circuits and machine were exchanged for new units. Surgery was postponed. Muscle stiffness of upper extremities was observed and her temperature increased to a maximum of 38.9 degrees C. Surface cooling was started and dantrolene sodium 60 mg and furosemide 20 mg were given intravenously. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit, and clinical signs improved gradually within one hour. Serum enzymes; CPK, LDH, GOT and GPT increased on the first postoperative day. On the 11 th postoperative day skeletal muscle biopsy was done under local anesthesia with 1% procaine and Ca-induced Ca-release rate test revealed positive for enflurane. This is the oldest patient of malignant hyperthermia reported in Japan.
Document 3 (Title: Infection in the diabetic foot.): A 56-year-old woman presented with a chronic infection of her right first toe. The woman had a 15-year history of diabetes mellitus and had been insulin dependent for the past five years. Her toe had been injured one month earlier when hit by a frozen chicken that fell out of the freezer. The accident caused a bruise and a small cut. Serous to purulent drainage then developed. When she presented, the toe was reddened and draining. Physical examination showed a nonobese woman with no fever or other evidence of systemic infection. The wound showed no evidence of necrotizing fasciitis. Peripheral pulses were 2+ and capillary refill was slow. Sensation in both feet was decreased. The transcutaneous oxygen tension in the feet was reduced at 20 mm Hg. Relevant laboratory findings included a serum glucose of 250 and creatinine of 1.5. X-rays of the foot were compatible with diffuse osteomyelitis of the distal phalanx of the great toe. Technetium and indium scans were positive, with increased uptake localized to the area of x-ray changes (Figure 1). The patient was admitted to the hospital.
Document 4 (Title: [A case of miliary tuberculosis associated with acute respiratory failure during pregnancy].): A case of miliary tuberculosis associated with acute respiratory failure during pregnancy was reported. A 39-year-old, 29-week pregnant woman was admitted to our hospital with complaints of nonproductive cough and fever on June 12. On admission, her temperature was 38.2 degrees C; pulse rate was 90/min., and blood pressure was 120/76 mmHg. Physical examination revealed moist rales at right lung basis. Chest X-ray showed small nodular infiltrates in right lower lung field. Laboratory data revealed positive CRP, accelerated ESR and increased level of alpha 2-globulin. The number of T-cells was markedly decreased (14/mm3). The PPD skin test was negative, and the sputum smears for acid-fast bacilli were negative. Suspected of bacterial or viral pneumonia, the patient was treated with antibiotics (CPM, EM and CAZ), which had no effects for her. On June 16, the Chest X-ray showed infiltrates throughout bilateral lung fields, and the patient became increasingly dyspneic. On June 18, the results of arterial blood gas, analysis under room air were: PaO2 26.7 Torr, PaCO2 29.0 Torr, pH 7.505. Because of severe hypoxemia, she was intubated and placed on a volume-cycled respirator. Hydrocortisone (1000 mg, daily) was added to treatment because ARDS was suspected. Since the smears of tracheobronchial secretions showed acid-fast bacilli on June 24, she was diagnosed to have miliary tuberculosis. Then the intensive therapy with antituberculosis drugs (isoniazid 400 mg, rifampicin 450 mg, and streptomycin 1g, daily) was started. The non specific antibiotics were discontinued; hydrocortisone was tapered and stopped. The next week, she became afebrile and hypoxemia steadily improved.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Document 5 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): James L. Zehnder, MD and edema and is tender to touch. Oxygen saturation by fingertip pulse oximeter while breathing room air is 87% (normal > 90%). Ultrasound reveals a deep vein thrombosis in the left lower extremity; chest computed tomography scan confirms the presence of pulmonary emboli. Laboratory blood tests indicate elevated d-dimer levels. What therapy is indicated acutely? What are the long-term therapy options? How long should she be treated? Should this indi-vidual use oral contraceptives? A 25-year-old woman presents to the emergency depart-ment complaining of acute onset of shortness of breath and pleuritic pain. She had been in her usual state of health until 2 days prior when she noted that her left leg was swollen and red. Her only medication was oral contraceptives. Family history was significant for a history of “blood clots” in mul-tiple members of the maternal side of her family. Physical examination demonstrates an anxious woman with stable vital signs.

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
Question: A 20-year-old woman presents with menorrhagia for the past several years. She says that her menses “have always been heavy”, and she has experienced easy bruising for as long as she can remember. Family history is significant for her mother, who had similar problems with bruising easily. The patient's vital signs include: heart rate 98/min, respiratory rate 14/min, temperature 36.1°C (96.9°F), and blood pressure 110/87 mm Hg. Physical examination is unremarkable.

Options:
A. Hemophilia A
B. Lupus anticoagulant
