Document 1 (Title: Plasmodium ovale): These species appear to be more closely related to Plasmodium malariae than to Plasmodium vivax. The two species appear to differ in their biology with P. ovale wallikeri having a shorter latency period than P. ovale curtisi. Life cycle P. ovale is introduced into the human host by the bite of an infected mosquito, in a motile form called a sporozoite. The sporozoites are carried by the blood to the liver, where they replicate asexually by merogony into non-motile merozoites. Several hundred merozoites are produced and released into the blood stream where they infect erythrocytes. Inside the erythrocyte, the parasite's replication cycle takes approximately 49 hours, after which the erythrocyte ruptures and between 8 and 20 merozoites are released to infect other erythrocytes. Some of these merozoites will instead form gametocytes which remain in the blood and are ingested by a mosquito.
Document 2 (Title: Plasmodium eylesi): Plasmodium eylesi is a parasite of the genus Plasmodium subgenus Plasmodium. Like all Plasmodium species P. eylesi has both vertebrate and insect hosts. The vertebrate hosts for this parasite are mammals. Description The parasite was first described by Warren et al. in 1965. and is named after the malariologist Dr. Don E. Eyles, Father of the Apollo computer engineer Don Eyles. It is believed that this species is related to Plasmodium hylobati, Plasmodium jefferyi and Plasmodium youngi but this putative relationship awaits examination by DNA based methods. The parasite prefers to infect reticulocytes but will infect older erythrocytes. Multiple infections like those of Plasmodium falciparum are common with up to six ring forms. Almost immediately on infection the erythrocyte enlarges. Schüffner's dots are rapidly apparent. Pigment is scarce, granular and yellowish-brown.
Document 3 (Title: CD36): Infections with the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum are characterized by sequestration of erythrocytes infected with mature forms of the parasite and CD36 has been shown to be a major sequestration receptor on microvascular endothelial cells. Parasitised erythrocytes adhere to endothelium at the trophozoite/schizonts stage simultaneous with the appearance of the var gene product (erythrocyte membrane protein 1) on the erythrocyte surface. The appearance of Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) on the erythrocyte surface is a temperature dependent phenomenon which is due to increased protein trafficking to the erythrocyte surface at the raised temperature. PfEMP1 can bind other endothelial receptors - thrombospondin (TSP) and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) – in addition to CD36 - and genes other than PfEMP1 also bind to CD36: cytoadherence linked protein (clag) and sequestrin. The PfEMP1 binding site on CD36 is known to be located on
Document 4 (Title: Plasmodium ashfordi): Plasmodium ashfordi is a species of the genus Plasmodium subgenus Papernaia. Like all species in this genus it has both vertebrate and insect hosts. The vertebrate host are birds. Description This species was first described in 2007 by Valkiunas et al. The parasite infects erythrocytes. The influence of trophozoites on the morphology of infected erythrocytes is not marked. The parasite nucleus is small, usually terminal in position or with chromatin concentrated along the outer periphery of trophozoites. One or two small (<1 µm in diameter) vacuoles are frequently present in the cytoplasm. Ring forms are not characteristic.
Document 5 (Title: Plasmodium): The life cycle of Plasmodium involves several distinct stages in the insect and vertebrate hosts. Parasites are generally introduced into a vertebrate host by the bite of an insect host (generally a mosquito, with the exception of some Plasmodium species of reptiles). Parasites first infect the liver or other tissue, where they undergo a single large round of replication before exiting the host cell to infect erythrocytes. At this point, some species of Plasmodium of primates can form a long-lived dormant stage called a hypnozoite. It can remain in the liver for more than a year. However, for most Plasmodium species, the parasites in infected liver cells are only what are called merozoites. After emerging from the liver, they enter red blood cells, as explained above. They then go through continuous cycles of erythrocyte infection, while a small percentage of parasites differentiate into a sexual stage called a gametocyte which is picked up by an insect host taking a blood meal.
