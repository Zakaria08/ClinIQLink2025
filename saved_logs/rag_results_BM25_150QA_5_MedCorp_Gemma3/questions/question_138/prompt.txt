Document 1 (Title: Histocompatibility): Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) HLA, the human form of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), is located on chromosome 6 at 6p21.3. Individuals inherit two different HLA haplotypes, one from each parent, each containing more than 200 genes relevant to helping the immune system recognize foreign invaders. These genes include MHC class I and class II cell-surface proteins. MHC Class I molecules—HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C—are present on all nucleated cells and are responsible for signaling to an immune cell that an antigen is inside the cell. MHC Class II molecules—HLA-DR, and HLA-DQ and HLA-DP—are only present on antigen presenting cells and are responsible for presenting molecules from invading organisms to cells of the immune system.
Document 2 (Title: Minor histocompatibility antigen): The recognition of a mature T cell to this self antigen should not induce an immune response. During thymic selection occurring in the thymus, only a thymocyte TCR that recognizes either class I or class II MHC molecule plus peptide should survive positive selection. However, there is death by apoptosis of thymocytes that do not interact with MHC molecules or have high-affinity receptors for self MHC plus self antigen a process referred to as negative selection. Therefore, the process of positive and negative selection means fewer self-reactive mature T cells will leave the thymus and lead to autoimmune problems. Discovery of MiHAs
Document 3 (Title: Major histocompatibility complex, class II, DQ alpha 1): Major histocompatibility complex, class II, DQ alpha 1, also known as HLA-DQA1, is a human gene present on short arm of chromosome 6 (6p21.3) and also denotes the genetic locus which contains this gene. The protein encoded by this gene is one of two proteins that are required to form the DQ heterodimer, a cell surface receptor essential to the function of the immune system. Function HLA-DQA1 belongs to the HLA class II alpha chain paralogues. This class II molecule is a heterodimer consisting of an alpha (DQA) and a beta chain (DQB), both anchored in the membrane. It plays a central role in the immune system by presenting peptides derived from extracellular proteins. Class II molecules are expressed in antigen-presenting cells (APC: B lymphocytes, dendritic cells, macrophages).
Document 4 (Title: Major histocompatibility complex): MHC class II molecules in humans have five to six isotypes. Classical molecules present peptides to CD4+ lymphocytes. Nonclassical molecules, accessories, with intracellular functions, are not exposed on cell membranes, but in internal membranes, assisting with the loading of antigenic peptides onto classic MHC class II molecules. The important nonclassical MHC class II molecule DM is only found from the evolutionary level of lungfish, although also in more primitive fishes both classical and nonclassical MHC class II are found. MHC class III Class III molecules have physiologic roles unlike classes I and II, but are encoded between them in the short arm of human chromosome 6. Class III molecules include several secreted proteins with immune functions: components of the complement system (such as C2, C4, and B factor), cytokines (such as TNF-α, LTA, and LTB), and heat shock proteins.
Document 5 (Title: HLA-DO): Human leukocyte histocompatibility complex DO (HLA-DO) is an intracellular, dimeric non-classical Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class II protein composed of α- and β-subunits which interact with HLA-DM in order to fine tune immunodominant epitope selection. As a non-classical MHC class II molecule, HLA-DO is a non-polymorphic accessory protein that aids in antigenic peptide chaperoning and loading, as opposed to its classical counterparts, which are polymorphic and involved in antigen presentation. Though more remains to be elucidated about the function of HLA-DO, its unique distribution in the mammalian body—namely, the exclusive expression of HLA-DO in B cells, thymic medullary epithelial cells, and dendritic cells—indicate that it may be of physiological importance and has inspired further research. Although HLA-DM can be found without HLA-DO, HLA-DO is only found in complex with HLA-DM and exhibits instability in the absence of HLA-DM. The evolutionary conservation of both
