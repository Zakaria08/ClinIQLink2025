        "content": "To increase quality life following ASD procedures/surgeries, patients should have a physical exam and ECG every 3, 6, and 12 months with their cardiologist. For many patients with secundum ASD closure repair, they can return to their normal activities unless their procedure was heart catheterization which in this case they should rest for a few days. All patients should remain on blood thinner medication for at least 6 months and up to a year unless the patient had a stroke in which they would always be on blood thinners. Patients with coronary artery disease or pulmonary hypertension will take additional medicines described by their physician. For patients who had heart surgery to repair the defect or received a transcatheter closure device, they will need to take some form of antibiotics to prevent infections such as endocarditis for at least 6 months following the procedure.",

        "content": "Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) refers to pneumonia (any of several lung diseases) contracted by a person outside of the healthcare system. In contrast, hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) is seen in patients who have recently visited a hospital or who live in long-term care facilities. CAP is common, affecting people of all ages, and its symptoms occur as a result of oxygen-absorbing areas of the lung (alveoli) filling with fluid. This inhibits lung function, causing dyspnea, fever, chest pains and cough. CAP, the most common type of pneumonia, is a leading cause of illness and death worldwide. Its causes include bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites. CAP is diagnosed by assessing symptoms, performing a physical examination, by x-ray or by sputum examination. Patients with CAP sometimes require hospitalization, and it is treated primarily with antibiotics, antipyretics and cough medicine. Some forms of CAP can be prevented by vaccination and by abstaining from tobacco products.",

The bacteria's toxin also causes the following symptoms: sore throat fever swollen glands in the neck The toxin may also be absorbed into the blood stream and cause damage to the heart, kidneys and nerves causing severe complications such as: blocking of the airway damage to the heart muscle (myocarditis) inflammation of nerves, which may cause nerve damage (polyneuropathy) paralysis lung infection (respiratory failure or pneumonia) death Even with treatment, 1 in 10 diphtheria patients die. Without treatment as many as half the patients can die from the disease.",
