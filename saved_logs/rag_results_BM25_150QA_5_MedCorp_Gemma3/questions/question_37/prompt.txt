With your own knowledge and the help of the following document:

Document 1 (Title: Lutembacher's syndrome): To increase quality life following ASD procedures/surgeries, patients should have a physical exam and ECG every 3, 6, and 12 months with their cardiologist. For many patients with secundum ASD closure repair, they can return to their normal activities unless their procedure was heart catheterization which in this case they should rest for a few days. All patients should remain on blood thinner medication for at least 6 months and up to a year unless the patient had a stroke in which they would always be on blood thinners. Patients with coronary artery disease or pulmonary hypertension will take additional medicines described by their physician. For patients who had heart surgery to repair the defect or received a transcatheter closure device, they will need to take some form of antibiotics to prevent infections such as endocarditis for at least 6 months following the procedure.
Document 2 (Title: Bangalore Medical College and Research Institute): Vanivilas Women and Children Hospital, also one of the oldest hospitals has 536 beds and an average of 75-80 patients are treated as out-patients every day, 17-20 patients admitted, and average 500 surgeries per month are conducted. It has well equipped Obstetrics, Gynecology, Pediatrics and Pediatric Surgery Departments. There is a neonatal intensive care unit. Vanivilas hospital is a center for excellence in prevention of parent to child transmission of AIDS. Bowring & Lady Curzon Hospitals is a multispeciality hospital, located in the heart of Bangalore City, at Shivajinagar. The hospital is over 100 years old, approximately 2 km towards east of Vidhana Soudha. It has 686 beds and an average of 700-900 patients are treated as outpatients every day, 70-80 patients get admitted, and average 420-450 deliveries per month are conducted in addition to 800 surgeries per month.
Document 3 (Title: Community-acquired pneumonia): Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) refers to pneumonia (any of several lung diseases) contracted by a person outside of the healthcare system. In contrast, hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) is seen in patients who have recently visited a hospital or who live in long-term care facilities. CAP is common, affecting people of all ages, and its symptoms occur as a result of oxygen-absorbing areas of the lung (alveoli) filling with fluid. This inhibits lung function, causing dyspnea, fever, chest pains and cough. CAP, the most common type of pneumonia, is a leading cause of illness and death worldwide. Its causes include bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites. CAP is diagnosed by assessing symptoms, performing a physical examination, by x-ray or by sputum examination. Patients with CAP sometimes require hospitalization, and it is treated primarily with antibiotics, antipyretics and cough medicine. Some forms of CAP can be prevented by vaccination and by abstaining from tobacco products.
Document 4 (Title: Childhood immunizations in the United States): Symptoms The bacteria that causes Diphtheria infects the respiratory system, produces a toxin that, within 2 to 3 days, kills tissue that then builds up over the nasal tissues, tonsils, voicebox and throat, in a thick gray coating called a "pseudomembrane," making it very hard to breathe and swallow. The bacteria's toxin also causes the following symptoms: sore throat fever swollen glands in the neck The toxin may also be absorbed into the blood stream and cause damage to the heart, kidneys and nerves causing severe complications such as: blocking of the airway damage to the heart muscle (myocarditis) inflammation of nerves, which may cause nerve damage (polyneuropathy) paralysis lung infection (respiratory failure or pneumonia) death Even with treatment, 1 in 10 diphtheria patients die. Without treatment as many as half the patients can die from the disease.
Document 5 (Title: Cleanroom): BS 5295 BS 5295 is a British Standard. BS 5295 Class 1 also requires that the greatest particle present in any sample can not exceed 5 μm. BS 5295 has been superseded, withdrawn since the year 2007 and replaced with "BS EN ISO 14644-6:2007". USP <800> Standards USP 800 is a United States standard developed by the United States Pharmacopeial Convention (USP) with an effective date of December 1, 2019. Ramifications and further applications In hospitals, theatres are similar to cleanrooms for surgical patients' operations with incisions to prevent any infections for the patient. In another case, severely immunocompromised patients sometimes have to be held in prolonged isolation from their surroundings, for fear of infection. At the extreme, this necessitates a cleanroom environment. The same is the case for patients carrying airborne infectious diseases, only they are handled at negative, not positive pressure.

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
Question: A 6-year-old male who recently immigrated to the United States from Asia is admitted to the hospital with dyspnea. Physical exam reveals a gray pseudomembrane in the patient's oropharynx along with lymphadenopathy. The patient develops myocarditis and expires on hospital day 5. Which of the following would have prevented this patient's presentation and decline?
Options:
A. Increased CD4+ T cell count
B. Secretory IgA against viral proteins
C. Increased IgM preventing bacterial invasion
D. Circulating IgG against AB exotoxin
