With your own knowledge and the help of the following document:

Document 1 (Title: Polio): Diagnosis Paralytic poliomyelitis may be clinically suspected in individuals experiencing acute onset of flaccid paralysis in one or more limbs with decreased or absent tendon reflexes in the affected limbs that cannot be attributed to another apparent cause, and without sensory or cognitive loss. A laboratory diagnosis is usually made based on the recovery of poliovirus from a stool sample or a swab of the pharynx. Antibodies to poliovirus can be diagnostic, and are generally detected in the blood of infected patients early in the course of infection. Analysis of the patient's cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which is collected by a lumbar puncture ("spinal tap"), reveals an increased number of white blood cells (primarily lymphocytes) and a mildly elevated protein level. Detection of virus in the CSF is diagnostic of paralytic polio but rarely occurs.
Document 2 (Title: Oropouche fever): Recent Research One study has focused on identifying OROV through the use of RNA extraction from reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. This study revealed that OROV caused central nervous system infections in three patients. The three patients all had meningoencephalitis and also showed signs of clear lympho-monocytic cellular pattern in CSF, high protein, and normal to slightly decreased glucose levels indicating they had viral infections. Two of the patients already had underlying infections that can effect the CNS and immune system and in particular one of these patients has HIV/AIDS and the third patient has neurocysticercosis. Two patients were infected with OROV developed meningitis and it was theorized that this is due to them being immunocompromised. Through this it was revealed that it's possible that the invasion of the central nervous system by the oropouche virus can be performed by a previous blood-brain barrier damage.

Document 3 (Title: Triplegia): A similar condition is triparesis, in which the patient suffers from paresis in three limbs, meaning that the limbs are very weak, but not completely paralyzed. In a case reported only due to its rarity, triplegia was reported following a tonsillectomy (surgical removal of the tonsils). An eight-year-old male patient was sent to Willard Parker Hospital on August 12, 1929 and had been diagnosed with poliomyelitis. After an unrelated, and routine, tonsillectomy there was complete flaccid paralysis and loss of feeling in both the legs, right arm, and muscles in the trunk.

Document 4 (Title: West Nile fever): West Nile neuroinvasive disease (WNND), which occurs in less than 1 percent of cases, is when the virus infects the central nervous system resulting in meningitis, encephalitis, meningoencephalitis or a poliomyelitis-like syndrome. Many patients with WNND have normal neuroimaging studies, although abnormalities may be present in various cerebral areas including the basal ganglia, thalamus, cerebellum, and brainstem. West Nile virus encephalitis (WNE) is the most common neuroinvasive manifestation of WNND. WNE presents with similar symptoms to other viral encephalitis with fever, headaches, and altered mental status. A prominent finding in WNE is muscular weakness (30 to 50 percent of patients with encephalitis), often with lower motor neuron symptoms, flaccid paralysis, and hyporeflexia with no sensory abnormalities.
Document 5 (Title: Bulbar palsy): Signs flaccid paralysis, such as soft palate weakness (examined by asking the patient to say aah). muscle atrophy, such as tongue atrophy with fasciculations. nasal speech lacking in modulation and difficulty with all consonants. drooling of saliva. normal or absent jaw jerk. reduced or absent gag reflex. In addition, there may be lower motor neuron lesions of the limbs. The ocular muscles are spared and this differentiates it from myasthenia gravis. Causes Genetic: Kennedy's disease, acute intermittent porphyria. Vascular causes: medullary infarction, such as lateral or medial medullary infarction. Degenerative diseases: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, syringobulbia, Wolfram syndrome. Inflammatory/infective: Guillain–Barré syndrome, poliomyelitis, Lyme disease. Cancer: brainstem glioma, malignant meningitis. Toxic: botulism, venom of bark scorpion (species Centruroides), some neurotoxic snake venoms. Autoimmune: myasthenia gravis.

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
Question: A 12-year-old boy who recently emigrated from Pakistan presents with fever, muscle pain, and weakness of the trunk, abdomen, and legs. The patient’s mother says that he has not been vaccinated. Physical examination reveals fasciculation and flaccid paralysis of the lower limbs. A CSF analysis reveals lymphocytosis with normal glucose and protein levels. A throat swab reveals an RNA virus. Which of the following would most likely be destroyed by the virus in this patient?
Options:
A. Posterior horn cells of the spinal cord
B. Myelin sheath of neurons
C. Muscle cells
D. Anterior horn of the spinal cord
