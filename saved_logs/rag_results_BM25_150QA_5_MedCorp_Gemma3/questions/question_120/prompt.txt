Document 1 (Title: Predicate transformer semantics): Monotonic Predicate transformers of interest (wp, wlp, and sp) are monotonic. A predicate transformer T is monotonic if and only if: This property is related to the consequence rule of Hoare logic. Strict A predicate transformer T is strict iff: For instance, wp is strict, whereas wlp is generally not. In particular, if statement S may not terminate then is satisfiable. We have Indeed, true is a valid invariant of that loop. Terminating A predicate transformer T is terminating iff: Actually, this terminology makes sense only for strict predicate transformers: indeed, is the weakest-precondition ensuring termination of S. It seems that naming this property non-aborting would be more appropriate: in total correctness, non-termination is abortion, whereas in partial correctness, it is not. Conjunctive A predicate transformer T is conjunctive iff: This is the case for , even if statement S is non-deterministic as a selection statement or a specification statement.

Document 3 (Title: Occam's razor): Testing the razor The razor's statement that "other things being equal, simpler explanations are generally better than more complex ones" is amenable to empirical testing. Another interpretation of the razor's statement would be that "simpler hypotheses are generally better than the complex ones". The procedure to test the former interpretation would compare the track records of simple and comparatively complex explanations. If one accepts the first interpretation, the validity of Occam's razor as a tool would then have to be rejected if the more complex explanations were more often correct than the less complex ones (while the converse would lend support to its use). If the latter interpretation is accepted, the validity of Occam's razor as a tool could possibly be accepted if the simpler hypotheses led to correct conclusions more often than not.
Document 4 (Title: Quality storyboard): Analysis of Causes: Is there a clear statement of the major cause(s) of the issue? Have you explained how the possible causes were theorized? Are data included showing how the main causes were identified? Are data displayed in such a way that the connection between the issue and the cause(s) is clear? Have you explained how the data were collected and over what time-period they were collected? Plans: Is there a complete Purpose Statement and objectives designed to move toward the purpose: Direction, measure, reference, target, time frame, and owner? Is it clear how the target was derived from the analysis? Is it clear that the actions in the plan are aimed at correcting root cause(s)? Have you indicated what alternative solutions were considered, and how they were evaluated to select the best improvement theory? Have you included a copy of the planning documents? Have you indicated whether the plan was implemented on schedule? Study:
Document 5 (Title: Progress on the CSE diagnostic study. Application of McNemar's test revisited.): The authors describe an extension of McNemar's test that can be used to compare diagnostic performance when multiple statements are obtained from computer analysis or visual interpretation of the ECG. If two or more diagnostic statements are made, by definition only one can be correct for the cases in the CSE pilot database, which were selected for single, clinically well documented, abnormalities. If one statement stood out from others as being made with the highest degree of certainty, that was accepted as the single interpretation, right or wrong. However, when two or more statements were made with the same degree of certainty and only one statement was correct, then in the previous application of McNemar's test that interpretation was given credit for being correct. In the extension of the method presented in this article, such an interpretation is given partial credit for the one correct statement and partial discredit for any incorrect statement, thereby reporting the results more properly in the sensitivity and specificity statistics for the different diagnostic categories.
