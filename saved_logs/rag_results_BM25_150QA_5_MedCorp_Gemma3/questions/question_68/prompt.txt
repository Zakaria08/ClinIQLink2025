Document 1 (Title: Nephrectomy): A nephrectomy is the surgical removal of a kidney, performed to treat a number of kidney diseases including kidney cancer. It is also done to remove a normal healthy kidney from a living or deceased donor, which is part of a kidney transplant procedure. History The first recorded nephrectomy was performed in 1861 by Erastus Bradley Wolcott in Wisconsin. The patient had been suffering from a large tumor and the operation was initially successful, but the patient died fifteen days later. The first planned nephrectomy was performed by the German surgeon Gustav Simon on August 2, 1869 in Heidelberg. Simon practiced the operation beforehand in animal experiments. He proved that one healthy kidney can be sufficient for urine excretion in humans. Indications
Document 2 (Title: Madeline Cheek Hunter): Hunter identified seven components for teaching: knowledge of human growth and development content classroom management materials planning human relations instructional skills Hunter also developed a direct instructional model and elements of effective instruction. The instructional model has seven components: objectives standards anticipatory set teaching (input, modeling, checking for understanding) guided practice/monitoring closure independent practice The elements of effective instruction are very similar to those of the instructional model, featuring seven components of teaching and behavioral objectives: objectives set(hook) standards/expectations teaching (input, modeling/demo, direction giving, and checking for understanding) guided practice closure independent practice Hunter was the creator of Instructional Theory into Practice (ITIP). ITIP is a teaching model on inservice/staff development program widely used during the 1970s and 1980s.
Document 3 (Title: Nephrectomy): Complications Patients who undergo partial nephrectomy experience complications around 15-25% of the time. The most common complications are bleeding, infection and urinary leak. Cancer control, quality of life, and survival Partial nephrectomy offers the same chance of cure from the renal cell cancer as radical nephrectomy. This was confirmed in a recent meta-analysis. Partial nephrectomy has been shown to maintain kidney function better than total removal. There is some debate whether this preservation of kidney function leads to long-term benefits to the patient. Some studies have found that patients treated by partial nephrectomy live longer than patients who had their whole kidney removed. Other studies have found the opposite. Partial nephrectomy has been associated with better quality of life compared to radical nephrectomy. See also Kidney donation List of surgeries by type References
Document 4 (Title: [High resection of the left testicular vein and ligation of the internal iliac artery using a retroperitoneoscope].): In 90 youths at the age of from 14 to 16 years suffering from left-sided varicocele, the authors have used a retroperitoneoscope for high ligation and transection of the testicular vein. There were no complications at the time of operation and after it. In control examination 1.5-2 years later, no varicocele recurrences were revealed. In 15 patients with profuse bleeding from carcinomatous tumor of the urinary bladder, the authors performed ligation of the internal iliac arteries by means of a retroperitoneoscope.
Document 5 (Title: Task Trainers in Procedural Skills Acquisition in Medical Simulation -- Curriculum Development): Using a task trainer can allow for the creation of a simple teaching model leading to a standardized teaching approach and, ultimately, a sustainable outcome. For many years, the standard of practice in the medical community has been Halstead's "See one, Do one, Teach one" but this has become less acceptable, particularly when invasive procedures and high-risk care are involved. [4] [5] A more efficient model for teaching procedures that combines multiple aspects of adult learning is Peyton's 4 step approach (see Figure 1). [6] In this model, a teacher can demonstrate the procedure on the task trainer to the learner with no commentary as the first step.
