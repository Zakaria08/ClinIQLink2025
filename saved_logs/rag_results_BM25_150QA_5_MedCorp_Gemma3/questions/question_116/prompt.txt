Document 1 (Title: Seville Statement on Violence): Core Ideas The statement contains five core ideas. These ideas are: "It is scientifically incorrect to say that we have inherited a tendency to make war from our animal ancestors." "It is scientifically incorrect to say that war or any other violent behaviour is genetically programmed into our human nature." "It is scientifically incorrect to say that in the course of human evolution there has been a selection for aggressive behaviour more than for other kinds of behaviour." "It is scientifically incorrect to say that humans have a 'violent brain'." "It is scientifically incorrect to say that war is caused by 'instinct' or any single motivation." The statement concludes: "Just as 'wars begin in the minds of men', peace also begins in our minds. The same species who invented war is capable of inventing peace. The responsibility lies with each of us." Founding scientists The following is a list of the scientists who founded the statement:
Document 2 (Title: Are we getting informed consent from patients with cancer?): We developed a consent form for a hypothetical trial and asked patients to underline information that was pertinent to their decision to accept or refuse to participate in the proposed trial. We also investigated whether patients correctly interpreted statements describing the probability of certain events occurring. Of the 50 patients, 74% did not indicate that both risks and benefits were pertinent. Of the 20 patients who would not enter the trial, 70% focused on risks of therapy only. In contrast, of the 30 who agreed to enter, only 33% focused entirely on risks, while 10% did not note potential for either benefit or risk. For each of four probability statements, patients chose one of four possible interpretations, only one of which was correct. Depending on the statement, between 26 and 54% of the interpretations were incorrect. It appears that many decisions regarding trial entry may be based upon incomplete or incorrect information.
Document 3 (Title: Progress on the CSE diagnostic study. Application of McNemar's test revisited.): The authors describe an extension of McNemar's test that can be used to compare diagnostic performance when multiple statements are obtained from computer analysis or visual interpretation of the ECG. If two or more diagnostic statements are made, by definition only one can be correct for the cases in the CSE pilot database, which were selected for single, clinically well documented, abnormalities. If one statement stood out from others as being made with the highest degree of certainty, that was accepted as the single interpretation, right or wrong. However, when two or more statements were made with the same degree of certainty and only one statement was correct, then in the previous application of McNemar's test that interpretation was given credit for being correct. In the extension of the method presented in this article, such an interpretation is given partial credit for the one correct statement and partial discredit for any incorrect statement, thereby reporting the results more properly in the sensitivity and specificity statistics for the different diagnostic categories.
Document 4 (Title: Proportional reasoning): Viewing These Strategies as Functional Relations Let T be the height of Mr. Tall and S be the height of Mr. Short, then the correct multiplicative strategy can be expressed as T/S = 3/2; this is a constant ratio relation. The incorrect additive strategy can be expressed as T – S = 2; this is a constant difference relation. Here is the graph for these two equations. For the numeric values involved in the problem statement, these graphs are “similar” and it is easy to see why individuals consider their incorrect answers perfectly reasonable.
Document 5 (Title: Predicate transformer semantics): Conjunctive A predicate transformer T is conjunctive iff: This is the case for , even if statement S is non-deterministic as a selection statement or a specification statement. Disjunctive A predicate transformer T is disjunctive iff: This is generally not the case of when S is non-deterministic. Indeed, consider a non-deterministic statement S choosing an arbitrary boolean. This statement is given here as the following selection statement: Then, reduces to the formula . Hence, reduces to the tautology Whereas, the formula reduces to the wrong proposition . The same counter-example can be reproduced using a specification statement (see above) instead: @
