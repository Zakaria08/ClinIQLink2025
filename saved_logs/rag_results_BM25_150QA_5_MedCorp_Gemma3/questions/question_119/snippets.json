        "content": "Titrations with hypochlorite While relatively unstable and requiring frequent standardization, sodium hypochlorite has been used in a very rapid thermometric titration method for the determination of ammonium ion. This is an alternative to the classical approach of ammonia distillation from basic solution and consequent acid\u2013base titration. The thermometric titration is carried out in bicarbonate solution containing bromide ion (Brown et al., 1969). Complexometric (EDTA) titrations Thermometric titrations employing sodium salts of ethylenediaminetetra-acetic acid (EDTA) have been demonstrated for the determination of a range of metal ions. Reaction enthalpies are modest, so titrations are normally carried out with titrant concentrations of 1 mol/L. This necessitates the use of the tetra-sodium salt of EDTA rather than the more common di-sodium salt which is saturated at a concentration of only approximately 0.25 mol/L.",

This can place a restriction on the lower limit of sulfate in a sample which can be analyzed. Titration of aluminium with fluoride Thermometric titrimetry offers a rapid, highly precise method for the determination of aluminium in solution. A solution of aluminium is conditioned with acetate buffer and an excess of sodium and potassium ions. Titration with sodium or potassium fluoride yields the exothermic precipitation of an insoluble alumino-fluoride salt.

Adding the amount of excess dichromate from the initial amount, gives the amount of ethanol present. Accuracy can be improved by calibrating the dichromate solution against a blank.",

        "title": "Organic peroxides",
        "content": "Several analytical methods are used for qualitative and quantitative determination of peroxides. A simple qualitative detection of peroxides is carried out with the iodine-starch reaction. Here peroxides, hydroperoxides or peracids oxidize the added potassium iodide into iodine, which reacts with starch producing a deep-blue color. Commercial paper indicators using this reaction are available. This method is also suitable for quantitative evaluation, but it can not distinguish between different types of peroxide compounds. Discoloration of various indigo dyes in presence of peroxides is used instead for this purpose. For example, the loss of blue color in leuco-methylene blue is selective for hydrogen peroxide. Quantitative analysis of hydroperoxides can be performed using potentiometric titration with lithium aluminium hydride. Another way to evaluate the content of peracids and peroxides is the volumetric titration with alkoxides such as sodium ethoxide.",
