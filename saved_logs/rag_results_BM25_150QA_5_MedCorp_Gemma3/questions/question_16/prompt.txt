Document 1 (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung): Helge Eilers, MD, & Spencer Yost, MD An elderly man with type 2 diabetes mellitus and ischemic pain in the lower extremity is scheduled for femoral-to-popliteal artery bypass surgery. He has a history of hyper-tension and coronary artery disease with symptoms of stable angina. He can walk only half a block before pain in his legs forces him to stop. He has a 50-pack-year smoking history but stopped 2 years ago. Medications include atenolol, atorvastatin, and hydrochlorothiazide. The nurse in the preoperative holding area obtains the following vital signs: temperature 36.8°C (98.2°F), blood pressure 168/100 mm Hg, heart rate 78 bpm, oxygen saturation by pulse oximeter 96% while breathing room air, and pain 5/10 in the right lower leg after walking into the hospital. What anesthetic agents will you choose for his anesthetic plan? Why? Does the choice of anesthetic make a difference?
Document 2 (Title: [An autopsy case of carcinomatous sensory neuropathy associated with gastric adenosquamous carcinoma].): A 61-year-old man was admitted on May 1986 with complaints of hypesthesia and pain in the both legs, and of progressive difficulty in walking. Physical examination was unremarkable. On neurological examination, deep tendon reflexes were decreased in all extremities without pathological reflexes. Vibration sense was decreased severely at the medial malleolus and moderately at the anterior superior iliac spine. Joint sensation of the toes was moderately decreased. Light touch, temperature discrimination, and pinprick sensation were slightly decreased on fingers bilaterally and distal to the middle part of both legs. Muscle strength was normal. His gait was unsteady and Romberg's sign was positive. Finger to nose test and heel to knee test were mildly disturbed bilaterally. The sural nerve action potential was not elicited on electrical stimulation. Laboratory studies for malignancy showed gastric cancer. Only July 4, he underwent subtotal gastrectomy. Histologically it showed adenosquamous carcinoma. Postoperatively gait disturbance and pain in both legs improved slightly. Peak latencies of P2 of SEP following right and left posterior tibial nerve stimulation were 47. 9 msec and 48.8 msec on February 14, and 44.5 msec and 43.9 msec on October 6, 1986, respectively, and their postoperative shortening was evident. He died of multiple liver and lung metastasis of the gastric cancer in November 28, 1986. At autopsy, tumor metastasis were noted in liver, lung and perigastroduodenal and retroperitoneal lymph nodes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Document 3 (Title: [The protrusion of thoracic intervertebral disc-thoracic spondylosis (author's transl)].): The protrusion of cervical intervertebral discs was divided into three pathological entities by Spurling; soft disc, hard disc and spondylosis. We applied these concept to the dorsal intervertebral disc disease and treated two cases of thoracic spondylosis. Case 1. A 41-year-old male entered the hospital because of the gradual progression of weakness of both legs of two months' duration. Since ten days before admission he had not had an errection and had not been to able to walk and micturate. He also complained of paresthesia radiating down the abdomen into both legs. There were no visceral complaints. Neurological examination revealed severe weakness of both legs with bilateral impairment of deep sensations and hypalgesia up to the level of T6. Reflexes in both legs were hyperactive with sustained clonus. Plantar responses were extensor bilaterally. Though plain X-rays showed no changes, tomography revealed a calcified intervertebral spur formation at the T5-6 interspace. A myelogram showed a complete block of the contrast medium at the level of the upper part of T6. The patient underwent a complete laminectomy from T3 through T6 and extradural anterior decompression with the removal of the calcified disc at the T5-6 interspace using an air drill. Postoperatively, he demonstrated an immediate improvement in sensation and a gradual recovery in motor power. At his follow-up examination 14 months after surgery he could walk without assistance. Case 2. A 47-year-old dwarfish woman (130 cm) with a low back pain and difficulty in walking for a few years duration was admitted. A few months before admission she felt pain at her left lateral abdomen. There was weakness of both legs, greater in the left. Reflexes in her left lower extremity were hyperactive with sustained clonus. Plantar responces were flexor bilaterally. Palin X-rays showed scoliosis of thoracic spine with the top at T7 level and calcified intervertebral masses at T10-11, T11-12 and T12-L1, extending into the canal that were confirmed more clearly by tomography. Myelography by a cisternal puncture disclosed a complete block at the level of T10. The patient underwent total laminectomy of T9 through L2 and extradural anterior decompression with the removal of calcified discs. At her follow-up examination 12 months after surgery she could walk for herself with some residual neurological signs, minimal weakness in the right leg and hypesthesia up to the level of T12 in the left. We have discussed the incidental, related diagnostic and operative problems of this disease.
Document 4 (Title: [Chronic demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy associated with malignant histiocytosis].): A case of malignant histiocytosis (MH) presenting with peripheral nerve involvement is described. A 67-year-old man initially noted left facial weakness on July 20, 1986. The symptom was improved within a week, however, two weeks later he noticed numbness in his fingers and a burning pain in his legs, which was followed by double vision and progressive weakness in all four limbs. On examination, he was found to have total ophthalmoparesis of the right eye and a trace of the left facial palsy. There was severe weakness of the leg muscles, as well as mild weakness of the arms. This was accompanied by wasting of his limbs. All tendon reflexes were absent. Planter responses were flexor. Although cutaneous sensation was intact, vibratory sense was markedly impaired in the legs below the knees. The sphincter function was mildly disturbed. The sedimentation rate was 32 mm/hr. The hemoglobin was 11.9 g/dl and the leukocyte count was 5,700/mm3. The platelet count fell to 60,000/mm3. Results of routine biochemical and radiological studies were unremarkable. The cerebrospinal fluid protein level was 129 mg/dl with a normal cell count. Motor nerve conduction study revealed marked reduction in amplitude of the compound muscle action potential, slow motor nerve conduction velocities and multifocal conduction blocks along the nerve trunks (the left ulnar nerve in the forearm, the bilateral tibial nerve in the lower leg). F-wave was absent or elicited with prolonged latency and with increased chrono-dispersion. Sensory nerve had normal or nearly normal conduction. EMG sampling showed an impaired interference pattern during voluntary contraction and a few denervation potentials at rest.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Document 5 (Title: Anatomy_Gray): A 53-year-old man presented to the emergency department with a 5-hour history of sharp pleuritic chest pain and shortness of breath. The day before he was on a long haul flight, returning from his holidays. He was usually fit and well and was a keen mountain climber. He had no previous significant medical history. On physical examination his lungs were clear, he was tachypneic at 24/min, and his saturation was reduced to 92% on room air. Pulmonary embolism was suspected and the patient was referred for a CT pulmonary angiogram. The study demonstrated clots within the right and left main pulmonary arteries. There was no pleural effusion, lung collapse, or consolidation. He was immediately started on subcutaneous enoxaparin and converted to oral anticoagulation over the course of a couple of days. The whole treatment lasted 6 months as no other risk factors (except immobilization during a long haul flight) were identified. There were no permanent sequelae.

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
Question: A 68-year-old man presents to the emergency department with leg pain. He states that the pain started suddenly while he was walking outside. The patient has a past medical history of diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and atrial fibrillation. His temperature is 99.3°F (37.4°C), blood pressure is 152/98 mmHg, pulse is 97/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. Physical exam is notable for a cold and pale left leg. The patient’s sensation is markedly diminished in the left leg when compared to the right, and his muscle strength is 1/5 in his left leg. Which of the following is the best next step in management?
Options:
A. Graded exercise and aspirin
B. Heparin drip
C. Surgical thrombectomy
D. Tissue plasminogen activator
