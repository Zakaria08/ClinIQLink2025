With your own knowledge and the help of the following document:

Document 1 (Title: BCS1L): Growth retardation, aminoaciduria, cholestasis, iron overload, lactic acidosis, and early death (GRACILE) is a recessively inherited lethal disease that results in mutli-system organ failure. GRACILE is characterized by fetal growth retardation, lactic acidosis, aminoaciduria, cholestasis, and abnormalities in iron metabolism. Pathogenic mutations have included S78G, R144Q, and V327A. Bjoernstad syndrome is an autosomal recessive disease primarily affecting hearing. This disease is characterized by congenital hearing loss and twisted hairs, a condition known as pili torti, in which hair shafts are flattened at irregular intervals and twisted 180 degrees from the normal axis, making the hair extremely brittle. Pathogenic mutations have included Y301N, R184C, G35R, R114W, R183H, Q302E, and R306H. These mutations tend to affect the protein-protein interactions of BCS1L.
Document 2 (Title: Cholestasis): Cholestatic liver cell rosettes may occur in children with chronic cholestasis. Histologically, this is evident as two or more hepatocytes in a pseudotubular fashion that encircle a segment of enlarged bile canaliculi. Children may also have giant hepatocytes present, which are characterized by a pigmented spongy appearance. Giant cell formation is likely caused by the detergent properties of bile salts causing a loss of the lateral membrane and joining of hepatocytes. In the case of Alagille syndrome, hepatocyte degeneration is uncommon. However, there may be a small amount of apoptosis and enlarged hepatocytes.
Document 3 (Title: Gilbert's syndrome): Dubin–Johnson syndrome and Rotor syndrome are rarer autosomal recessive disorders characterized by an increase of conjugated bilirubin. Viral hepatitis associated with increase of conjugated bilirubin can be excluded by negative blood samples for antigens specific to the different hepatitis viruses. Cholestasis can be excluded by normal levels of bile acids in plasma, the absence of lactate dehydrogenase, low levels of conjugated bilirubin, and ultrasound scan of the bile ducts.
Document 4 (Title: Multisystem developmental disorder): Other uses of the term The term multisystem developmental disorder has also been used to describe various developmental disorders. These include: Alagille syndrome, an autosomal dominant disorder with a wide range of features and manifestations. Its five most significant features are chronic cholestasis, a condition where bile cannot flow from the liver to the duodenum, occurring in 95% of cases; heart abnormalities (over 90%); butterfly vertebrae; posterior embryotoxon and a distinctive face (prominent forehead, deep-set eyes, and a pointed chin). Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome, a mental retardation syndrome characterized by broad thumbs, facial abnormalities, and big toes alongside mental retardation.
Document 5 (Title: Cholestasis): Among psychotropic drugs, chlorpromazine is known to cause cholestatic hepatitis. Tricyclic antidepressants (imipramine, amitriptyline) and SSRIs (duloxetine) causing cholestasis have also been reported. Anti-inflammatory drugs with cholestatic potential include the immunosuppressant azathioprine, which has been reported to cause fatal cholestatic hepatitis, and the NSAID diclofenac. Rare causes of cholestasis The causes of cholestasis are diverse, and some feature more prominently than others. Some rare causes include primary sclerosing cholangitis, primary biliary cholangitis, familial intrahepatic cholestasis, Alagille syndrome, sepsis, total parenteral nutrition-based cholestasis, benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis, biliary atresia, and intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy. Primary biliary cholangitis
