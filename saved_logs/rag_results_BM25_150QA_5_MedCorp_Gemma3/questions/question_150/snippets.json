        "content": "Growth retardation, aminoaciduria, cholestasis, iron overload, lactic acidosis, and early death (GRACILE) is a recessively inherited lethal disease that results in mutli-system organ failure. GRACILE is characterized by fetal growth retardation, lactic acidosis, aminoaciduria, cholestasis, and abnormalities in iron metabolism. Pathogenic mutations have included S78G, R144Q, and V327A. Bjoernstad syndrome is an autosomal recessive disease primarily affecting hearing. This disease is characterized by congenital hearing loss and twisted hairs, a condition known as pili torti, in which hair shafts are flattened at irregular intervals and twisted 180 degrees from the normal axis, making the hair extremely brittle. Pathogenic mutations have included Y301N, R184C, G35R, R114W, R183H, Q302E, and R306H. These mutations tend to affect the protein-protein interactions of BCS1L.",

        "content": "Cholestatic liver cell rosettes may occur in children with chronic cholestasis. Histologically, this is evident as two or more hepatocytes in a pseudotubular fashion that encircle a segment of enlarged bile canaliculi. Children may also have giant hepatocytes present, which are characterized by a pigmented spongy appearance. Giant cell formation is likely caused by the detergent properties of bile salts causing a loss of the lateral membrane and joining of hepatocytes. In the case of Alagille syndrome, hepatocyte degeneration is uncommon. However, there may be a small amount of apoptosis and enlarged hepatocytes.",

These include: Alagille syndrome, an autosomal dominant disorder with a wide range of features and manifestations. Its five most significant features are chronic cholestasis, a condition where bile cannot flow from the liver to the duodenum, occurring in 95% of cases; heart abnormalities (over 90%); butterfly vertebrae; posterior embryotoxon and a distinctive face (prominent forehead, deep-set eyes, and a pointed chin). Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome, a mental retardation syndrome characterized by broad thumbs, facial abnormalities, and big toes alongside mental retardation.",
