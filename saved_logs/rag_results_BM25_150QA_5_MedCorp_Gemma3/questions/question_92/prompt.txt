Document 1 (Title: Pseudocyst): Endoscopic drainage is becoming the preferred method of draining pseudocysts because it is less invasive, does not require external drain, and has a large long-term success rate. Drainage is usually achieved with a transpapillary approach with ERCP. Sometimes a direct drainage across the stomach or duodenal wall is used instead. The transpapillary approach is used when the pseudocyst is in communication with the main pancreatic duct, and is also successful in patients with pancreatic duct disruption. Transgastric or transduodenal approaches are used when the pseudocyst is next to the gastro-duodenal wall. Endoscopic ultrasound is the most commonly used test to gather the needed information about the pseudocyst for this method.
Document 2 (Title: Cholecystectomy): Natural orifice transluminal Natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) is an experimental technique where the laparoscope is inserted through natural orifices and internal incisions, rather than skin incisions, to access to the abdominal cavity. This offers the potential to eliminate visible scars. Since 2007, cholecystectomy by NOTES has been performed anecdotally via transgastric and transvaginal routes. As of 2009 the risk of gastrointestinal leak, difficulty visualizing the abdominal cavity and other technical limitations limited further adoption of NOTES for cholecystectomy.

Document 4 (Title: A novel endoscopic transgastric fundoplication procedure for gastroesophageal reflux: an initial animal evaluation.): Complications of gastroesophageal reflux are common in adults and children. A variety of surgical procedures have been successfully used to treat this condition. All current techniques require open surgery and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality, particularly in the high risk, neurologically damaged child. The authors have developed a novel method of creating a gastric fundoplication using an endoscopic transgastric approach in pigs. The procedure involves the creation of an esophageal intussusception into the stomach under direct vision with an endoscope. The gastric fundus is then plicated around the esophagus using a custom stapling device. The transgastric approach allows creation of a fundoplication, is easily performed, is potentially effective at preventing gastroesophageal reflux, and has the obvious advantages of minimally invasive surgery over open techniques of fundoplication.
Document 5 (Title: Immune thrombocytopenic purpura): Surgery Splenectomy (removal of the spleen) may be considered in patients who are either unresponsive to steroid treatment, have frequent relapses, or cannot be tapered off steroids after a few months. Platelets which have been bound by antibodies are taken up by macrophages in the spleen (which have Fc receptors), and so removal of the spleen reduces platelet destruction. The procedure is potentially risky in ITP cases due to the increased possibility of significant bleeding during surgery. Durable remission following splenectomy is achieved in 60 - 80 percent of ITP cases. Even though there is a consensus regarding the short-term efficacy of splenectomy, findings on its long-term efficacy and side-effects are controversial. After splenectomy, 11.6 - 75 percent of ITP cases relapsed, and 8.7 - 40 percent of ITP cases had no response to splenectomy. The use of splenectomy to treat ITP has diminished since the development of steroid therapy and other pharmaceutical remedies.
