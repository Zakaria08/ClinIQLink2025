Document 1 (Title: Syncope during bathing in infants a pediatric form of water induced urticaria): Background: Apparent life threatening events in infants are a difficult and frequent problem in pediatric practice. The prognosis is uncertain because of risk of sudden infant death syndrome. Case reports: Eight infants aged 2 to 15 months were admitted during a period of 6 years; they suffered from similar maladies in the bath: on immersion, they became pale, hypotonic, still and unreactive; recovery took a few seconds after withdrawal from the bath and stimulation. Two diagnoses were initially considered: seizure or gastroesophageal reflux but this was doubtful. The hypothesis of an equivalent of aquagenic urticaria was then considered; as for patients with this disease, each infant's family contained members suffering from dermographism, maladies or eruption after exposure to water or sun. All six infants had dermographism. We found an increase in blood histamine levels after a trial bath in the two infants tested. The evolution of these "aquagenic maladies" was favourable after a few weeks without baths. After a 2–7 year follow up, three out of seven infants continue to suffer from troubles associated with sun or water. Conclusion: "Aquagenic maladies" could be a pediatric form of the aquagenic urticaria.
Document 2 (Title: Thermoregulatory and Cardiovascular Responses to Bathing in Infancy): Syncope during infant bathing represents an uncommon but potentially concerning phenomenon that has generated clinical interest regarding its pathophysiological mechanisms and relationship to other vasovagal conditions. Case series document infants, typically between 4-12 months of age, experiencing sudden pallor, limpness, and brief loss of consciousness during or immediately following water immersion, with rapid and complete recovery. These episodes bear striking resemblance to the clinical presentation of water-induced urticaria, a rare physical urticaria subtype characterized by cutaneous and sometimes systemic reactions following water contact. Overlapping features include the temporal relationship to water exposure, absence of urticarial lesions in some cases, and potential for cardiovascular manifestations including hypotension. Pathophysiological investigation into bathing-related syncope reveals several potential mechanisms. Thermal stress from water immersion triggers complex cardiovascular adaptations, with sudden exposure to warm water inducing peripheral vasodilation and potential venous pooling, reducing effective circulating volume. Concurrent vagal stimulation from temperature-sensitive receptors may precipitate bradycardia, further compromising cerebral perfusion. Autonomic regulation remains incompletely developed in infants, potentially predisposing them to exaggerated vasovagal responses to thermal stimuli. The similarity to water-induced urticaria extends beyond clinical presentation to proposed mechanisms, which include water-induced histamine release through direct mast cell activation or osmotic changes altering cell membrane permeability. While classic water-induced urticaria typically presents with visible cutaneous manifestations, variant forms with predominantly cardiovascular manifestations have been documented. Diagnostic evaluation of affected infants typically includes cardiac assessment to exclude structural or rhythm disturbances, with electroencephalography considered if atypical features suggest seizure activity. Management focuses primarily on preventive measures including temperature modification, maintaining appropriate environmental warmth, limiting immersion duration, and ensuring adequate hydration. Some cases demonstrate responsiveness to antihistamine prophylaxis, providing further evidence for a shared mechanism with physical urticarias. Long-term prognosis appears favorable, with many cases resolving spontaneously with maturation of autonomic regulatory mechanisms, though longitudinal studies remain limited.
Document 3 (Title: Current Recommendations for Reducing Sudden Infant Death Syndrome Risk): Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) remains a leading cause of death in infants between one month and one year of age, with peak incidence between two and four months. Following comprehensive epidemiological studies and the introduction of targeted preventive measures, SIDS rates have declined significantly over the past three decades. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and similar organizations worldwide have established evidence-based recommendations focusing on modifiable risk factors. The single most effective intervention involves infant sleep positioning, with clear evidence demonstrating that placing infants on their backs (supine position) on a firm sleep surface reduces SIDS risk by approximately 50%. This 'Back to Sleep' campaign has been credited with the dramatic reduction in SIDS rates since its introduction in the 1990s. Contrary to previous practices, maintaining a high ambient room temperature and excessive bundling are now recognized as potential risk factors rather than protective measures. Similarly, the use of positioning devices, wedges, or rolled blankets to maintain sleep position is discouraged due to suffocation risks. While some studies suggested that pacifier use during sleep might confer modest protective effects, avoiding pacifiers was not found to reduce SIDS risk. Current guidelines emphasize room-sharing without bed-sharing, avoiding soft bedding or objects in the sleep environment, and eliminating exposure to tobacco smoke as additional key preventive strategies.
