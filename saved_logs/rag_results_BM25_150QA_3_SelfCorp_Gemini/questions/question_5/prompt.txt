Document 1 (Title: Coagulation Defects in Young Women with Menorrhagia): Menorrhagia, defined as excessive menstrual bleeding lasting more than 7 days or exceeding 80 mL per cycle, affects approximately 10-30% of women of reproductive age, with a significant proportion attributable to underlying bleeding disorders. When persistent since menarche and accompanied by other mucocutaneous bleeding manifestations, inherited coagulation disorders warrant particular consideration. Von Willebrand disease (VWD), the most common inherited bleeding disorder, affects approximately 1% of the general population and accounts for up to 20% of unexplained menorrhagia cases in otherwise healthy women. VWD results from quantitative or qualitative deficiencies in von Willebrand factor (VWF), a large multimeric glycoprotein that mediates platelet adhesion to subendothelial collagen and serves as a carrier for factor VIII. This autosomal inheritance pattern leads to equal sex distribution, contrasting with the X-linked recessive inheritance of hemophilia A, which primarily affects males. Laboratory evaluation of VWD typically reveals prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) due to secondary factor VIII deficiency, while prothrombin time (PT) and platelet count remain normal. Patients typically present with mucocutaneous bleeding manifestations including easy bruising, epistaxis, gingival bleeding, and particularly menorrhagia in women. Family history often reveals similar bleeding tendencies in first-degree relatives of both sexes, contrasting with the maternal uncle pattern in hemophilia A or the prothrombotic tendencies in conditions like protein C deficiency or antiphospholipid syndrome.
Document 2 (Title: Nitroglycerin): Nitroglycerin belongs to a group of drugs called nitrates, which includes many other nitrates like isosorbide dinitrate (Isordil) and isosorbide mononitrate (Imdur, Ismo, Monoket).[35] These agents all exert their effect by being converted to nitric oxide in the body by mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH2),[8] and nitric oxide is a potent natural vasodilator. Nitro   bangy stuff Nitroglycerin in three different forms: intravenous, sublingual spray, and the nitroglycerin patch. In medicine, nitroglycerin is probably most commonly prescribed for angina pectoris, a painful symptom of ischemic heart disease caused by inadequate flow of blood and oxygen to the heart and as a potent antihypertensive agent. Nitroglycerin corrects the imbalance between the flow of oxygen and blood to the heart and the heart's energy demand.[35] There are many formulations on the market at different doses. At low doses, nitroglycerin dilates veins more than arteries, thereby reducing preload (volume of blood in the heart after filling); this is thought to be its primary mechanism of action. By decreasing preload, the heart has less blood to pump, which decreases oxygen requirement since the heart does not have to work as hard. Additionally, having a smaller preload reduces the ventricular transmural pressure (pressure exerted on the walls of the heart), which decreases the compression of heart arteries to allow more blood to flow through the heart. At higher doses, it also dilates arteries, thereby reducing afterload (decreasing the pressure against which the heart must pump).[35] An improved ratio of myocardial oxygen demand to supply leads to the following therapeutic effects during episodes of angina pectoris: subsiding of chest pain, decrease of blood pressure, increase of heart rate, and orthostatic hypotension. Patients experiencing angina when doing certain physical activities can often prevent symptoms by taking nitroglycerin 5 to 10 minutes before the activity. Overdoses may generate methemoglobinemia.[36][37]
Document 3 (Title: Ethylene glycol poisoning): Signs and symptoms Signs of ethylene glycol poisoning depend upon the time after ingestion. Symptoms usually follow a three step progression, although poisoned individuals will not always develop each stage. Stage 1 (30 minutes to 12 hours) consists of neurological and gastrointestinal symptoms and looks similar to alcohol poisoning. Poisoned individuals may appear to be intoxicated, dizzy, lacking coordination of muscle movements, drooling, depressed, and have slurred speech, seizures, abnormal eye movements, headaches, and confusion. Irritation to the stomach may cause nausea and vomiting. Also seen are excessive thirst and urination. Over time, the body metabolizes ethylene glycol into other toxins. Stage 2 (12 to 36 hours) where signs of “alcohol” poisoning appear to resolve, underlying severe internal damage is still occurring. An elevated heart rate, hyperventilation or increased breathing effort, and dehydration may start to develop, along with high blood pressure and metabolic acidosis. These symptoms are a result of accumulation of organic acids formed by the metabolism of ethylene glycol. Additionally low calcium concentrations in the blood, overactive muscle reflexes, muscle spasms, QT interval prolongation, and congestive heart failure may occur. If untreated, death most commonly occurs during this period. Stage 3 (24 to 72 hours) kidney failure is the result of ethylene glycol poisoning. In cats, this stage occurs 12–24 hours after consuming antifreeze; in dogs, at 36–72 hours after consuming antifreeze. During this stage, severe kidney failure is developing secondary to calcium oxalate crystals forming in the kidneys. Severe lethargy, coma, depression, vomiting, seizures, drooling, and inappetence may be seen. Other symptoms include acute tubular necrosis, red blood cells in the urine, excess proteins in the urine, lower back pain, decreased or absent production of urine, elevated blood concentration of potassium, and acute kidney failure. If kidney failure occurs it is typically reversible, although weeks or months of supportive care including hemodialysis may be required before kidney function returns.

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
Question: A 20-year-old woman presents with menorrhagia for the past several years. She says that her menses “have always been heavy”, and she has experienced easy bruising for as long as she can remember. Family history is significant for her mother, who had similar problems with bruising easily. The patient's vital signs include: heart rate 98/min, respiratory rate 14/min, temperature 36.1°C (96.9°F), and blood pressure 110/87 mm Hg. Physical examination is unremarkable. Laboratory tests show the following: platelet count 200,000/mm3, PT 12 seconds, and PTT 43 seconds. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient’s symptoms?
Options:
A. Hemophilia A
B. Lupus anticoagulant
C. Protein C deficiency
D. Von Willebrand disease
