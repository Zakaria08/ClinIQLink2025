        "content": "Recurrent, severe, or unusual infections in pediatric patients warrant comprehensive immunological evaluation to identify underlying immune deficiencies. While multiple immune compartments may demonstrate dysfunction, complement deficiencies represent a clinically significant category with distinctive infection susceptibility patterns. The complement system, comprising over 30 soluble and membrane-bound proteins, functions through three activation pathways (classical, alternative, and lectin) converging on a terminal sequence leading to membrane attack complex (MAC) formation. Deficiencies affecting this terminal complement pathway\u2014specifically components C5 through C9\u2014result in a characteristic predisposition to recurrent Neisserial infections, particularly Neisseria meningitidis. Unlike early complement component deficiencies (C1, C2, C4) predominantly associated with autoimmune manifestations, terminal complement deficiencies typically present with recurrent, often severe bacterial infections with relatively normal immune function against other pathogens. The terminal complement sequence initiates with C5 convertase-mediated cleavage of C5 into C5a (an anaphylatoxin) and C5b. C5b subsequently binds sequentially to C6, C7, C8, and multiple C9 molecules, forming the C5b-9 complex (MAC). This transmembrane pore disrupts cellular integrity through osmotic lysis, providing critical defense against Gram-negative bacteria, particularly encapsulated species like Neisseria. The predilection for Neisserial infections reflects the unique importance of MAC-mediated lysis in defense against these organisms, which otherwise resist phagocytosis through their polysaccharide capsules. Patients with terminal complement deficiencies typically experience normal immune responses to most pathogens, maintaining intact phagocytic function, cell-mediated immunity, and antibody production. Clinical manifestations include recurrent meningococcal meningitis, meningococcemia, and other Neisserial infections such as recurrent gonococcal infections, often with atypical serotypes. Diagnostic evaluation includes CH50 assay measuring the classical pathway's functional activity, specific component assays, and potentially genetic testing. Management centers on prophylactic measures including vaccination against Neisseria meningitidis (including non-standard serotypes), antibiotic prophylaxis consideration, and patient education regarding infection recognition and prompt medical attention for febrile illnesses.",

        "title": "A short stay or 23 hour ward in a general and academic childrens hospital Are they effective",
        "content": "Objective: We evaluated the usefulness of a short stay or 23 hour ward in a pediatric unit of a large teaching hospital, Westmead Hospital, and an academic Children\u2019s hospital, The New Children\u2019s Hospital, to determine if they are a useful addition to the emergency service. Methods: This is a descriptive comparison of prospectively collected data on all children admitted to the short stay ward at Westmead Hospital (WH) during 1994 and the short stay ward at the New Children\u2019s Hospital (NCH) during 1997\u201398. These hospitals service an identical demographic area with the latter (NCH) a tertiary referral center. The following outcome measures were used: length of stay, appropriateness of stay, rate of admission to an in hospital bed, and rate of unscheduled visits within 72 hours of discharge. Adverse events were reported and patient follow up was attempted at 48 hours after discharge in all cases. Results: The short stay ward accounted for 10.3% (Westmead Hospital) and 14.7% (New Children\u2019s Hospital) of admissions, with 56% medical in nature, 30% surgical, and the remainder procedural or psychological. Admission patterns were similar, with asthma, gastroenteritis, convulsion, pneumonia, and simple surgical conditions accounting for most short stay ward admissions. The short stay ward increased hospital efficiency with an average length of stay of 17.5 hours (Westmead Hospital) compared to 20.5 hours (New Children\u2019s Hospital). The users of the short stay ward were children of young age less than 2 years, with stay greater than 23 hours reported in only 1% of all admissions to the short stay ward. The rate of patient admission to an in hospital bed was low, (4% [Westmead Hospital] compared to 6% [New Children\u2019s Hospital]), with the number of unscheduled visits within 72 hours of short stay ward discharge less than 1%. There were no adverse events reported at either short stay ward, with parental satisfaction high. The short stay ward was developed through reallocation of resources from within the hospital to the short stay ward. This resulted in estimated savings of $1/2 million (Westmead Hospital) to $2.3 million (New Children\u2019s Hospital) to the hospital, due to more efficient bed usage. Conclusion: This data demonstrates the robust nature of the short stay ward. At these two very different institutions we have shown improved bed efficient and patient care in a cost effective way. We have also reported on greater parental satisfaction and early return of the child with their family to the community.",

        "title": "Ethylene glycol poisoning",
        "content": "Signs and symptoms Signs of ethylene glycol poisoning depend upon the time after ingestion. Symptoms usually follow a three step progression, although poisoned individuals will not always develop each stage. Stage 1 (30 minutes to 12 hours) consists of neurological and gastrointestinal symptoms and looks similar to alcohol poisoning. Poisoned individuals may appear to be intoxicated, dizzy, lacking coordination of muscle movements, drooling, depressed, and have slurred speech, seizures, abnormal eye movements, headaches, and confusion. Irritation to the stomach may cause nausea and vomiting. Also seen are excessive thirst and urination. Over time, the body metabolizes ethylene glycol into other toxins. Stage 2 (12 to 36 hours) where signs of \u201calcohol\u201d poisoning appear to resolve, underlying severe internal damage is still occurring. An elevated heart rate, hyperventilation or increased breathing effort, and dehydration may start to develop, along with high blood pressure and metabolic acidosis. These symptoms are a result of accumulation of organic acids formed by the metabolism of ethylene glycol. Additionally low calcium concentrations in the blood, overactive muscle reflexes, muscle spasms, QT interval prolongation, and congestive heart failure may occur. If untreated, death most commonly occurs during this period. Stage 3 (24 to 72 hours) kidney failure is the result of ethylene glycol poisoning. In cats, this stage occurs 12\u201324 hours after consuming antifreeze; in dogs, at 36\u201372 hours after consuming antifreeze. During this stage, severe kidney failure is developing secondary to calcium oxalate crystals forming in the kidneys. Severe lethargy, coma, depression, vomiting, seizures, drooling, and inappetence may be seen. Other symptoms include acute tubular necrosis, red blood cells in the urine, excess proteins in the urine, lower back pain, decreased or absent production of urine, elevated blood concentration of potassium, and acute kidney failure. If kidney failure occurs it is typically reversible, although weeks or months of supportive care including hemodialysis may be required before kidney function returns.",
