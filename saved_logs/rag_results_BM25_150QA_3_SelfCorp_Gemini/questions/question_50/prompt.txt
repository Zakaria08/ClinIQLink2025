Document 1 (Title: Etiology and Pathophysiology of Spontaneous Abortion): First-trimester pregnancy loss, clinically defined as spontaneous abortion before 13 weeks gestation, affects approximately 10-20% of clinically recognized pregnancies, with significantly higher rates when considering pre-clinical losses. While multiple etiologies contribute to early pregnancy failure, chromosomal abnormalities represent the predominant cause, accounting for approximately 50-60% of first-trimester losses. These cytogenetic aberrations predominantly arise from errors during gametogenesis or early embryonic divisions, with advancing maternal age significantly increasing risk, particularly for aneuploidies. Autosomal trisomies constitute the most common chromosomal abnormality, with trisomy 16 appearing most frequently, followed by trisomies 22, 21, and 18. Polyploidy, particularly triploidy, represents another significant cytogenetic abnormality, often associated with partial molar pregnancies. Structural chromosomal abnormalities, including translocations and inversions, contribute less frequently to sporadic losses but become increasingly significant in recurrent pregnancy loss. The pathophysiological mechanism typically involves disrupted embryonic development due to altered gene dosage, ultimately culminating in embryonic demise and subsequent expulsion. Clinical manifestations follow a characteristic sequence, beginning with embryonic death, followed by cessation of hormone production, declining progesterone and human chorionic gonadotropin levels, destabilization of the decidual-trophoblastic interface, and finally uterine contractions with expulsion of products of conception. Alternative etiologies include maternal factors such as endocrine disorders (thyroid dysfunction, uncontrolled diabetes), uterine anatomic abnormalities (septate uterus, submucosal leiomyomas), and thrombophilic conditions (antiphospholipid syndrome, inherited thrombophilias). Immunological factors, particularly alloimmune mechanisms, remain controversial and incompletely understood. External factors such as maternal exposure to toxins, including alcohol, tobacco, and certain medications, may increase risk, albeit less significantly than chromosomal factors. Physical trauma rarely causes early pregnancy loss unless associated with direct uterine injury or significant maternal hemodynamic compromise. Comprehensive evaluation for specific etiology typically follows recurrent pregnancy loss (traditionally defined as three or more consecutive losses), though contemporary approaches often initiate investigation after two losses, particularly in women of advanced reproductive age.
Document 2 (Title: Coagulation Defects in Young Women with Menorrhagia): Menorrhagia, defined as excessive menstrual bleeding lasting more than 7 days or exceeding 80 mL per cycle, affects approximately 10-30% of women of reproductive age, with a significant proportion attributable to underlying bleeding disorders. When persistent since menarche and accompanied by other mucocutaneous bleeding manifestations, inherited coagulation disorders warrant particular consideration. Von Willebrand disease (VWD), the most common inherited bleeding disorder, affects approximately 1% of the general population and accounts for up to 20% of unexplained menorrhagia cases in otherwise healthy women. VWD results from quantitative or qualitative deficiencies in von Willebrand factor (VWF), a large multimeric glycoprotein that mediates platelet adhesion to subendothelial collagen and serves as a carrier for factor VIII. This autosomal inheritance pattern leads to equal sex distribution, contrasting with the X-linked recessive inheritance of hemophilia A, which primarily affects males. Laboratory evaluation of VWD typically reveals prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) due to secondary factor VIII deficiency, while prothrombin time (PT) and platelet count remain normal. Patients typically present with mucocutaneous bleeding manifestations including easy bruising, epistaxis, gingival bleeding, and particularly menorrhagia in women. Family history often reveals similar bleeding tendencies in first-degree relatives of both sexes, contrasting with the maternal uncle pattern in hemophilia A or the prothrombotic tendencies in conditions like protein C deficiency or antiphospholipid syndrome.
Document 3 (Title: Growth promoting effects of IGF-1): The first demonstration that exogenous IGF-1 stimulates growth was the administration of purified hormone to hypophysectomised rats. After the biosynthesis of IGF-1 identical to the native hormone, trials of its use in humans were begun; first in adults and then in children. Our group was the first to introduce long term administration of biosynthetic IGF-1 to children with primary IGF-1 deficiency—primary GH insensitivity or LS. The finding that daily IGF-1 administration raises serum alkaline phosphatase, which is an indicator of osteoblastic activity, and serum procollagen, in addition to IGFBP-3, led to long term treatment. Treatment of patients with LS was also initiated in other parts of the world. The difference between us and the other groups was that we used a once daily dose, whereas the others administered IGF-1 twice daily. Table 1 compares the linear growth response of children with LS treated by four different groups. It can be seen that before treatment the mean growth velocity was 3–4.7 cm/year and that this increased after IGF-1 treatment to 8.2–9.1 cm/year, followed by a lower velocity of 5.5–6.4 cm/year in the next two years. (In GH treatment the highest growth velocity registered is also in the first year of treatment.) Figure 5 illustrates the growth response to IGF-1 in eight children during the first years of treatment. Ranke and colleagues reported that two of their patients had reached the third centile (Tanner), as did the patient of Krzisnik and Battelino; however, most patients did not reach a normal final height. The reasons may be late initiation of treatment, irregular IGF-1 administration, underdosage, etc. Ranke et al conclude that long term treatment of patients with LS promoted growth and, if treatment is started at an early age, there is a considerable potential for achieving height normalisation. Because no patient in our group was treated since early infancy to final height we cannot confirm this opinion. When the growth response to GH treatment in infants with IGHD was compared with that of IGF-1 in infants with LS we found that the infants with IGHD responded faster and better than those with LS. However, the small number of patients and the differences in growth retardation between the two groups makes it difficult to reach a conclusion. Both hormones stimulated linear growth, but GH seemed more effective than IGF-1. One cause may be the greater growth deficit of the infants with LS than those with IGHD, an insufficient dose of IGF-1, or that there is a need for some GH to provide an adequate stem cell population of prechondrocytes to enable full expression of the growth promoting action of IGF-1, as postulated by Green and colleagues and Ohlson et al. All the above findings based on a few clinical studies with small groups of patients and a few experimental studies remain at present controversial. The crucial question is whether there are any, and if so, whether there are sufficient IGF-1 receptors in the “progenitor cartilage zone” of the epiphyseal cartilage to respond to endocrine and exogenous IGF-1. Using the mandibular condyle of 2 day old ICR mice, Maor et al showed that these condyles, which resemble the epiphyseal plates of the long bones, contain IGF-1 and high affinity IGF-1 receptors also in the chondroprogenitor cell layers, which enables them to respond to IGF-1 in vitro. Sims et al, using mice with GH receptor KO, showed that IGF-1 administration stimulates the growth (width) of the tibial growth plate and that IGF-1 has a GH independent effect on the growth plate. These findings are similar to those found when treating hypophysectomised rats with IGF-1. In conclusion, IGF-1 is an important growth hormone, mediating the anabolic and linear growth promoting effect of pituitary GH protein. It has a GH independent growth stimulating effect, which with respect to cartilage cells is possibly optimised by the synergistic action with GH.

Answer the following multiple-choice question.
Question: A 23-year-old G1 at 10 weeks gestation based on her last menstrual period is brought to the emergency department by her husband due to sudden vaginal bleeding. She says that she has mild lower abdominal cramps and is feeling dizzy and weak. Her blood pressure is 100/60 mm Hg, the pulse is 100/min, and the respiration rate is 15/min. She says that she has had light spotting over the last 3 days, but today the bleeding increased markedly and she also noticed the passage of clots. She says that she has changed three pads since the morning. She has also noticed that the nausea she was experiencing over the past few days has subsided. The physician examines her and notes that the cervical os is open and blood is pooling in the vagina. Products of conception can be visualized in the os. The patient is prepared for a suction curettage. Which of the following is the most likely cause for the pregnancy loss?
Options:
A. Rh immunization
B. Antiphospholipid syndrome
C. Chromosomal abnormalities
D. Trauma
