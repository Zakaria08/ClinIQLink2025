        "content": "Defense mechanisms represent unconscious psychological operations that protect individuals from unacceptable thoughts, impulses, or emotions. While serving adaptive functions in maintaining psychological equilibrium, these mechanisms can become maladaptive when excessively rigid or immature. Adolescence represents a developmental period characterized by significant psychological reorganization and heightened vulnerability to psychological distress, often accompanied by prominent deployment of defense mechanisms. The repertoire and maturity of defense mechanisms employed evolve throughout development, with more primitive mechanisms predominating earlier and more mature mechanisms emerging with psychological development. Acting out describes a particular defense mechanism involving the expression of unconscious emotional conflicts through behavior rather than verbal articulation or conscious awareness. This mechanism typically manifests as impulsive actions that serve to discharge tensions associated with conflictual feelings, thus temporarily reducing anxiety while avoiding conscious confrontation with the underlying conflict. In adolescents experiencing significant family disruption, such as parental separation or divorce, acting out behaviors may represent unconscious expressions of anger, abandonment anxiety, or attempts to regain control in an environment perceived as unstable. The clinical presentation typically involves a marked behavioral change from previous patterns, with conduct that appears purposefully provocative or self-destructive, including truancy, substance use, sexual acting out, or aggressive behaviors. This contrasts with other defense mechanisms including projection, wherein unacceptable internal impulses are attributed to others; passive aggression, where resistance manifests through passive means including procrastination or intentional inefficiency; and regression, characterized by reversion to earlier developmental behaviors in response to stress. Treatment approaches incorporate both supportive interventions addressing immediate behavioral concerns and exploratory techniques to enhance self-awareness regarding underlying emotional conflicts.",

        "content": "1. Vertical-Banded Gastroplasty (CPT code 43842) Vertical-banded gastroplasty was formerly one of the most common gastric restrictive procedures performed in the United States but has now been replaced by other restrictive procedures due to high rates of revisions and reoperations. In this procedure, the stomach is segmented along its vertical axis. To create a durable reinforced and rate-limiting stoma at the distal end of the pouch, a plug of stomach is removed, and a propylene collar is placed through this hole and then stapled to itself. Because the normal flow of food is preserved, metabolic complications are uncommon. Complications include esophageal reflux, dilation, or obstruction of the stoma, with the latter two requiring reoperation. Dilation of the stoma is a common reason for weight regain. Vertical-banded gastroplasty may be performed using an open or laparoscopic approach. 2. Adjustable Gastric Banding (CPT code 43770) Adjustable gastric banding involves placing a gastric band around the exterior of the stomach. The band is attached to a reservoir that is implanted subcutaneously in the rectus sheath. Injecting the reservoir with saline will alter the diameter of the gastric band; therefore, the rate-limiting stoma in the stomach can be progressively narrowed to induce greater weight loss, or expanded if complications develop. Because the stomach is not entered, the surgery and any revisions, if necessary, are relatively simple. Complications include slippage of the external band or band erosion through the gastric wall. Currently, two such devices are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for marketing in the United States. The first to receive FDA approval was the LapBand (Apollo Endosurgery). The labeled indications for Lap Band devices are as follows: \"The Lap-Band system is indicated for use in weight reduction for severely obese patients with a body mass index (BMI) of at least 40 or a BMI of at least 35 with one or more severe comorbid conditions, or those who are 100 lbs or more over their estimated ideal weight according to the 1983 Metropolitan Life Insurance Tables (use the midpoint for medium frame). It is indicated for use only in severely obese adult patients who have failed more conservative weight-reduction alternatives, such as supervised diet, exercise and behavior modification programs. Patients who elect to have this surgery must make the commitment to accept significant changes in their eating habits for the rest of their lives.\" In 2011, FDA-labelled indications for the LAP-BAND were expanded to include patients with a BMI from 30 to 34 with at least 1 obesity-related comorbid condition. The second adjustable gastric banding device was approved by the FDA through the Premarket Approval (PMA) process in September 2007, the REALIZE model (Ethicon Endosurgery, Cincinnati, OH). Labeled indications for this device are as listed below: \"The [REALIZE] device is indicated for weight reduction for morbidly obese patients and is indicated for individuals with a BMI of at least 40 kg/m2, or a BMI of at least 35 kg/m2 with one or more comorbid conditions. The band is indicated for use only in morbidly obese adult patients who have failed more conservative weight-reduction alternatives, such as supervised diet, exercise, and behavior modification programs.\" 3. Sleeve gastrectomy (CPT code 43775) A sleeve gastrectomy is an alternative approach to gastrectomy that can be performed on its own, or in combination with malabsorptive procedures (most commonly biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch). In this procedure, the greater curvature of the stomach is resected from the angle of His to the distal antrum, resulting in a stomach remnant shaped like a tube or sleeve. The pyloric sphincter is preserved, resulting in a more physiologic transit of food from the stomach to the duodenum, and avoiding the dumping syndrome (overly rapid transport of food through stomach into intestines) that is seen with distal gastrectomy. This procedure can be done by the open or laparoscopic technique. Some surgeons have proposed this as the first in a two-stage procedure for very high-risk patients. Weight loss following sleeve gastrectomy may improve a patient\u2019s overall medical status, and thus reduce the risk of a subsequent more extensive malabsorptive procedure, such as biliopancreatic diversion.",

        "content": "Electronic health record interventions designed to prompt primary care providers about familial risk factors have demonstrated inconsistent implementation results across healthcare systems. Recent multicenter evaluations revealed that automated family history alerts resulted in minimal change to physician documentation patterns or referral behaviors despite technological investment. The INHERIT trial, examining 124 primary care practices, found no statistically significant difference in risk-appropriate screening rates between intervention and control groups at 18-month follow-up. Provider surveys indicated that 67% of clinicians reported ignoring automated family history prompts due to existing workflow constraints and alert fatigue. Implementation science research continues to identify substantial barriers to effective family history integration, with time limitations and competing clinical priorities consistently emerging as limiting factors. While the theoretical value of family history in risk stratification remains well-established, translating this into actionable clinical behavior change has proven challenging. Current evidence suggests that without substantial workflow redesign and provider education, technological prompting alone produces limited behavioral change in primary care settings. Qualitative analysis has identified that isolated alerting systems without integrated decision support tools and streamlined workflows demonstrate particularly poor adoption and limited clinical impact.",
