        "content": "Continuing Education Activity Amitriptyline is in the tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) drug classification and acts by blocking the reuptake of both serotonin and norepinephrine neurotransmitters. Amitriptyline is an FDA-approved medication to treat depression in adults. The non-FDA approved indications are anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, insomnia, chronic pain (diabetic neuropathy, fibromyalgia), irritable bowel syndrome, interstitial cystitis (bladder pain syndrome), migraine prophylaxis, postherpetic neuralgia, and sialorrhea. This activity reviews the indications, contraindications, activity, adverse events, and other key elements of amitryptiline in the clinical setting related to the essential points needed by members of an interprofessional team managing the care of patients with indications that can benefit from amitriptyline therapy. Amitriptyline is in the tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) drug classification and acts by blocking the reuptake of both serotonin and norepinephrine neurotransmitters. The three-ring central structure and a side chain are the basic structure of tricyclic antidepressants. Amitriptyline is a tertiary amine with strong binding affinities for alpha-adrenergic, histamine (H1), and muscarinic (M1) receptors.[6] Amitriptyline increases noradrenergic or serotonergic neurotransmission by blocking the norepinephrine or serotonin transporter (NET or SERT) at presynaptic terminals. Chronic treatment with amitriptyline desensitizes presynaptic autoreceptors and heteroreceptors, producing long-lasting changes in monoaminergic neurotransmission.[7] Amitryptiline is more sedating and has increased anticholinergic properties than other TCAs. As with other antidepressants, the onset of therapeutic action typically begins at approximately 2 to 4 weeks. Amitriptyline toxicity can be serious and even fatal. In treating the toxicity, the top priority is stabilizing the patient, which may require admission to the ICU for monitoring. The most important steps include - protecting the airways, breathing, and stabilizing circulation. Some patients may need tracheal intubation; if required, administer supplemental oxygen. All patients suspected of tricyclic antidepressant overdose should receive gastrointestinal decontamination. This should include large-volume gastric lavage followed by activated charcoal.[41] Seizures secondary to overdose are treatable with diazepam or lorazepam. If the patient is hypotensive, an IV bolus of isotonic crystalloid is a therapeutic option. Vasopressors are the next choice if the patient remains hypotensive despite fluid resuscitation. If QRS exceeds 100 msec, intravenous sodium bicarbonate is the appropriate intervention. Sodium bicarbonate is cardioprotective (it increases extracellular sodium concentration) and diminishes the effect of amitriptyline on the cardiac membrane, resulting in less sodium channel blockage. Alkalization favors the neutral form of amitriptyline and decreases the amount of active cyclic antidepressants.",

        "title": "Growth promoting effects of IGF-1",
        "content": "The first demonstration that exogenous IGF-1 stimulates growth was the administration of purified hormone to hypophysectomised rats. After the biosynthesis of IGF-1 identical to the native hormone, trials of its use in humans were begun; first in adults and then in children. Our group was the first to introduce long term administration of biosynthetic IGF-1 to children with primary IGF-1 deficiency\u2014primary GH insensitivity or LS. The finding that daily IGF-1 administration raises serum alkaline phosphatase, which is an indicator of osteoblastic activity, and serum procollagen, in addition to IGFBP-3, led to long term treatment. Treatment of patients with LS was also initiated in other parts of the world. The difference between us and the other groups was that we used a once daily dose, whereas the others administered IGF-1 twice daily. Table 1 compares the linear growth response of children with LS treated by four different groups. It can be seen that before treatment the mean growth velocity was 3\u20134.7 cm/year and that this increased after IGF-1 treatment to 8.2\u20139.1 cm/year, followed by a lower velocity of 5.5\u20136.4 cm/year in the next two years. (In GH treatment the highest growth velocity registered is also in the first year of treatment.) Figure 5 illustrates the growth response to IGF-1 in eight children during the first years of treatment. Ranke and colleagues reported that two of their patients had reached the third centile (Tanner), as did the patient of Krzisnik and Battelino; however, most patients did not reach a normal final height. The reasons may be late initiation of treatment, irregular IGF-1 administration, underdosage, etc. Ranke et al conclude that long term treatment of patients with LS promoted growth and, if treatment is started at an early age, there is a considerable potential for achieving height normalisation. Because no patient in our group was treated since early infancy to final height we cannot confirm this opinion. When the growth response to GH treatment in infants with IGHD was compared with that of IGF-1 in infants with LS we found that the infants with IGHD responded faster and better than those with LS. However, the small number of patients and the differences in growth retardation between the two groups makes it difficult to reach a conclusion. Both hormones stimulated linear growth, but GH seemed more effective than IGF-1. One cause may be the greater growth deficit of the infants with LS than those with IGHD, an insufficient dose of IGF-1, or that there is a need for some GH to provide an adequate stem cell population of prechondrocytes to enable full expression of the growth promoting action of IGF-1, as postulated by Green and colleagues and Ohlson et al. All the above findings based on a few clinical studies with small groups of patients and a few experimental studies remain at present controversial. The crucial question is whether there are any, and if so, whether there are sufficient IGF-1 receptors in the \u201cprogenitor cartilage zone\u201d of the epiphyseal cartilage to respond to endocrine and exogenous IGF-1. Using the mandibular condyle of 2 day old ICR mice, Maor et al showed that these condyles, which resemble the epiphyseal plates of the long bones, contain IGF-1 and high affinity IGF-1 receptors also in the chondroprogenitor cell layers, which enables them to respond to IGF-1 in vitro. Sims et al, using mice with GH receptor KO, showed that IGF-1 administration stimulates the growth (width) of the tibial growth plate and that IGF-1 has a GH independent effect on the growth plate. These findings are similar to those found when treating hypophysectomised rats with IGF-1. In conclusion, IGF-1 is an important growth hormone, mediating the anabolic and linear growth promoting effect of pituitary GH protein. It has a GH independent growth stimulating effect, which with respect to cartilage cells is possibly optimised by the synergistic action with GH.",
