Document 1 (Title: Pathophysiology of Progressive Kidney Disease): Chronic renal failure represents the final common pathway of numerous kidney diseases characterized by irreversible nephron loss and progressive deterioration of renal function. Pathological examination demonstrates ongoing nephron destruction through various mechanisms including glomerulosclerosis, tubulointerstitial fibrosis, and vascular alterations, with compensatory hyperfiltration in remaining nephrons ultimately accelerating their deterioration. Laboratory assessment reveals characteristic patterns including decreased glomerular filtration rate most accurately reflected through reduced creatinine clearance measurements, providing quantitative assessment of disease progression and severity. Electrolyte derangements develop in predictable patterns, with calcium metabolism particularly affected through multiple mechanisms. Hypocalcemia commonly develops through reduced 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D synthesis, phosphate retention, skeletal resistance to parathyroid hormone, and calcium-phosphate deposition in soft tissues. Hematological complications prominently feature normocytic anemia resulting from decreased erythropoietin production, uremic inhibitors of erythropoiesis, shortened red cell survival, and occasional blood loss from uremic platelet dysfunction. Acid-base regulation becomes progressively impaired as nephron mass declines, with metabolic acidosis developing through reduced hydrogen ion excretion and bicarbonate regeneration. This acidosis further complicates protein metabolism, bone disease, and muscle catabolism. Potassium homeostasis typically remains relatively preserved until advanced disease stages, with hyperkalemia rather than hypokalemia characterizing end-stage renal failure as adaptive increases in colonic potassium secretion eventually prove insufficient to maintain normal serum levels. This constellation of pathophysiological changes creates the characteristic clinical and laboratory presentation of advanced kidney disease, guiding both supportive management approaches and decisions regarding renal replacement therapy initiation.
Document 2 (Title: Urinary Obstruction and Stasis   Kidney): The pressure within the renal pelvis is normally close to zero. When this pressure increases because of obstruction or reflux, the pelvis and calyces dilate. The degree of hydronephrosis that develops depends on the duration, degree, and site of the obstruction (Figure 12–4). The higher the obstruction, the greater the effect on the kidney. If the renal pelvis is entirely intrarenal and the obstruction is at the ureteropelvic junction, all the pressure will be exerted on the parenchyma (Klein et al., 2010). If the renal pelvis is extrarenal, only part of the pressure produced by a ureteropelvic stenosis is exerted on the parenchyma; this is because the extrarenal pelvis is embedded in fat and dilates more readily, thus "decompressing" the hydronephrotic left renal pelvis. Low density mass (P) in the left renal sinus had an attenuation value similar to that of water, suggesting the correct diagnosis. Unless intravenous contrast material is used, differentiation from a peripelvic cyst may be difficult. In the earlier stages, the renal pelvic musculature undergoes compensatory hypertrophy in its effort to force urine past the obstruction. Later, however, the muscle becomes stretched and atonic and decompensated. The progression of hydronephrotic atrophy is as follows (Chevalier, 2010; Rodriguez, 2004): 1. The earliest changes in the development of hydronephrosis are seen in the calyces. The end of a normal calyx is concave because of the papilla that projects into it; with increased intrapelvic pressure, the fornices become blunt and rounded. With persistence of increased intrapelvic pressure, the papilla becomes flattened, then convex (clubbed) as a result of compression enhanced by ischemic atrophy (Figure 12–5). The parenchyma between the calyces is affected to a lesser extent. The changes in the renal parenchyma are due to (a) compression atrophy from increased intrapelvic pressure (more accentuated with intrarenal pelves) and (b) ischemic atrophy from hemodynamic changes, mainly manifested in arcuate vessels that run at the base of the pyramids parallel to the kidney outline and are more vulnerable to compression between the renal capsule and the centrally increasing intrapelvic pressure. 2. This spotty atrophy is caused by the nature of the blood supply of the kidney. The arterioles are end arteries; therefore, ischemia is most marked in the areas farthest from the interlobular arteries. As the back pressure increases, hydronephrosis progresses, with the cells nearest the main arteries exhibiting the greatest resistance. 3. This increased pressure is transmitted up the tubules. The tubules become dilated, and their cells atrophy from ischemia. It should be pointed out that a few instances of dilated renal pelves and calyces are not due to the presence of obstruction. Rarely, the renal cavities are congenitally capacious and thus simulate hydronephrosis. More commonly, hydronephrosis may occur in childhood owing to the back pressure associated with vesicoureteral reflux. If the valvular incompetence resolves (and this is common), some degree of the hydronephrotic changes may persist. These persisting changes may cause the physician to suspect the presence of obstruction, which may lead to unnecessary surgery. A radioisotope renogram to assess ureteral drainage function can be performed to determine whether organic obstruction is present. 4. Only in unilateral hydronephrosis are the advanced stages of hydronephrotic atrophy seen. Eventually, the kidney is completely destroyed and appears as a thin walled sac filled with clear fluid (water and electrolytes) or pus (Figure 12–6).
Document 3 (Title: Ethylene glycol poisoning): Signs and symptoms Signs of ethylene glycol poisoning depend upon the time after ingestion. Symptoms usually follow a three step progression, although poisoned individuals will not always develop each stage. Stage 1 (30 minutes to 12 hours) consists of neurological and gastrointestinal symptoms and looks similar to alcohol poisoning. Poisoned individuals may appear to be intoxicated, dizzy, lacking coordination of muscle movements, drooling, depressed, and have slurred speech, seizures, abnormal eye movements, headaches, and confusion. Irritation to the stomach may cause nausea and vomiting. Also seen are excessive thirst and urination. Over time, the body metabolizes ethylene glycol into other toxins. Stage 2 (12 to 36 hours) where signs of “alcohol” poisoning appear to resolve, underlying severe internal damage is still occurring. An elevated heart rate, hyperventilation or increased breathing effort, and dehydration may start to develop, along with high blood pressure and metabolic acidosis. These symptoms are a result of accumulation of organic acids formed by the metabolism of ethylene glycol. Additionally low calcium concentrations in the blood, overactive muscle reflexes, muscle spasms, QT interval prolongation, and congestive heart failure may occur. If untreated, death most commonly occurs during this period. Stage 3 (24 to 72 hours) kidney failure is the result of ethylene glycol poisoning. In cats, this stage occurs 12–24 hours after consuming antifreeze; in dogs, at 36–72 hours after consuming antifreeze. During this stage, severe kidney failure is developing secondary to calcium oxalate crystals forming in the kidneys. Severe lethargy, coma, depression, vomiting, seizures, drooling, and inappetence may be seen. Other symptoms include acute tubular necrosis, red blood cells in the urine, excess proteins in the urine, lower back pain, decreased or absent production of urine, elevated blood concentration of potassium, and acute kidney failure. If kidney failure occurs it is typically reversible, although weeks or months of supportive care including hemodialysis may be required before kidney function returns.
