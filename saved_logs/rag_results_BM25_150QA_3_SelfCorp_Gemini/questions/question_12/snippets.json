        "content": "1. Vertical-Banded Gastroplasty (CPT code 43842) Vertical-banded gastroplasty was formerly one of the most common gastric restrictive procedures performed in the United States but has now been replaced by other restrictive procedures due to high rates of revisions and reoperations. In this procedure, the stomach is segmented along its vertical axis. To create a durable reinforced and rate-limiting stoma at the distal end of the pouch, a plug of stomach is removed, and a propylene collar is placed through this hole and then stapled to itself. Because the normal flow of food is preserved, metabolic complications are uncommon. Complications include esophageal reflux, dilation, or obstruction of the stoma, with the latter two requiring reoperation. Dilation of the stoma is a common reason for weight regain. Vertical-banded gastroplasty may be performed using an open or laparoscopic approach. 2. Adjustable Gastric Banding (CPT code 43770) Adjustable gastric banding involves placing a gastric band around the exterior of the stomach. The band is attached to a reservoir that is implanted subcutaneously in the rectus sheath. Injecting the reservoir with saline will alter the diameter of the gastric band; therefore, the rate-limiting stoma in the stomach can be progressively narrowed to induce greater weight loss, or expanded if complications develop. Because the stomach is not entered, the surgery and any revisions, if necessary, are relatively simple. Complications include slippage of the external band or band erosion through the gastric wall. Currently, two such devices are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for marketing in the United States. The first to receive FDA approval was the LapBand (Apollo Endosurgery). The labeled indications for Lap Band devices are as follows: \"The Lap-Band system is indicated for use in weight reduction for severely obese patients with a body mass index (BMI) of at least 40 or a BMI of at least 35 with one or more severe comorbid conditions, or those who are 100 lbs or more over their estimated ideal weight according to the 1983 Metropolitan Life Insurance Tables (use the midpoint for medium frame). It is indicated for use only in severely obese adult patients who have failed more conservative weight-reduction alternatives, such as supervised diet, exercise and behavior modification programs. Patients who elect to have this surgery must make the commitment to accept significant changes in their eating habits for the rest of their lives.\" In 2011, FDA-labelled indications for the LAP-BAND were expanded to include patients with a BMI from 30 to 34 with at least 1 obesity-related comorbid condition. The second adjustable gastric banding device was approved by the FDA through the Premarket Approval (PMA) process in September 2007, the REALIZE model (Ethicon Endosurgery, Cincinnati, OH). Labeled indications for this device are as listed below: \"The [REALIZE] device is indicated for weight reduction for morbidly obese patients and is indicated for individuals with a BMI of at least 40 kg/m2, or a BMI of at least 35 kg/m2 with one or more comorbid conditions. The band is indicated for use only in morbidly obese adult patients who have failed more conservative weight-reduction alternatives, such as supervised diet, exercise, and behavior modification programs.\" 3. Sleeve gastrectomy (CPT code 43775) A sleeve gastrectomy is an alternative approach to gastrectomy that can be performed on its own, or in combination with malabsorptive procedures (most commonly biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch). In this procedure, the greater curvature of the stomach is resected from the angle of His to the distal antrum, resulting in a stomach remnant shaped like a tube or sleeve. The pyloric sphincter is preserved, resulting in a more physiologic transit of food from the stomach to the duodenum, and avoiding the dumping syndrome (overly rapid transport of food through stomach into intestines) that is seen with distal gastrectomy. This procedure can be done by the open or laparoscopic technique. Some surgeons have proposed this as the first in a two-stage procedure for very high-risk patients. Weight loss following sleeve gastrectomy may improve a patient\u2019s overall medical status, and thus reduce the risk of a subsequent more extensive malabsorptive procedure, such as biliopancreatic diversion.",

        "content": "Myasthenia gravis (MG) represents the prototypical autoimmune disorder of neuromuscular transmission, characterized by fluctuating skeletal muscle weakness that worsens with sustained activity and improves with rest. The disease results from antibody-mediated attack against components of the postsynaptic membrane at the neuromuscular junction, predominantly targeting the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR). In approximately 85% of patients with generalized MG, serum antibodies against AChR are detectable. These antibodies, predominantly of the IgG1 and IgG3 subclasses, induce pathological changes through three principal mechanisms: complement-mediated destruction of the postsynaptic membrane, accelerated internalization and degradation of cross-linked receptors, and functional receptor blockade preventing acetylcholine binding. The cumulative effect reduces the efficiency of neuromuscular transmission, with clinical weakness manifesting when transmission fails at a critical proportion of muscle fibers. In seronegative cases, approximately 40% harbor antibodies against muscle-specific kinase (MuSK), a postsynaptic membrane protein involved in AChR clustering. Additional antigenic targets include lipoprotein receptor-related protein 4 (LRP4) and agrin. Clinical manifestations reflect the distribution of affected muscles, with ocular involvement (ptosis and diplopia) representing the initial presentation in approximately 85% of cases. Involvement of bulbar musculature produces dysarthria, dysphagia, and facial weakness, while limb-girdle muscles show characteristic fatigability with sustained or repeated activity. Distinctive features include the predilection for cranial nerve-innervated muscles, diurnal fluctuation with evening worsening, and sparing of pupillary responses. Diagnostic approaches include serological testing, electrophysiological studies demonstrating decremental response to repetitive nerve stimulation, and the edrophonium (Tensilon) test, which produces transient improvement by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase and increasing available acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction. Management strategies encompass symptomatic treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors, immunomodulation through corticosteroids and steroid-sparing agents, and more targeted approaches including thymectomy, plasmapheresis, and monoclonal antibody therapy.",

        "title": "Neurotoxin-Mediated Paralytic Syndromes in Pediatrics",
        "content": "Infant botulism represents a rare but potentially life-threatening neuroparalytic disorder affecting children under 12 months of age, with peak incidence between 2-6 months. Unlike foodborne botulism in adults, which results from ingestion of preformed toxin, infant botulism occurs when ingested Clostridium botulinum spores colonize the immature intestinal tract and produce botulinum neurotoxin in situ. The pathophysiological hallmark involves the irreversible binding of botulinum toxin to presynaptic nerve terminals at the neuromuscular junction, where it prevents calcium-dependent release of acetylcholine-containing vesicles. The resulting chemical denervation manifests as a descending, symmetric flaccid paralysis, classically described as progressing from cranial nerves to trunk, extremities, and respiratory muscles. Early clinical features include poor feeding, weak cry, decreased facial expression, and hypotonia, often misattributed to sepsis or metabolic disorders. Cranial nerve dysfunction produces the characteristic findings of ptosis, ophthalmoplegia, and impaired pupillary light reflexes. Constipation, a frequent early sign, results from autonomic involvement and decreased intestinal motility. Progressive weakness may culminate in respiratory insufficiency requiring mechanical ventilation. Laboratory diagnosis relies on detection of botulinum toxin or C. botulinum in stool specimens, as EMG studies showing decreased amplitude of compound muscle action potentials with rapid fade during repetitive stimulation may be difficult to perform in infants. Primary prevention focuses on avoiding potential sources of spores, particularly honey and environmental exposures such as construction sites or agriculturally disturbed soil.",
